If this post feels disjointed, I can't dispute that.  Over the past two weeks---posting about the [lack of political bias in PBS and NPR]({% post_url 2025-08-01-week %}#901--tue-29-july-2025) and the [imminent shuttering of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting]({% post_url 2025-08-08-week %}#903--wed-06-august-2025) on Mastodon---I have commented about the war against public media in the United States.  And since I have also written about my experiences with public television in the newsletters, I wanted to collect a bunch of that for (I hope) a quick post that some people might find interesting or useful.

![A press conference and rally in Washington, DC, in 2011, in support of public media](/blog/assets/5557348696_824143e752_o.png "Fourteen years later, and we need to defend it more, not less...")

I won't try to push you to donate to a public media station, but I will tell you about my experience, what I have discovered about the funding, and hope {% emoji crossed fingers %} that it accidentally convinces you.

## Quick Background

For those of you reading this from outside the United States, I should probably quickly describe how public media works in the United States.  In most of the world, "public media" tends to mean "state-run media," where the government funds and oversees production and distribution.

{% cw This doesn't talk about Free Culture, and I didn't bother worrying about licensing with the links, since I'd rather go to the source than try to find somebody who laundered the information for us in a shareable way. %}

By contrast, in the United States, Congress has---for almost the past sixty years---passed money on to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which it divides between administrative expenses (though no more than five percent, by law), investments, production, community outreach, and grants to public television and radio stations.  The local stations generally get their grants in inverse proportion to the money that they can raise from private grants and donors, meaning that it generally goes to rural areas that don't have the population or money to flood the place with cash.

The individual stations then spend their money on exactly what you'd expect, operating costs, production of local programming, licensing popular shows, community outreach, and so forth.  The licensed shows can come from any sources, but often come from other network affiliates---if you watch any public television, then you know [WGBH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGBH-TV) as the producer of nationally popular shows such as **Antiques Roadshow**, **Masterpiece**, **Nova**, and **This Old House**, for example---the BBC, or companies that exist to fill that niche, such as American Public Television or PRX.

Complicated as this system feels, and irritating when the local networks reschedule shows so that they can beg for donations a few times per year, it somehow works out to insulating the various parties, giving the stations editorial independence on show choice, and most shows editorial independence on what they cover and how.  In other words, the government or a corporation has a hard time pressuring public media creators to change their focus, because their money mixed with everybody else's and took so many steps to get there that your local public radio newscast probably has no idea how much of the budget that threat represents, less for the third-party creators.

### Recently

Republicans have never liked this arrangement.  Every year, they have whined about "wasting taxpayer money"---usually something like one percent *of one percent* of the budget, against around thirteen to fourteen percent for the military---but really hating that they can't tell Sesame Workshop to whiten up the neighborhood on **Sesame Street**[^1] or have the **PBS News Hour** stop derailing their talking points in interviews when they directly contradict facts.

[^1]:  OK, yes, the gentrification has actually happened swiftly, as private money from Warner and now Netflix has given the show a more upscale primary audience than the generally poorer families watching a year later on broadcast television.  But you know what I mean, here.

This changed last month, when, after some boring back-and-forth, Republicans used their slim majorities in both chambers of Congress to narrowly [pull two years' worth of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/maga-meter-tracking-donald-trumps-2024-promises/promise/1679/cut-off-federal-funding-for-npr/article/3212/), causing the CPB to [announce its closure](https://cpb.org/pressroom/Corporation-Public-Broadcasting-Addresses-Operations-Following-Loss-Federal-Funding), effectively at the end of September, and then fully early next year.

Note that this doesn't give any more control to the government.  Rather, it imperils the stations that many Republican voters rely on for emergency alerts, if nothing else.

Got it?  OK, that leads me to (an adaptation) of what I wrote for the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) back in January.

## An Ode to U.S. Public Television

Starting early this year, I have spent an increasing amount of my time watching PBS.  You could try thinking of this as an also-ran replacement for the assorted streaming services that I have cancelled[^2].  But in a lot of ways, it feels like a massive upgrade.  And I fell into it, rather than deliberately trying to fill time.

[^2]:  As shows have gotten canceled, or I lost interest in them, I have dropped everything except Peacock, and only have that because an unrelated subscription pays for it as an enticement to keep me as a customer.

### Some History, Mostly Personal

Rather than using PBS as a crutch for paid television, I should say that maintaining fewer subscriptions has given me the opportunity to get *back* into public television.  I grew up on my local channels, as you might imagine, and used to half-joke that Fred Rogers (**Mr. Rogers Neighborhood**) and Graham Kerr (**The Galloping Gourmet**) raised me at least as much as my parents did.  Later, because households generally only had one television back then, and my parents didn't have my tastes, I generally didn't but wanted to watch shows like **Nova**.  And I had an awareness of their big production shows, like **Masterpiece Theater** and **Great Performances**, but ignored them---not that my parents would've gotten into the artsy shows, either---as outside my self-image as "a science person."

Meanwhile, during the 1990s, various companies tried to replace public television on cable with their own private, ad-supported channels.  The Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, Bravo, A&E, Food Network, Home & Garden Television, The History Channel, and many more sprung up trying to pull eyeballs away from PBS.  And they had *some* success, but market forces---to wit, the people who show up to watch an opera, want a deep dive into hydroelectric engineering, or want gardening tips don't pay much attention to commercials, but those shows cost a lot to produce---each of those channels shifted to cheaper shows for a less-critical audience, to the point where you now see the schedules of almost each of those former "highbrow entertainment" channels packed with mean-spirited reality shows or conspiracy theory nonsense.  It costs far less to produce them, and they attract a more credulous audience.

For a while, we felt spoiled for choice in the realm of highbrow entertainment, but it didn't last long at all.  And I think that resulted in a lot of people, myself included, largely forgetting about public television except when some weirdo politician demands that we stop funding it, because it scares them that an outlet has no editorial need to bend to the will of advertisers or a political party.

Since then, I have returned to PBS to watch **America's Test Kitchen** and (with a bit less satisfaction) **Cook's Country** regularly.  I've watched them since their first season in 2001 and, while I don't love all their segments---the newer "gadget" bits, as distinct from the equipment tests or their "gear" show on YouTube, feel especially useless, telling me which of a thing that I should buy without telling me why I would want one or how to judge them---and I feel like their tastes have become more child-oriented (avoiding anything bitter, say) and sometimes a bit reactionary (they cook *way* too much beef, a space where every recipe looks identical to me, then try to make vegetarian dishes "meatier"), but on the whole, the shows do a great job of introducing new ideas and ingredients.

Likewise, if I want "noise in the background," rather than watching television as such, I'll often put on a concert in the background, especially if I saw it featured after watching a cooking show.  That has introduced me to an odd blend of musicians on shows like **Austin City Limits** who I never would've considered listening to otherwise[^3].  And yeah, I've also heard a bunch of acts who I'll never listen to again.

[^3]:  In addition to the assorted acts who fit exactly the sorts of music that you would expect me to listen to, such as The War and Treaty or the Black Pumas, it turns out that I really enjoyed folks like Gracie Abrams and Carín León.  I'd call that worth enduring the occasional "almost certainly right-wing propaganda" show.

### Back to the Point

Anyway, until that return a few years back, I ended up not thinking about PBS much for a long time.  And once I had to juggle a bunch of streaming apps, I didn't have *time* to see what they had to offer.  I might have tried an episode of the **Sanditon** adaptation before they pulled it behind their paywall, but otherwise needed to get my money's worth out of the other services to justify paying for them[^4]...

[^4]:  In fact, realizing that I "looked for things to watch" in services, so that I could justify spending the money on the services, led to a lot of my cancellations, by the way.  If I felt an obligation to watch a *Star Wars* thing because, otherwise, my Disney+ subscription would completely go to waste, then why spend that money in the first place?

However, after watching one of the cooking shows, the PBS app recommended **Becoming bell hooks**, and I couldn't rightly refuse that offer.  While watching it, apart from my thoughts about the work that hooks did, it started to dawn on me that I'd rather watch this sort of material, and that increasingly, on the library apps, I already found myself leaning more heavily on shows from PBS or the BBC, often both via the aforementioned **Masterpiece**.  That led me to other concerts.

The concerts then had recommendations for productions of musicals, at which point I realized that I could have watched concerts, plays, and operas instead of slogging through phoned-in installments of the MCU and *Star Wars* franchises; even *Star Trek* started feeling too much like a responsibility, where I mostly rolled my eyes through three seasons of **Picard**, five seasons of **Lower Decks**, and two seasons of **Strange New Worlds**.  Instead, I could finally become a **Nova** viewer, or catch their quirky independent films, or catch dramas there rather than spending abstract credits on them on the library apps, if I catch them at the right time.  I don't watch much TV news, but **The PBS News Hour** stacks up well in comparison to other outlets, given that it doesn't need to care about commercials or ratings, not perfect, but willing to challenge lying guests.

Note that I don't have any issue with so-called low-brow and middle-brow material, and will almost certainly continue to enjoy such things, as evidenced by how much of it that I've watched over the last few years while insisting that I'd definitely cut back *this* time.  But also, I like a lot of this better.

And sure, public television has material that I'd rather ignore, too.  They'll probably never make me care about people selling junk from their attics, the famous ancestry of celebrities, or multipart history documentaries of eras that everybody already talks about constantly, nor will they sell me on conservative country-rock.  But something similar holds true for any service or channel, increasingly so, now that the economics have turned against them, too.  I can't check in on any service without it suggesting that, because I watched *literally anything*, I'll probably enjoy mean-spirited reality television or (increasingly) live sports coverage, presumably based on the traditional Superman-to-Real-Housewife pipeline or whatever.

### Afterward

After a few months of watching PBS without paying, I started to hit the end of most non-paywall shows that I wanted to check out.  Having enjoyed them, and because Republicans made it clear that, once again, they wanted to stamp out the scourge of *awareness* that faces this country by any means necessary, I donated for the year and started making my way through their back-catalog.  Therefore, I now have what feels like an unlimited supply of British mystery shows, science and history documentaries, and shows about art.

I certainly wouldn't call it perfect.  Among their fiction, I wish that they had more diversity than the occasional non-white supporting role or gay guest-character.  But I feel like I wish that about every entertainment outlet, where they'll also *hide* their more diverse shows, then cancel them because nobody watched...and then they publicize the show after the viewership can't do it any good.

## Back to the News

Since I mentioned **The PBS News Hour**, that brings me to one of the articles that I mentioned at the start of the post.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114936648546911733) [PBS and NPR are generally unbiased, independent of government propaganda and provide key benefits to US democracy](https://theconversation.com/pbs-and-npr-are-generally-unbiased-independent-of-government-propaganda-and-provide-key-benefits-to-us-democracy-261512) from The Conversation

> Public broadcasting in the U.S. works in almost exactly the opposite way: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a private nonprofit with a statutory “firewall” that forbids political interference.

At the time, I mentioned that I find NPR too corporate-style for my tastes, with a weird preference for "some say" stories that always somehow end up normalizing right-wing views.  And I pointed out that, when I watch television news at all, I trust **The PBS News Hour** over the alternatives.

I continued, reiterating some of the points that I made above.

> And, as long as I feel like shilling for PBS, beyond news, they almost literally have something for everyone.  If you want low-budget reality programming, how-to, science, arts, culture, drama, mystery, cozy "comfort food" shows, or plenty of other types of show, they probably have something that you'll enjoy.  And if you donate enough that you can choose the gift[^5] of Passport, you get *decades* more material to watch.
>
> Seriously, in the past two months, about one month into a year of my Passport gift, I have watched the films from an Afrofuturism festival, a bunch of Broadway shows, operas, ballets, a show about world mythologies, a documentary series about Asian Americans, dramatizations of entertainers and politicians, a show about World War II from the perspective of ordinary people in its way, a weird thing about wisdom in America, concerts in genres from country to jazz to show-tunes, the news, cooking shows, detective shows, popular science shows, and probably more that I have forgotten.  You can get the details in the [blog's newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), going out over the next few days.  Did I enjoy all of it?  No, like any streaming service, it has some hits and some misses.  And even the shows that I don't like, I usually at least find interesting.
>
> In fact, calling back to something that I said in my [cord-cutting]({% post_url 2021-04-04-cord-cut %}) over four years ago, I have ended up dropping all the streaming services that I pay for, because I didn't find them worth the *time*, let alone the rising costs.  I now almost exclusively use PBS as the sole service that I pay for, library-sponsored services Hoopla and Kanopy, Peacock because it comes free from something else that I subscribe to, and occasionally dip into the ad-supported services.  And I believe that doing so has improved my mood, because I no longer need to "find something to watch" to justify having paid for Disney+.  Eventually, I may subscribe for an occasional month of something to catch up, but I said that about Netflix a couple of years ago and never bothered.

[^5]:  Public television can't *sell* you anything, so you can't "subscribe" to their streaming service.  Instead, you donate and, at different tiers---and for some rewards, different times---they will send you a gift of your choosing.  Five bucks per month gives you access to their back-catalog to thank you for your support, in other words, not because you exchanged money for a premium streaming service...

Oh, to the shows that I have enjoyed, add an extremely liberal Italian adaptation of a nineteenth-century French novel that itself adapts the story of the world's first department store.  I hit the mid-point of the second season, so I only have...a *thousand episodes* left?  I'll have to see how that goes, I guess, but when I said that you'll find something interesting, I meant it.  Seriously, the freely available material hooked me and, now comparing from the "gift" tier, it almost bothers me how many years I probably had three to five streaming subscriptions, each significantly more than a PBS donation, and got far less enjoyment out of the deal.

Also, though, note the topic of the article that kicked off that mini-rant from me.  It talks about the *lack of bias* found in and the *trust* earned by public media in the United States, at a time when politicians and the mainstream media use "wedge issues" to make it feel like Americans can't agree on anything[^6].

[^6]:  Not relevant to the post, and I can't find the thing, but I listened to a podcast not long ago that actually sent a chill down my spine.  In an interview with a behind-the-scenes journalist type at a major outlet, they asked about how they interpreted the results of some of the outlet's then-recent online polling.  And buried in the answer, this journalist mentioned in passing---and the interviewer didn't give it a thought---that they always try to tweak the questions to get as close to a fifty-fifty split in responses as possible, because "those seem more interesting."  Put that in contrast to how, whenever a big think-tank runs polls on broad issues, something like three-quarters of the country to everybody mostly agrees on everything from welfare to abortion to war, how much of the country's polarization exists because that "seems like a more interesting story," and so corporate journalism manufactured it?

They (and we) see that as reason to protect public media.  But like I said early in the post, Republicans see unbiased reporting and trust as *bugs* in the system, not features.  Hence, [Kari Lake poisoning Voice of America](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/07/usagm-oan-voice-of-america) with One America News propaganda while slashing its staff that might have produced more credible reporting.

## Meanwhile

And that also brings me to the other issue, here.  Like I said, due to the complex nature of public media's funding in the United States, no amount of budgetary trickery or bullying can give the White House or Congress editorial control over the shows.  At most, they can only starve rural stations of funding, forcing them to close, and leaving the locals at the mercy of flaky Internet connections---Trump's FCC has rolled back regulations on broadband, incidentally, so don't expect that to get any better for a while---and abusive social media sites.

And that brings us to this, which came out last week and I posted late this week.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114981963293966451) [Taking the Ax to Public Broadcasting](https://buttondown.com/KeepingScOR/archive/taking-the-ax-to-public-broadcasting-keeping-scor/) from Keeping ScOR

 > For member stations it’s a different story, and the smaller and more rural the station, the more painful the hit. Some in isolated places get nearly all their funding from the CPB.

Where I reacted to posting the first article with the above soft-sell on donating to your local PBS affiliate based on how much I have enjoyed [Passport](https://www.pbs.org/explore/passport/), this time through, I took a more direct approach.

> Like I did, you *will* find programming that you enjoy more than you do on your other streaming services or actual television, unless you primarily watch sports.  Take a few hours among their free offerings to find a couple of those shows, to validate my theory.  Then, rather than donate to your local station like I did, go [pick a station in need](https://adoptastation.org/) and donate to them, instead.  At the moment, it looks like Tennessee's WLJT television station will need to run on half of its normal budget, for example, as opposed to my nearby suburban television-and-radio station (WLIW) that will undoubtedly soldier on with ninety percent of its normal revenue.
>
> Because someone will complain about paying for yet another service---and like I said last week, *technically* you donate to them, and they gift you access, because they can't sell things---a quick search turns up that the cheap plan at Netflix costs eighteen bucks per month, Hulu ten, Amazon Prime fifteen, Apple TV+ ten, (HBO)(Max) ten, Disney+ ten, Paramount+ eight, and Peacock eight...plus ESPN+ twelve, but as established, you won't catch many sports on PBS.  By comparison, most PBS stations will ask for five dollars per month for access to Passport.  Nuke your premium Netflix or whatever, and treat yourself to five months of more interesting programming.
>
> If you'd rather support radio shows, you'll find a couple of stations struggling to get by with as little as a projected **one percent** of their normal budgets.  I admittedly don't understand the NPR donation levels and reward structure, because I have less interest in their work, but whatever you donate to a station in that much peril will almost certainly go somewhere useful.  A lot of the endangered public radio stations especially sit in news deserts, remember, meaning that in the event of a disaster, dollars to their only source of local news can often translate directly to getting people out of harm's way.

And really, I put together this post piecing together everything else to make sure that I delivered this message again.  Specifically, the following.

- I turned out to like PBS more than the alternatives for television, and I strongly suspect that you will, too, whether you go in for theater, science, and mysteries like I do, or really dig Henry Louis Gates helping celebrities draw family trees or Lucy Worsley talking British history.
- After you have found what you like, go donate, because even donating to PBS so that they give you an upgrade to Passport status works out far better than all but the cheapest streaming plans like Roku's new "Howdy"...thing.
- However, don't donate to your local station like I did mine, because your local station can probably handle the funding cuts with corporate grants and member donations.  Instead, [find a station](https://adoptastation.org/) that needs your money more.

And like I said, if you prefer NPR and want to donate to one of those stations, I applaud you because they seem to need the money most, but have no idea if that gets you anything useful or how much you need to pony up for that.  I really only listen to a couple of the podcasts and the rare Tiny Desk Concert...

Now, if only we could convince public media to use Free Culture licenses so that people could more easily spread and build on the good stuff.  They already avoid DRM where they can...
