## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Force of Nature

Since last time, over on **Deep Space Nine**, that crew needed to take care of an unsolved murder case from during the Cardassian occupation, in *Necessary Evil*.

Meanwhile, this episode...we'll *talk* about, but not in the way that the writers probably thought.  In fact, remembering that the episode exists had a lot to do with my continuing these posts beyond Gene Roddenberry's overt influence, because it ties up a lot of what we see.

 > **LAFORGE**: Probably because she knows if I catch her, I'm going to kill her.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **DATA**: These incidents are common to cat owners. When you borrowed Spot, you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behavior before getting a cat yourself.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: She won't come when you call her? Data, have you ever considered training this cat?

I wrote---a *lot*---about how these people treat pets in the post for [*Phantasms*]({% post_url 2025-07-03-phantasms %}), and you'll notice that this only reinforces the idea that they treat them as decorations instead of companions.

 > Captain's log, Stardate 47310.2. We're investigating the disappearance of the Medical Transport *Fleming* somewhere in the Hekaras Corridor. Our search is complicated by the unique properties of this particular region of space.

You probably already know this, but the ship almost certainly takes its name from Nobel laureate [Alexander Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming), who among other things discovered penicillin.  [Peggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Fleming) would've gotten a bigger laugh, though.

 > **CRUSHER**: The *Fleming* was carrying a supply of rare biomimetic gel, which is very valuable. Is it possible that the Ferengi might have hijacked it?
 >
 > **RIKER**: I wouldn't put it past them. I think we should prepare for that contingency.

Sigh...

I expect this sort of overt racism from Riker, but Crusher had an entire episode---[*Suspicions*]({% post_url 2025-04-17-suspicions %}), if you need to refresh your memory---establishing that she didn't buy into Ferengi stereotypes.

 > **LAFORGE**: You might say that. This is the flagship. We should be better than everybody else.
 >
 > **DATA**: Then you are trying to outperform the *Intrepid*.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Actually it's more a point of personal pride. These are my engines. And there's nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry. Okay. Computer, how much have the conversion levels increased?

The *Intrepid* last got a mention in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}), but I mostly quote this exchange to indicate La Forge's awkward pettiness.  Data pointed out that this efficiency will have absolutely no effect on the ship, so La Forge literally only cares because somebody else might gain in status.  And he sees the world as a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), so can't bring himself to support a colleague if he could get that status-bump instead.

 > **DATA**: I began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed with environmental enhancement. Next I plan to explore bio-conditioning devices.

This sounds more than a bit like torture, honestly, or I suppose "more torture," given that the poor thing already lives in an environment with no stimulation other than food and a couple of passive toys.  Conditioning either means the Pavlovian approach of connecting a strong stimulus with a weaker one (so that the subject learns to fear or crave something like a sound) or the "operant" approach of direct reward and punishment, both of which come with a lot of anxiety.  And I can only imagine that "environmental enhancement" means blocking the cat from moving, rather than encouraging it.  And "bio-conditioning" sounds like, at best, spraying water to scare the cat, but probably...well, let's get to that next.

 > **DATA**: Geordi. I cannot stun my cat.

He literally talked about "conditioning devices" seconds ago, often designed to---sometimes literally---stun the animals.  Those [pet fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_fence), for example, come with a collar that apply an electric shock when the animal gets too close to the invisible boundary.  In that case, the sales pitch centers on dogs running out into busy streets, where the shock causes far less trauma than a collision with a car.  But that doesn't seem like a serious problem aboard the *Enterprise*, does it?

 > **LAFORGE**: Well, as I recall, she walked around for two months with a piece of tuna in her blouse.

Missed opportunity for the remaining seventeen episodes of this series...

However, his sister does show a far better understanding of how cats operate.  Their sense of smell comes through far more intensely than hearing or vision, and because we haven't bred them for thousands of years to crave positive feedback as we have with dogs, if you must train them, you need to motivate the behavior more in line with what makes you comfortable[^1].

[^1]:  When did this become a blog about pet care?  For the record, I had a cat for slightly shy of twenty years, who died about fifteen years ago.  I never "trained" him, but he'd routinely come get me when something interesting came on television...

 > **PRAK**: Our attack? We were defending ourselves. Do you deny that you are responsible for disabling my vessel?

If you recognize Prak under those prosthetics and without facial hair, it might have something to do with [Lee Arenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Arenberg) playing him, most recognized in recent years as Grumpy the dwarf in **Once Upon a Time**.  We'll see him a couple more times, in other Ferengi roles and a non-Ferengi spot on **Voyager**, plus a Tellarite on **Enterprise** which I doubt that we'll cover.

 > **PICARD**: In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position to your government if you wish, in case you're unable to complete your repairs and you remain stranded.

As usual, Picard can't pass up an opportunity to flaunt his power over an alien in need.

 > **PICARD**: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe access through this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it.

Wait, what?  At the top of the episode, Picard told us that the region of space had strange properties[^2], which sounds like any passage would need to have a natural source.  And yet, the Federation appears to claim that they chopped their way through the weird space with machetes or something.

[^2]:  By the way, why doesn't this tie in with the main plot?  Wouldn't it make sense for the locals to have discovered the warp drive troubles because the weirdness makes their neighborhood more vulnerable to subspace flooding into normal-space?  Or to make the local space an early *result* of warp drive?  Instead, it has even less to do with the episode than the cat does.

 > **DATA**: I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spot lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to my commands.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I don't know about Spot, but it seems to me your training is coming along just fine. Come on, let's go.

We get a nice little double-standard, here, where La Forge means that Data should feel shame for doing Spot's bidding.  But Data does this with everybody.  We see it most prominently during [*In Theory*]({% post_url 2024-04-25-in-theory %}), I think, but also think about how often the show has occasionally implied---even before [*The Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %})---that Data's people-pleasing and "model minority" personality come from the fact that an argument with anybody could escalate to where he loses his freedom or Starfleet disassembles him.

When he pleases his cat, though, his friend makes fun of him for it.

That said, the scene shows how you actually train cats, and why control-freaks do such a terrible job of it.  Cats won't usually follow directions, but they will do whatever looks like the fastest route to getting what they want.  In this case, Data doesn't see Spot as a peer, only a thing to placate so that he can feel entertained by it, and so has accidentally trained the cat to need someone to placate it.

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain, I've heard this theory before. Their research was evaluated by the Federation Science Council a few years ago. Quite frankly, it didn't hold up.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: If you wanted us to review your research, you should have made a request through the Science Council.

If you file the proper paperwork, maybe we can allocate a few minutes in a few years, to look into your planet's impending destruction before completely dismissing the claim as insufficiently documented...

I joke about the hoops that he suggests for people in distress to jump through, but it strongly indicates that, in addition to believing that the Federation has outgrown pettiness, violence, factionalism, and the like---all evidence to the contrary---Picard also believes that they have almost completely "solved science," where any new claims need to go through the bureaucracy before any legitimate scientist will acknowledge them, let alone give them serious consideration.

 > **PICARD**: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listen to your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is the recovery of the *Fleming*. Now I expect you to help us restore our engines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. If you do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to the nearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, even under these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering. Get the core back online.

Notice Picard's condescending tone, here.  He makes the point that he doesn't care about them at all, and only holds off arresting them because he has *orders* to treat foreign intellectuals with respect.  Somebody needed to sit him down and tell him to treat people nicely, and he can't do better than this, even when he needs their help.

 > **LAFORGE**: Warp drive has been around for three centuries. It's a proven technology.

They talk about the transporters as "proven," too, but those things disperse people into nothing, beam them into walls, trap incidental creatures, accidentally create duplicates, and create horrifying monsters who don't even look like an extra Riker, of the instances that we've seen recently.

 > **SEROVA**: That's your response? More research? More delays. I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything different.

She at least has the excuse of not having watched the show...

 > **PICARD**: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor. I'm sorry about your loss, but we need your help now.

Again, it amazes me how openly dismissive they act towards these people.  La Forge acts shocked that they got something right, whereas Picard's body language and tone show that he absolutely does *not* care about some foreigner's loss, except to the extent that the insincere emotional validation gets the guy to help.

 > **DATA**: By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ.

Really?  I mean, that mostly holds true in our world, but them?  They blow things up such as in [*Realm of Fear*]({% post_url 2024-11-28-realm-fear %}), kidnap people such as in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-26-farpoint2 %}), violate privacy such as in [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}), and more, for "experimental" purposes.  Heck, Picard has an entire speech in [*A Matter of Time*]({% post_url 2024-07-11-matter-time %}) about how he needs to act reckless---with a different planet's survival at risk, I might add---to feel alive or whatever.  Granted, I consider them disreputable based on those and other actions, but they seem to think of themselves as highly reputable...

 > **DATA**: Perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial situation.

Yes, blame the scientist warning about a clear danger, rather than everybody dismissing her as the danger unfolded in front of their eyes... {% emoji eyeroll %}

By the way, notice how this episode reflects some conversations in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), such as the titular character referring to Starfleet's preferred contact as "a nobody" who "respectable people invite to symposiums and diplomatic soirées," and instead directed them to someone with less tact and status who actually understood and cared about the situation.  In the same way here, the story presents the crew with two representatives, one polite and subservient, and the other only focused on getting the job done.  And they make the same choice that Ro warned them against.  If Rabal had worn a snappy blazer, they probably would've made him part of the crew...

 > **LAFORGE**: Maybe I was a little threatened. The thought that warp engines might be doing some kind of damage...It's going to take another half an hour for the nacelles to saturate. Will you call me when they're done?

Well, at least somebody has some minimal investment in accurate self-reflection, at least for the moment.  Don't expect it to last.  In fact...

 > **RABAL**: I don't think we can look at space travel the same way anymore. We're going to have to change.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I've been in Starfleet for a long time. We depend on warp drive. I just don't know how easy it's going to be to change.
 >
 > **RABAL**: It won't be easy at all.

Notice, beyond the shallow metaphor, that they nail the assessment.  La Forge, and the rest of them, expect progress to happen without any effort, and don't see how progress can happen if they need to actually put in the work.  Especially right now, this problem affects *those people*, a bunch of weirdos living in the boonies who we'll never see or talk about again, and expecting these spoiled brats to take some responsibility for not making the universe worse goes a step too far.

This goes to what I've said since the beginning about the difference between the original series and this one.  Kirk and his crew had their problems, but they always acknowledged that they lived in a world in transition, and needed to fight every day to become the better people who they wanted to see in the galaxy.  By contrast, Picard and his crew believe that they inherited a paradise and pure hearts, so every revelation of injustice feels like a personal attack.  They want moral surety, and blame the messengers for, in effect, harshing their mellow.

And I know, it seems absurd to even imagine a philosophical force so dominant, in what looks superficially like a liberal democracy, that people would rather [dismiss experts](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/20/nx-s1-5474320/trump-epa-scientific-research-zeldin) and [ignore the consequences of their own actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill,_baby,_drill) than maybe even consider [behaving responsibly](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/big-beautiful-bill-ban-state-ai-regulations-environmental-energy-climate/) for a while.  No real society could ever act with so little foresight, so they look really silly up on the screen...

 > **RIKER**: Data, what if we forced an EPS discharge through the impulse reactor. Would that be enough to get us out of here?
 >
 > **DATA**: I do not believe so, sir, and the resulting explosion would likely destroy the saucer section in the process.

I feel like Riker should have known that setting off a bomb powerful enough to propel them would also damage the ship.  On the other hand, we've all seen his approach to preparation, so maybe he doesn't actually know about such things.

 > **RIKER**: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many more jolts like that.

Oh, *now* he cares about protecting the ship, wanting to write a strongly worded letter to the rift.

 > Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have been continuing our research, while the Federation Council studies our preliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain that what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come.

Remember that log as we go forward in the franchise, *repercussions for many years to come*...

 > **RABAL**: Based on current warp drive patterns in the sector, we've projected where subspace rifts will be most likely to be formed over the next forty years. This is the way things are now. This is how they'll look in ten years. Twenty years. Thirty years. Forty years.

Searching around, I should note that ten years looks like it'd bump up against the first season of **Lower Decks** and a couple of years after the end of **Voyager**, I gather.  Twenty would take us a couple of years past Spock going missing in the this-universe parts of 2009's **Star Trek**.  Thirty years would take us to the middle of **Picard**.  It makes you wonder if they magically solved the problem off-screen, avoid planets where "space-level rise" has made it more difficult to travel safely so that we (in the audience) don't need to think about the crew's complicity, or decided that they'd rather risk destroying interstellar contact than change their behavior.

Granted, I think that we all know the answer, purely based on comparison with what we see in our world, but you'd think that the franchise would want to at least say *something* about the situation in the intervening years, even if only to officially dismiss the concern to not offend the viewers who believe that windmills have undertaken a [secret campaign to murder us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_syndrome) all or whatever.

 > **PICARD**: Ah. We've received new directives from the Federation Council on this matter. Until we can find a way to counteract the warp field effect, the Council feels our best course is to slow the damage as much as possible. Therefore, areas of space found susceptible to warp fields will be restricted to essential travel only, and effective immediately all Federation vessels will be limited to a speed of warp five, except in cases of extreme emergency.

The allegory, here, seems to want to shift a bit.  While the rest of this episode absolutely wants to make this a climate change conversation---years before we'd generally hear the term outside niche discussions, by the way, at least in the United States at the time, to the episode's credit---our biggest exposure to [speed limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Maximum_Speed_Law) happened as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, as in conserving gas to keep fuel costs down.

And sure, reducing speed means less gasoline burned, which means less output from the engine going into the atmosphere, so *technically* it matches up.  But emotionally, it feels like those belong to completely separate metaphors.  After all, "let's do slightly less damage to space," based on an arbitrary rule from people who didn't even believe this could happen twenty minutes ago, probably won't actually solve this problem, and making it seem like the price of antimatter spiked feels wrong.

More directly interesting, though, note Picard's expression, here, showing more grief at a mild speed limit in *some* neighborhoods than he did over somebody's---actually anybody's, as we go back through the series---death.  He shows more empathy towards the pursuit of drag racing than he does to any person.

Oh, and speaking of that, notice the massive qualification in Starfleet's order, "except in cases of extreme emergency."  Who judges what qualifies as an extreme emergency?  Does Starfleet have a [qualified immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity) kind of scenario, where a planetary government facing down an ecological disaster needs to bring charges against Picard for speeding, where he gets on the stand to say that he totally thought that picking up his space-pizza before it got cold felt like an extreme emergency at the time, and so the judge dismisses the charges because he can't think of a clear reason for Picard to lie?

 > **WORF**: The Klingons will observe these restrictions, but the Romulans will not.
 >
 > **TROI**: And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians, for that matter?

Again, with the "we can act morally, but those weirdos who act exactly like us probably can't" nonsense, as if the Ferengi will destroy their entire civilization (and profit) out of spite.

By the way, this gets a lot further into speculation (and world-building, I guess) than I normally feel comfortable with in these posts, but it occurs to me that this episode might provide new perspective on [*The Price*]({% post_url 2023-06-22-price %}) and [*New Ground*]({% post_url 2024-07-18-new-ground %}), even [*A Matter of Perspective*]({% post_url 2023-08-03-matter-perspective %}), and in turn they might shade some of what we hear in this episode.  For example, the first two episodes focused on the Federation's drive to acquire a new way to travel, one of which would require a massive energy source, which the last episode on the list would have provided.  Did the Federation already confirm Serova's theories and cover it up for a strategic advantage against those rival powers who they now assume lack enough interest in self-preservation to slow down?  Remember, we actually do have some evidence of the Federation covering up threats in [*One of Our Planets Is Missing*]({% post_url 2021-09-02-missing %}) and [**The Motion Picture**]({% post_url 2022-03-10-tmp %})'s adaptation that Starfleet, concealing the occasional emergency from the public to prevent a panic, though those particular incidents belong to another century.

Similarly, a lot like the *New Ground* disaster, from a certain perspective, this revelation looks like the proof of concept for a devastating weapon.  This episode has now made it possible to blockade an area of space and/or put nearby planets in danger with an overloaded engine.  We never see them try, but given the paranoia seen about the Romulans throughout the series, and given their apparent size, it almost seems difficult to believe that the Federation wouldn't have tried to create rifts to seal them in their solar system for at least a few centuries.

 > **PICARD**: The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capable species. We can only hope that they realize it's in their own interests and take similar action.

Do treaties no longer exist?  I'd bet that the Romulans, for example, would take the suggestion far more seriously if the Federation offered to not blame them for every bad thing that happens, or to pool resources to find a long-term solution, or even maybe offer to help feed their people.  But I guess that every government will do this on their own, instead, and not worry about the literal fabric of spacetime.

 > **RABAL**: The gravitational shifts have already begun to affect my planet's orbit. Our climate is changing.
 >
 > **PICARD**: The Federation is setting up a weather control matrix on Hekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice for now.

Ignoring that the story somehow ran out of metaphor, here, jumping from a pseudoscience problem that provides a climate change-shaped problem for the cast to grapple with to literal climate change, we probably want to notice a couple of things.

Most immediately, a changing orbit doesn't sound like a problem that you fix (only) by controlling the weather.  Yes, the planet's climate *will* change, but depending on the structure of their solar system, they might now need to worry about asteroid impacts---in our solar system, Jupiter attracts a lot of junk that could otherwise hit us---and destabilize other planets.  It'll probably change tides, and so likely strip off some atmosphere.  And given that this involves ruptures in spacetime, it doesn't strike me as all that likely that this orbital change happened non-violently...

Related, we've heard about this version of the Federation controlling the weather before, most prominently in [*The Mind's Eye*]({% post_url 2024-04-18-mind-s-eye %}), and this now raises questions about the reasons for that technology, beyond "the future."  Have so many planets destroyed their climates that they now consider this sort of technology unremarkable?

Finally, note Picard's tone, here, especially.  He doesn't see his responsibility as stretching any further than buying time for somebody else to dream up a permanent solution that doesn't ask privileged people to sacrifice any conveniences.  He (vaguely) regrets the pain caused, but some egghead will probably innovate the rest of the galaxy out of the crisis before it affects anybody *important*...

 > **RIKER**: We're lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet as it did. It gives us some time to consider our options.

What a creep...

 > **PICARD**: Very well. You know, Geordi, I spent the better part of my life exploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of new species. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves. Now it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thing that I hold most dear.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: It won't turn out that way, Captain. We still have time to make it better.

And as Picard feels the tiniest twinge of guilt for his part in this galactic crisis, La Forge pushes him (and us) right back onto the wait-for-somebody-else-to-solve-the-problem-with-better-technology track.

## Assorted Quick Commentary

Not under a Free Culture license, so I won't go into depth on anything (of anybody else's) here, but I'd encourage you to read "friend of the blog" [Mup's post on this episode](https://gius.uk/trek/ForceOfNature/).  I don't really do anything like it in this post, since the allegory doesn't matter to our ongoing project, but he more thoroughly draws the necessary analogy on climate change and why the episode does *almost exactly* the wrong thing at every step, assuming that the writers cared about the issue.  (Note:  Coarser language than you'll find here, but a remarkably similar lack of patience for Riker that I applaud.)

As I replied to that post---when originally made on Cohost, by the way---when **Enterprise** tanked and (as far as we'd know for four more years) seemed to take the rest of the franchise with it, a handful of writers posted their rejected pitches for a new show on their websites.  I can't find any of them remaining online, but one wanted to re-envision the original series as a serialized thriller, I believe (which I'd love to see), and two of them, getting to the point, here, would have taken place in a Federation fractured into small "islands" between the expanding rifts.  Working with an experimental or irreproducible "eco-friendly" warp engine, the new crew would handle the most dire emergencies as the climate of space itself turned increasingly dangerous.

Given that the plot of this episode obnoxiously goes pretty much nowhere from here, I often think about how many opportunities to deal with this massive hole in "the canon" that the franchise has thrown away.  Especially given the echoes in the "surfing" idea here, and Riker's plan of trying to [push the ship with explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion), for example, I need to wonder if somebody on the writing staff intended to connect this to *New Ground* and its soliton warp-waves, but we never hear about that again, either.  Likewise, as I mentioned earlier, *The Price* and (in parallel) **DS9** provide the possible option of using wormholes to tool around the galaxy.  Later, **Discovery** (or rather, its spore-drive) seems like the writers designed the fictional technology to engage with this idea, but they never go anywhere near it.  That show *does*, however, jump to a far-future ravaged by "the Burn," which seems like it directly takes that collapsed-Federation idea, but then drops the ball by coming up with an entirely unrelated way for that to happen, which made far less sense[^3].

[^3]:  Part of me thinks that **Discovery** actually had several different ideas of how to explain "the Burn" over the course of that season, possibly failing to communicate them consistently with writers.  I've probably mentioned elsewhere, but it felt like the show kept gesturing in a direction, only to suddenly forget about it in a couple of episodes and try on something else.  Initially, especially given the term's similarity to lead character Burnham's name, it seemed like they wanted to make it a result of *Discovery*'s trip to the future.  Then, it looked like they wanted to engage with this episode as they'd later do with [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}).  After a couple of other ideas, they somehow settled on teen angst to resolve it with a hug, a bizarre choice from a show that came out of the gate openly satirizing the MAGA movement.

Anyway, those two proposals, given their similarity, make me think that Paramount may have solicited ideas that included dealing with this episode, and never had the franchise success and political will together at the same time to go through with it.

In the main post, I question whether those episodes might indicate that the Federation has started planning for the disaster---equivalent (to follow the allegory through) to [billionaires having bunkers constructed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/bunkers-billionaires-survive-apocalypse-cost-features-1235822762/) or trying to colonize Mars with company towns instead of putting that money into getting solar panels on every roof and electric cars in every driveway---but even if they don't, it still seems wild to me that the franchise tries *so* hard to present this idea before it became a mainstream conversation[^4], only to shrug its shoulders and grumble about the equivalent of eco-terrorism inconveniencing their military action instead.

[^4]:  You get into some weasely spaces, when talking about the timing of the climate justice movement, to my chagrin.  All environmentalism has gotten retroactively claimed by climate activists as "theirs," no matter what it aimed for, and the date of founding of the Climate Action Network fluctuates depending on who you ask.  But when this episode aired, COP1 sat two years in the future, and the ink on the [UNFCCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) still felt a bit damp.  The conversation existed, in other words, but conversations about global environmentalism focused on [ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion) at the time, and this episode probably introduced a lot of us to the topic of climate change.

## Conclusions

We get some history, but this episode packs itself with culture, none of it good...

### The Bad

We continue to see terrible treatment of pets, treating them somewhere between disposable and servants.  They don't seem to care at all for empathizing with their pets, even when it comes to changing their behavior.

The crew also jumps to racist stereotypes a couple more times, supposing that dirty foreigners surely caused any problems that they've heard about and will probably refuse to cooperate in saving the same environment that they need for survival.  Picard, likewise, goes out of his way to show that he has power over a foreigner in need.  We even see this in the treatment of Data, where they appreciate his people-pleasing personality, but laugh at him when he extends it to help somebody who they don't respect.

People also continue to obsess about status and petty jockeying for dominance.  This may extend internationally, with the Federation taking credit for "establishing" natural features, and seeming to dismiss the idea of multilateral projects entirely.  And Picard continues his plays for dominance over any non-humans who cross his path.

Maybe related, we see a lot of respectability politics, here, with a clear distinction drawn between the scientist who needs everybody else to understand the stakes and her colleague who doesn't want to offend or inconvenience anybody, and everybody showing a clear preference for the latter.

We also see a strong anti-intellectual streak, in that it takes the entire episode for our crew to even consider the possibility that their technology causes damage to the environment.  They try to put off even thinking about the idea until the bureaucracy has reviewed it and react angrily to the request, only making an exception when an example actively endangers their colleagues.  Even then, they insist that they hear the idea out for reasons of grudging politeness, not open-mindedness.  They have come to trust their technology implicitly, unable to even consider the possibility of side effects.  They also have a huge double-standard when it comes to risk, where they can put people's lives in danger, but everybody else needs to follow proper channels.  Riker also pokes his nose into a conversation to suggest trying to escape by bombarding his own ship, only to turn around and whine when he needs to deal with the effects of a similar situation.

Likewise, we continue to see a complete disinterest in dealing with grief.  One lost life and the precarious lives of an entire civilization barely warrant a mention, let alone time to think about the loss, because Picard wants the crew to move faster.

Going further, they also all openly rankle at the slightest idea that slowing down the harm starts with them.  Even Starfleet, in its "solution," narrows the scope of restrictions so narrowly as to feel laughable, and they still all break down in grief about the possibility of taking some care in the future.  They don't even take responsibility for mitigating immediate effects, beyond dropping off some technology to help mask the problem.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Data becomes jealous of his stepmom taking screen-time away from him, in *Inheritance*.
