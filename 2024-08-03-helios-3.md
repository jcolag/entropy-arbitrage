This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads three more stories from **The Aether Age Codex:  Helios** before taking a break on the book.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Aether Age Codex:  Helios

The editors describe the anthology as follows, at the start of their note.

 > Welcome to the first volume of the Aether Age Codex, which we have labeled **Helios**. Discover tales of a humanity given a single prime to the pump of progress as they stare into a sky that in a blink of History has burgeoned into life and mystery. Given the antecedents, is it any wonder that they take flight in airships, balloons, as winged hoplites, and aboard wooden rockets, even as Athenian philosophers argued over the very laws of nature?
 >
 > After careful study of the available materials, we conclude the familiar human drive to learn and to teach is as much responsible for the dramatic divergence of this history from our own, as the wondrous and strange nature of their physical world.
 >
 > During an era when our own civilizations labored in illiteracy and when major technological innovations were separated by centuries, the people of the Aether Age Codex progressed at an astonishing speed. Ideas spread across borders and seas. Science, invention, and industry proceeded at a pace only recently seen in our own world.
 >
 > Despite the spectacular circumstances and drama, these are accounts of people contending with the unknown through bravery, fear, and the entire emotional spectrum. In that sense, these windows into the Aether Age open into a world as familiar as it is unexpected.

I've heard other people describe it more tersely as "[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk), but less [WASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestants)-y."

I should note that, starting with the **Helios** posts, the Book Club plans to at least bend one of my guidelines for these posts, for I think justifiable reasons.  Normally, I try to avoid going back to the same source and involvement by the same creator, at least until we have exhausted the available authors; I want to spread the attention, not keep reminding you of the same handful of people.

However, Brandon H. Bell edited this anthology---along with Christopher Fletcher---and also edited a Free Culture anthology *periodical* at around the same time.  As such, to spread attention to more people, expect to see Bell's name come up disproportionately, as we talk about the short stories in *that* anthology at some point.

As another note, it appears that supplemental content for the book has vanished from the Internet, assuming that its creators ever released it.  The editorial remarks mention audio adaptations of some stories, possible dramatizations, and a soundtrack.  Sadly, I can't even find evidence of much of it.  An episode of the long-defunct [Outer Alliance Podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20110823215320/http://outeralliance.podbean.com/2010/12/17/outer-alliance-podcast-2/) included an excerpt of one of the later stories in the book, but I can't find the recording.  Somebody took down the book's trailer video, which apparently included music from the soundtrack.  And maybe that feels appropriate for a book that calls itself a translation of a fragmentary text that arrived from another timeline...

### Technology (and Capitalism) Note

Many of you will feel put off by the fact that you can only get the book, at least for the moment, at Amazon.  I don't blame you, because I had the same twinge when I bought it, ultimately relenting because I needed to buy something else there anyway.  As always, I won't post a copy of the book to get around this, since that would encourage people to avoid supporting the project[^1].  Some good news does exist, however.

[^1]:  I will see if I can find and contact the editors, though.  If the age and discount means that they no longer really care about monitoring sales or the money, then I'll dump my PDF somewhere.

First, a lot like [**Occupy This Novel**]({% post_url 2021-10-23-occupy1 %}), the book has no [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) on it, so once you buy it and navigate through Amazon's user interface maze to download it, you can convert the book to something sensible, like the PDF that I read from.

Second, you can borrow the book through the Internet Archive, if you absolutely refuse to engage with Amazon or spend the dollar on (so far) a fairly good book and don't know somebody who might share their copy with you.

## What Works Well?

In effect, these stories give us our first bits of "franchise continuity."  Previous stories have had no real relationship to each other, beyond (ostensibly) sharing the same setting, but *The Arms of the World* indicates at least some consequences of *The Birth of Hellas*.

Also, as with prior installments, these stories do have interesting protagonists.  If it seems that I find more faults with the stories than I find aspects to appreciate and carry forward, that might have something to do with how each story definitely has good writing in it, but it often feels like a miser spread it out.  We have great protagonists, and the occasional tightly executed plot, which emphasizes the lapses when the antagonists have no personality, or autonomy or some plots fail to fit together in a meaningful way.

And it took us long enough, but the book *finally* at least begins to pay off the promise that these events involve the entire world, rather than spending all our time with Greeks and Egyptians.  And yes, we technically got a glimpse of the Japanese [last week]({% post_url 2024-07-27-helios-2 %}), but they served more as props than characters, with none of them even getting a name or showing up in person, let alone having speaking roles.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Much as in the [stories from the first post]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %}), these stories choose to engage in an unpleasant amount of Orientalism.  *The Birth of Hellas* starts with a historically reasonable dismissal of the Persians as barbarians, which I can accept given the specific bigotries of the day, but quickly lands on cheering for extermination and colonization, which...I could've done without, personally.  Maybe it comes out of period writings---probably not, given my next comment, but I don't really know---but that wouldn't make it good or interesting storytelling.

Similarly and maybe related, *The Birth of Hellas* and *The Arms of the World* both do a lot of what I praised the earlier stories for avoiding, giving us modern cultural references and assuming that we readers can fill in the blanks that the author apparently didn't bother to research.  While early stories took great care to use the relevant Greek terms for the relevant celestial bodies, these stories seem to consider that too much effort, and so talk casually about the Earth, Sun, and Moon.  I'd also question whether "Persian" (which I cite above) makes any sense in this context.  I call this potentially related, because in retrospect, it doesn't surprise me that a story applauding prospective genocide might also see period-appropriate cultural research of foreign cultures as pointless.

And unfortunately, we get the rather predictable flip-side of visiting part of the world beyond Classical Greece's world:  A story about human sacrifice.  And look, yes, we do have *some* evidence of [human sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_pre-Columbian_cultures), but we have never had evidence of such sacrifices occurring regularly or as some sort of incitement to war, and many victims seem drawn from prisoners of war, rather than children.  By contrast, [child sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sacrifice) appears to have happened in the Americas either in large groups or out of desperation in climatological emergencies...and if you read the latter Wikipedia article, you'll note that Ancient Greece seems to have sacrificed *its* share of children to nature gods, as well, so it feels particularly lurid and exploitative to focus on it "over there," with nobody ever mentioning that detail in the stories centering on the Hellenes...

## Opportunities

I sincerely doubt it, other than buying the book from Amazon.  They published the book almost fifteen years ago and never---to my knowledge, but please somebody correct me, here---tried to build a community around the concept.

## What's Adaptable?

The Aegean League seems new, though may also refer to an expanded version of the [Nesiotic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_the_Islanders).  Likewise, we have the (Lunar/Selenite) colony of Paarsa.

Maybe slightly more interestingly, I may have overlooked a reference somewhere obscure, the last story in the batch indicates an apparent fictional Olmec pantheon, with Hoshopi, Senuaccha, Mayapolu, the first of which, they identify as the god of the mountains.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll put aside aether age antics---but will probably return to them at some point in the future, like a few of the longer books---and watch **Viaje a la Tierra del Quebracho**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about these stories?
