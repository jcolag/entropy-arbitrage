In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Sub Rosa

Since last time around, the **DS9** crew try to help Bashir and O'Brien---remember him...?---from afar while they live a relatively slow-paced thriller about biological weapons, in *Armageddon Game*.

Meanwhile, as far as I know, everybody hates this episode, and people still make fun of it.  I haven't watched it since it aired, I believe, and as I steel myself for yet another hour with this crew---these introductions do generally get written before anything else---I can't help making bets with myself about *why* it flopped.  Does it have terrible writing?  Does the sexual nature make fans uncomfortable?  Or does it have the nerve to center the sexuality of a middle-aged woman and not treat it as completely laughable or something to fear?  With this show, it could land on any of those...

 > **CRUSHER**: Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy body. Her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal teas, and often they were just as bitter tasting. I will miss Felisa Howard very much. Her healing, her advice, and most of all, the inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace, Nana.

We heard about Crusher's healer-grandmother way back in [*The Arsenal of Freedom*]({% post_url 2022-10-06-arsenal-freedom %}), largely inspiring her choice of career in bad times.

By the way, you might note the characterization of the medical field, here, as implicitly not really caring about patients beyond "wellbeing" metrics.  Uniquely, I guess, Dr. Howard might advise a lifestyle change while offering herbal remedies.

That ties in directly with one of the recurring threads that we've needed to talk about in these posts, the New Age influence on the show.  Since laundered through what we now call [conspirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspirituality) and now {% emoji eyeroll %} [Make America Healthy Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Healthy_Again), the era found people insisting in hushed tones that "they" have withheld household remedies for all manner of illnesses from us.

And that, in turn, gets to at least some of the politics that we see the characters espouse.  I haven't yet, but I often consider writing a Sunday post about my own experiences in the New Age world, with the working title *Come for the Crystals, Stay for the Racism*, because that space often moved quickly from "white magic" and misappropriating "Eastern medicine" to Area 51 conspiracy theories, and from there to Earth caught in a battle between different alien *races*, anchored at either end by the evil lizard people---the discussion of which often borrow directly from anti-Semitic canards---and the altruistic "Nordics"...who coincidentally look like tall Swedish men.

 > **TROI**: That was beautiful.

For this episode, Troi will mostly revert to her early role in the series of complimenting things about the episode.  I have to assume that they did it as an inside joke, after realizing that they needed somebody to mention the critical plot point coming over at the house, and tried to camouflage it.

Incidentally, I notice that, in a deleted scene around this point, Crusher casually mentions that she stopped visiting home once she met Jack, moving to Earth with him.  And while I might not otherwise bring up events that "didn't happen" in the official episode, it feels like they might have meant it as foreshadowing or underscoring the main plot, because so many abusive relationships start with isolating the victim from their support system, to create reliance on the worst possible person.

And you might think that this seems unnecesarily hard on Jack Crusher, but think about how, in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}), we find out that Jack proposed to Beverly with a "joke" about marrying him somehow advancing her career, as he ran off leaving his pregnant wife to finish medical school.  In a deleted scene, he also left Wesley a message talking about the Crusher legacy including a Confederate soldier, the Confederacy almost obsessed with the "purity" of women.  On **Picard**, we'll later find out that Picard and Jack went AWOL from the *Stargazer* to patronize sex workers, with no indication of whether this happened before or after he met his future wife.  Now, add to those massive red flags that something about the relationship kept her from contacting anybody from where she grew up, and this sounds shady.

And it sounds doubly shady, when mentioned at the start of an episode seeing Crusher torn between a ghost, who literally wants to separate her from her current support system so that she'll exclusively rely on him as seven hundred years of ancestors have, and a boss who thinks that he can order her around in her personal life.

 > **MATURIN**: Well, as you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are nearly a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship Engineer take a look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal?

Other than a weird aside in the (probably doesn't count) [*Mudd's Angels*]({% post_url 2021-08-05-angels %}) suggesting that the franchise's favorite confidence trickster having private access to the technology that he would then improbably use to scam his victims, and I suppose the Genesis device after that in [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %}) even though they never use the word, we first started talking about terraforming in [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %}) and a couple of other times since, suggesting that it doesn't happen often and may not work produce reliable results.  Given the obsession that the Federation often seems to have with colonizing places and how much experimentation that they could potentially do with enough empty planets, that seems to suggest that they've found so many valuable planets that they don't generally need to make them more valuable, keeping the technology in its infancy.

 > **PICARD**: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressive accomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands.

Well, if the Frenchman says that it feels like Scotland...

 > **MATURIN**: That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here. They didn't want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it.

Wow, that sounds terrible.

No, not because they chose Scotland.  Imagine that you live in the distant future, among a massively pluralistic society, offering almost anything that you can ask for, somewhere.  Imagine further, that you have the opportunity to make a fresh start, drawing from the rich tapestry of thousands of years of myriad cultures.  And you pick part of a political division from some planet that everybody knows about, representing only one to two percent of the planet, and feel so "committed to the bit" that you haul your building materials across the galaxy.

If they had found this planet looking like the northern part of Scotland and people recognized it as similar, I could understand that.  But contrast the size of the galaxy with the size of the Earth, and this looks like founding a city based on your childhood house, every building decorated with the same posters that you enjoyed as a teenager...

 > **PICARD**: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots yourself. What was it that drew you here?

How do they always fail to meet my lowering expectations for kindness.  Do you want to ask him where he *really* comes from, too, Jean-Luc?

Also, he personally knows at least a dozen unrelated people with mixed ancestry.  Maybe Maturin *does* identify as Scots, on some great-grandparent's side, and he doesn't like talking about how the other elements of his heritage came together.  Seriously, don't talk to people like this, ever...

And while we need to talk about this sort of ethnic purity drivel, did they mean this to gesture at one of the driving forces of the occasional (and horrible) Picard-Crusher romance?  I mean, since this entire tedious conversation feels like it exists equally to deliver irrelevant exposition and admit that a Scottish performer plays the French captain, as if we hadn't noticed, does the show (or only Picard) want us to support that coupling because they both have a Scottish heritage?

 > **MATURIN**: Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy, my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I looked out across the highlands, I felt as if I had come home.

You, too, can visit [Glamis Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamis_Castle), apparently.

 > **CRUSHER**: Thanks.

If she finds the blanket useful, I have to wonder if the uniforms have any value at all.  [*In Theory*]({% post_url 2024-04-25-in-theory %}) indirectly told us that the boots don't breathe, and [*Cost of Living*]({% post_url 2024-09-26-cost-living %}) showed pretty much the same about the rest of the uniforms.  If they don't keep you warm or cold in adverse conditions, and we see them constantly adjusting themselves, then why not wear street clothes?  I feel like even I own more technically sophisticated clothing than those uniforms.

 > **MATURIN**: We've been having a few tremors over the past couple of months. Could you check the seismic stabilizers?

Do they have nobody who knows how to do this?  Did it not feel Scottish enough?

 > **PICARD**: It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorous libidos.

Seriously, don't talk to people like this, ever...

 > **PICARD**: Well it looks like we're going to be on Caldos for a few days more. This will be a good opportunity to get your grandmother's affairs in order.

...So to speak.

 > **PICARD**: Thirties?

Yes, we can't skip the part where people find older women's sex lives bizarre-to-disgusting.

 > **TROI**: I'd read two chapters.

Didn't they invent an entire closet for this?

 > **DATA**: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir, but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused an unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony.

You know, if somebody asked me to check on their system that seemed fine but maybe due for repairs, and things got dramatically worse as I examined them, I might wonder if I did something wrong.  Not this crew, though.  They blame a ghost...

 > **RONIN**: Ghosts? Nor did I in the beginning. I was born in sixteen forty-seven, in Glasgow on Earth.

Yes, yes, "a warrior, a lover, a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in a combat to the death."  I liked that show back then, too...

Also, though, I wonder if this episode intended, at some point, to [*Wolf in the Fold*]({% post_url 2020-11-12-wolf %}), specifically its mention of "the Drella of alpha Carinae V," which feeds on love, as a contrast to Redjac feeding on fear...who also seemed to have spent a long time on Earth before following humanity into the galaxy.

 > **RONIN**: I found a home with Jessel Howard. She was a pretty lass with a mane of red hair, and eyes like diamonds. I loved her very much. When she died, I stayed with her daughter, and her daughter, and on down through the years, generation after generation.

Remember though, the show wanted us to find the old woman having a boyfriend creepy.  Grooming dozens of generations of children, nobody even repeats with disbelief.

 > **TROI**: I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you to consider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss. Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of closeness and romance.

She *almost* provided useful insight, there.



 > **DATA**: I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop has formed in the transfer beam. I will have to go to the substation and attempt to correct the problem from there.

Again, maybe the ghost didn't do this...?

 > **CRUSHER**: Ensign, ask Doctor Selar run a biospectral analysis.

Selar still exists, I guess.  We last heard about her in [*Suspicions*]({% post_url 2025-04-17-suspicions %}), though she hasn't made an appearance other than [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}).

 > **PICARD**: Beverly, you can't just resign.

Note that he doesn't ask her not to do it or to reconsider.  He lies, insisting that she doesn't have the ability to do so.

 > **TROI**: Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a very intense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden, but she didn't want to talk about it, so I let her alone. I sensed that she was holding something back, that she wasn't telling me the whole truth.

And she doesn't get paid nearly enough to do more than phone it in on her job, so that seemed like more than enough investment...

 > **PICARD**: Have you changed the color of your eyes?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: I just grew tired of the other color. Don't you think it suits me?

It would seem that, in addition to cosmetic surgery on demand that can make you look like a different clade of humanoid[^1], you can get your eye color changed fairly casually.

[^1]:  The term "species" doesn't work, due to all the aforementioned mixed ancestry that we see.  And "race" doesn't work, because the idea only exists to justify racism.  A [clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade), though, refers to any group of organisms descending from a common ancestor.  Humans?  Clade.  Mammals?  Clade.  Multicellular organisms?  A clade, at least until we find creatures that have a different single-celled ancestor.  A clan, since the term gets a mention in this episode?  Probably a clade.  [Linnean taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy), the seven-to-nine-tiered hierarchical classification scheme of Latin names, has started to dissolve in the face of no longer seeing where one species ends and another begins---ironically, we can probably thank the opposition to teaching evolution for forcing those refinements, as they demanded to see the "missing links" between other apes and modern humans---to leave us with a more flexible system where divisions depend entirely on how far back in history you'd like to check.  All that to say that "clade" feels like the actual correct term for identifying the (fictional) biological groups of people who wear similar prosthetics.  Though I also like ethnicity, which similarly suggests a common ancestry, but can also include culture, language, and other identity markers.

This feels like it raises an inevitable question:  Assuming that these sorts of cosmetic changes don't require misappropriating Starfleet resources, why don't we see them in ways that don't look like high-end [blackface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface)?  I mean, you have to imagine that, in a culture as obsessed with LARPs as we've seen on this show up to and including this episode showing us that people built an entire planet to cosplay living in Scotland, somebody must want to look like some fantasy creature or other.

We don't see them, though, suggesting that either the average person can't access those procedures or society frowns on it.

 > **PICARD**: I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. I think I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly.

Yes, her eye color does have a plot-relevant reason, but as always, notice how controlling Picard sounds, here.  He never expresses that her sudden changes have him worried about a close friend or whatever they call themselves.  He doesn't ask her to help him understand.  Rather, he states a preference, and seems to think that'll "fix" her, because why would anybody want something that he doesn't?

 > **PICARD**: Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out.

Doesn't any permission to exhume Dr. Howard's body need to go through her next of kin, as in Crusher?

 > **LAFORGE**: La Forge to Enterprise. We're ready down here.
 >
 > **CREWMAN**: Aye, sir.

I'll tell you, it takes all the drama out of an emergency exhumation, if they can casually beam out the coffin.

 > **CRUSHER**: No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost. You are some sort of anaphasic lifeform. Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable. It needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else you'll die. Isn't that right?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: I also scanned the candle. The flame is plasma based. You were using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me, in order to merge with me. You have been using me, Nana, my entire family for centuries.

I kind of like how, whenever Crusher gets the focus of an episode, she always gets a scene at the climax where she puts everything together so that she can take the final step.  You never see the rest of these people thinking things through, or even really solving the problem.

 > **CRUSHER**: I re-read the entries in my grandmother's journals. Whatever else he might have done, he made her very happy.

Sure, he abused, controlled, and arguably enslaved and killed grandma, but while manipulated, she seemed to enjoy it well enough.  But again, they want us to see the hundred-year-old woman with a thirty-year-old love as the weird part.

## Quick Commentary

I don't have much to say, here, but since I brought up the general dislike of this episode at the top, I wanted to follow up.  It seems fine, and I've slogged through *many* less-appealing hours of television with this crew.  If I had to guess, I would say that the distaste mostly had to do with focusing on sex *and* not exploiting it to titillate a target demographic of young heterosexual men.  Either that, or it could come from the episode almost seeming to {% sfx gasp %} condone mature women enjoying sex.

## Conclusions

We get some indication of the scope of cosmetic surgery, of all things.

### The Bad

We don't find out whether they have earned it, but the medical field appears to have a reputation for ignoring wellbeing or non-pharmaceutical treatments.

Picard sees no issues in asking local officials to confirm their legitimacy for him, on the basis of ethnicity.  He also seems to want to provoke conversations with women about their libidos.  And he seems desperate to assert some personal control over Crusher, even lying to manipulate her, instead of treating her as a peer.  Troi, somewhat similarly, has gone back to refusing to do her job beyond spouting some generic advice.  Even when confronted with it, she shrugs off her failure.

We get yet more evidence that the uniforms use nothing more than twentieth-century technology, doing nothing to protect the officers.

Terraformed planets apparently require consistent maintenance to the technology that keeps the biosphere from collapsing, but they don't seem required or interested in hiring somebody who knows how to do it.  Also, despite the system all but collapsing as soon as they touch it, the crew doesn't seem to even acknowledge the possibility that they might have damaged something.

As we've seen many times before, the crew finds female sexuality uncomfortable.  And as the woman ages, it becomes peculiar or repulsive.  And they seem to ignore the mind control to declare that the woman felt happy.

### The Weird

Apparently, they can get permission to dig up cemeteries from the local government, not the next of kin.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we try to pretend that we care about the rest of the crew, in *Lower Decks*.
