As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Saqqara is now an emerging hotspot for archaeologists as recent excavations have uncovered incredible new artifacts, including dozens of 4,500-year-old cat mummies and millions of mummified dogs.

Everybody in the world has already made their xenophobic jokes about curses, so I'll just point out that we may like to imagine that the planet has been completely mapped and there's noplace left hiding, but the reality is that we're both literally and figuratively just scratching the surface.

 > The officer also says that the investigation represents a larger moral battle.

It's an impressive degree of self-deception that lets someone who abetted the violent murder of a sleeping woman insist that they somehow have the moral high ground.

 > But humans have a leg up on fish: access to information and means of virtual communication.

The paper tangentially makes what's probably a more important point that someone should investigate further, that bigotry---which may be instinctual on some level, in times of severe stress---might *worsen* the spread of disease, by offering false heuristics regarding which people to avoid.

In other words, while the paper is more focused on checking in with friends and colleagues on video calls, it seems to indicate that solidarity is a far better strategy for dealing with outbreaks of disease than atomization.

###### Eugenio María de Hostos

It's a shame that there's no easy way to track the spread of ideas, because this self-written epitaph---based on the era it was written---might easily have influenced the introduction to [**The Adventures of Superman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Superman_(radio_series)) and so the lore of the character in general.

One of the inherent problems with the United States Constitution is that it's the first blueprint for a large democratic (little-d, pedants...) country and, as such, was constructed naïvely.  It was also written before there was any thought given to reconciling the racially-motivated abuse and exploitation that made the country wealthy.  So, while not every democratic country has a constitution that represents a step forward, it's worth looking at younger countries to see what they've learned in the centuries since.

This, I think, has been one of the more frustrating parts of the pandemic.  We're always just a few weeks away from stamping it out.  But because we're attached to the illusion of "normalcy," we never get any closer.  One bill to pay each person to stay home (if they can) for three months---making sure there's some wiggle room---and getting masks to every address would solve the problem.  Since this post is published on October second, a hypothetical two month window starting now would end in time for Thanksgiving.

And yet, we won't do it, because the current administration doesn't believe it's a big deal, even as many of them are about to get very sick from that disease.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Tribune Publishing Out-Evils Itself With Phishing Email Promising Bonuses](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3z8g5/tribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses) from VICE Motherboard

 > The email then directed recipients to log in using a provided link to view the bonus and to "be advised that you may deposit all or a portion of your bonus into the company RRSP program." When employees clicked on the link, however, it said "Oops! You clicked on a simulated phishing test!"

To be clear, it's almost never a bad idea to regularly test employees on these issues, because system administrators need to know who to better educate on network security, before they expose the network to a real attacker.  However, it's generally accepted that you give the employees notice that it will be happening and that you not make the setup cruel...
