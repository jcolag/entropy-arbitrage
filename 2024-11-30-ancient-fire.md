To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Ancient Fire

I can't find any formal statement on this book, other than the author stating "I've written...the following books," which includes it.

You might recognize the author's name from his work on the [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) (previously Jabber) communications protocol, or his writings about philosophy that seem to lean heavily on the works of William Shakespeare and Ayn Rand.  That combination of writing topics suggests a certain outlook to me, as many of you might guess, but I don't see any direct evidence of it and don't see any reason to dig for any.  I only raise the possibility, because it'll inevitably color my view of what we find in the poems.

For the translations, you might want to know that the so-called "Tenth Muse" [Sappho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho) lived around 600 BCE and wrote at least ten thousand lines of poetry, known mostly for love poems; people have debated her sexuality for thousands of years, leading to her use as a symbol for homosexual women.  [Quintus Horatius "Horace" Flaccus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace) lived about six hundred years later and wrote poetry on a wide variety of topics, mostly known today for blending light-hearted wording with more serious topics.

You now know everything that I know about the poems.

## What Works Well?

If you like poetry that focuses mainly on wordplay to support its observations, then you'll probably find a lot to enjoy, here.  Poems such *Indivisible* and *The Problem of the One and the Many* feel like they want to call out for an illustrator to turn (perhaps slight adaptations of) them into children's books, for example.

While as usual a lot of this comes down to taste, I can at least appreciate the attempts to try to speak to bigger issues and grapple with wanting to do better.  *Cobalt*, for example, comes precariously close to expressing the poetic equivalent of the criticism that a woman would look prettier if she smiled more, but also realizes that it has gone too far at the end.  Likewise, *Jesus in Atlantis* runs longer than I might like, but it feels like somebody should make it required reading for the many Christians who don't have any interest in anything that their alleged savior actually said, and use the religious persecution of two thousand years ago to justify their victim mentality.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

While I don't dislike the selection, and found some items that I even like, if I had to read this again, I'd strongly recommend mostly skipping the translations.  Thinking of this as a professional---whatever that might mean---book of poetry, it might make sense for an unproven poet to establish their ability by bringing somebody else's words into the modern world.  But it overwhelms the reason that we probably got here, and depleted my [thinking-about-the-Roman-Empire](https://theconversation.com/how-often-do-you-think-about-the-roman-empire-tiktok-trend-exposed-the-way-we-gender-history-214425) quota[^1] for at least the next year...

[^1]:  To answer the question, I don't think about the Roman Empire at all, except when recognizing that some media has made a reference to something from the era---which probably shouldn't count---and when Empire-obsessed right-wing weirdos try to argue that certain people don't deserve citizenship, since the Empire fell (in part) because it "outsourced" a lot of work (like defense) to conquered groups but wouldn't give them citizenship, with entirely predictable results...

And while I can appreciate the word-play in many of these, quite a few poems seem like little more than attempts at observational comedy.  And while I can't really object to such a thing, those poems feel like they have something missing or withheld.

## Opportunities

I don't think that you'll find any ways to get involved after a decade, though the author seems to have plenty of irons in plenty of fires, so maybe opportunities to get involved exist that I don't see.

## What's Adaptable?

Maybe as usual for poetry, we don't get much, other than a notional narrator who struggles with sexism (*Cobalt*, *On a Visit to the Musée Rodin*) and socializing (*No Exit*), has a complicated relationship with their art (*In the Garden*, *Troubadour*, *Moving Violation*), dislikes maintaining a house (*Ivy, My Enemy*), and would like to retreat to rural areas (*Fond Wish*).

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read **Enkidu**, a "physical theater play," and **Plastic**, "a Libre art dance play," by the same author.  Maybe a third, **2048**, depending on my mood.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the poems?
