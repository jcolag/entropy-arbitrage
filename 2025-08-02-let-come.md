This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to **Let It Come From Whom It May**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Released:  2013
 * License:  CC BY-SA

 * Content Advisories:  Inequality, some images intended to disturb (stillbirth)

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Let It Come From Whom It May

The album's page describes it as follows.

> “We were not born critical of existing society. There was a moment in our lives (or a month, or a year) when certain facts appeared before us, startled us, and then caused us to question beliefs that were strongly fixed in our consciousness — embedded there by years of family prejudices, orthodox schooling, imbibing of newspapers, radio, and television. This would seem to lead to a simple conclusion: that we all have an enormous responsibility to bring to the attention of others information they do not have, which has the potential of causing them to rethink long-held ideas.” >

And it describes the band itself like so.

> Madison WI post-noiserock focusing on dynamics, repetition, and the dismantling of capitalism. Tyranny Is Tyranny is the title of the fourth chapter of Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States."

I should note that, while the genre has proven shockingly popular among many of my friends over the years, I haven't had much interest in metal, myself, so please excuse me---and offer corrections in the comments---if I miss some common trope or motif in the music or lyrics that fans would spot immediately, and I overlooked because I got caught up telling the kids to *get off my lawn and stop playing that noise so loud*.  Err...{% emoji rock on %}?

## What Works Well?

They seem to have their hearts in the right place, pro-labor and opposed to exploitation.

And yes, this comes down to personal taste, but when they have their melodic segments, I do get a sense of the craft at work.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The lyrics seem awfully...sparse.  I mean, over the course of forty minutes, the band delivers three hundred twenty-four words, though I suppose that they echo some of it.  Almost seven and a half seconds per word makes this entire exercise (of this post, I mean) feel a bit silly.

Some of this feels opaque to me.  Presumably it doesn't matter, as the shortest song on the album, and doesn't even get forty words to make its case, but I have no idea what they mean by "k-hole" or what something (someone?) going down it means.  Do they mean [ketamine intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole)?  Maybe, but what few lyrics we get don't sound like they want to refer to that.

## Opportunities

You can buy the album and others at the Bandcamp link, and presumably leave a kind comment, but I don't see much interaction or any activity in about a decade.

## What's Adaptable?

I didn't catch anything specific, though I suppose as a whole, the songs vaguely describe some Midwestern working-class life.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll play the fairly recent **Little Dig Game**, a short browser game.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
