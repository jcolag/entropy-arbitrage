![The April 2024 solar eclipse from the Indianapolis Speedway](/blog/assets/NHQ202404080308.png "Wait until the animals start acting weird, the wine-guzzling neighbor covering their face with a colander tells me...")

We proudly(?) present a chat log from the afternoon of 2024 April 08, recently disclosed.

 > Hey, I need your help.

 > When the eclipse started, three demons crawled their way out of the basement!

 > Sorry, *the demons three*, or more like pretentious weirdos three.

 > They probably came through the crack in the foundation that formed during the earthquake, the other day.

 > Anyway, they say that I must answer three riddles to determine the fate of humanity.

 > Again, sorry:  *their riddles three*.  I can feel a headache coming on, if this keeps up...

 > If I have any friends, they say as if they have any, then I can ask one of them for help with the riddles.

 > I chose you. {% emoji person shrugging %}

 > I hope that you get these.  Maybe eclipses work like New Year's Eve, where everybody calls everyone else and clogs up the network.

 > This seems important, though, what with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, and all.

 > Whatever...

 > Riddle #1:  Why doth thine train leaveth yon station at 1:58?

 > Wait, hold on.  I don't need help with that.  But I need to know why these ancient demons tell riddles about industrial technology that end in puns. {% emoji locomotive %}

 > Also, that grammar sounds wrong, but I guess that they must know what they want to say.

 > Huh.  They find it funny to make humans say "two-to-two," they say. {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > Riddle #2:  Would that I could explain what one might describe as black and white and red all over?

 > Sorry, they've looked over my shoulder to correct my spelling.  *R-E-A-D*.  Seriously?

 > Yeah, I got that one right, too, which no doubt comes as a no **news** to you, either, with their addendum. {% emoji newspaper %}

 > I might need to call them on that convoluted grammar, though.  I wouldn't call that riddle a question.

 > Do you still even check this chat?  No time for that, now, I guess.

 > Riddle #3, which they call the big one.

 > Oh, come on, the pockets thing?  They don't even wear pants!  They can't have anything in pockets that they don't have.

 > Also, that comes from a book, which if they *read* it, they'd know why it doesn't work as a riddle.

 > Oh, well.

 > Apparently, I survived the gauntlet of riddles.

 > Humanity will continue to thrive...to the limited extent that it has. {% emoji woohoo %}

 > I think the Demon One---

 > Gah, now they have me doing it.

 > I think that the one demon might cry.  He seemed to look forward to the potential extermination or dominion or whatever they had as a plan.

 > Well, the tears made me feel pretty sorry for them, not to mention the pathetic riddles, so I told them the riddle about going to the dentist at tooth-hurty. {% emoji tooth %}

 > They hadn't heard that one before, not surprising with their poor oral hygiene.

 > I'll need to patch the wall that one's spit-take burned through, which might explain the poor oral hygiene.

 > Apparently, they might name me Potentate of Perdition for my riddle mastery, if I ever want a career-change.

 > They originally called the position "King of Hell," but I pointed out that the underworld needs to become more inclusive if they want to keep pace, these days.

 > They didn't understand what I meant, so I put it into terms that they could understand.

 > I went with the riddle about the doctor who can't operate on their child, even though the child's husband died in a car crash.

 > That, they understood, implausible as it seems.

 > Whew, they finally left.  I assume that they won't get far without pants (or eclipse glasses), plus they stole a bag of my favorite chips "for the road."

 > What jerks.

 > I hate eclipses so much.

 > Every single time, something like this happens.

 > And I always have to clean up after some mystical dingbats or other.

 > They all act like I have nothing better to do.

 > Do I get to go out and enjoy the eclipse?  No way...

 > Instead, I get mooned by pun-loving demons.

 > Farewell to...I want to say Al Pacino, Male-Coded, and Draggin' Nutso, maybe?  I dunno.  Good riddance, at least.

 > Seriously, eclipses annoy me so much.

 > Do you remember that one eclipse when I had to carve out the heart of a close friend to save humanity or Taco Tuesday or whatever they got on about? {% emoji anatomical heart %}

 > Scrubbing up the aftermath seriously derailed my day.  If you hadn't shown up to help...

 > Oh, *right*!

 > OK, having thought that through, now I can see why you haven't replied to any of these texts...

 > Yeah, my bad.  Although bleeding all over my carpet didn't exactly rate as one of your finest moments, either, honestly.

 > I suppose that you didn't exactly come over to help clean up on that one...

 > That reminds me.  I should go leave some flowers on your grave. {% emoji bouquet %} {% emoji headstone %}

I planned to create this little story as only a single social media post---or quick e-mail to friends, which I hadn't decided---announcing my frustration at annoying demons wasting my time during the eclipse.  I figured that would get a quick laugh from a dozen or so words, something like "ugh, I hate dealing with riddling demons during every eclipse," and then everyone could move on.  But as I chose my words, I wanted to include the sad excuses for riddles, and then I had the idea of a one-sided chat, at which point the story mostly felt like it wrote itself.

For the record, I saw no damage from last week's earthquake in the New York area, and the eclipse down here only hit around 90% of totality, in case you thought that any of this actually happened to *me*.

Oh, and I intended the (mangled) demons' names near the end to loosely reference to Alichino, Malacoda, and Draghignazzo from Dante's [**Inferno**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29).  They guard the Fifth Bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell, Malebolge, as members of the *Malebranche* or Evil Claws, and present themselves as significantly less addled and childish, although Dante did have the twelve demons communicate across long distance with genuine fart sounds---a combination of natural and simulated---so maybe I classed them up, somehow?  Gustave Doré definitely drew them without pants, though.
