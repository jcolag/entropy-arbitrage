This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Trans Girl Project**, including *The Dream* and the first ten pages of *The Tea*.

![The comic's cover, featuring a scantily clad, female-presenting person sitting with knees up to block most of the body](/blog/assets/000-trans-girl-project-cover-by-legendarya-da8funa.png "Nothing about this worries me half as much as the science fiction-y title font mixed with the word Project...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Trans Girl Project**
 * Location:  <https://www.deviantart.com/legendarya>
 * Released:  2016 -- 2023 (possibly the present)
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  [Aryadna Dreams](https://www.deviantart.com/legendarya/about)
 * Medium:  Web comic
 * Length:  Approximately forty-nine pages (or possibly hundreds)
 * Content Advisories:  Some nudity, indications of secondary sex characteristics, some maybe-pushy dating

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Trans Girl Project

The comic bills itself as follows.

 > A feminist porn comic about the fantasies of an asexual trans girl.

Early pages list two translations.

 > [Spanish:](https://legendarya.deviantart.com/art/Trans-Girl-Project-ESP-Portada-607127108)[legendarya.deviantart.com/art/…](https://legendarya.deviantart.com/art/TGP-ESP-Patreon-Page-607127927)
 >
 > Japanese: [nugalis.com/comics/trans-girl-…](http://nugalis.com/comics/trans-girl-project)

I don't know how literally or seriously the author meant that description, nor do I know how many pages *actually* belong in the comic, or much of anything else, so we'll stick to the three stories in their own section with clear identification and work from there.  This might---I don't know, as I write this---mean skipping a bunch of the story, but we can all always read more at another time.

To the extent that the description of the comic as pornography holds true, I'll reiterate what I said when talking about [Eroticature]({% post_url 2021-07-31-eroticature %}):  Erotica doesn't generally titillate me, because it represents somebody else's fantasy.  That creates an immediate problem in discussions like this, because generally, the story exists in service to the "sexy bits," so if what turns you on doesn't turn me on, then the story unfairly falls flat, possibly regardless of its quality.

## What Works Well?

Arya feels like a fully formed character, probably not coincidentally when she shares a name with the creator, pseudonym or not.  She has a distinct history and views that never felt like talking points to deliver or an attempt to humanize a plot point.

Likewise, the date(?) seems like an ideal pretext for light exposition.  In most contexts, finding out Arya's age or when she moved where would probably require some contrivance to mention it, but here, it would probably seem weird if the scene *failed* to mention such things in passing.  And the awkwardness of an early date masks the awkwardness of the author telling us about the protagonist.

And despite the inevitable [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) issues with any attempt at realistic art, no matter what the medium, everything does actually look pretty good.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The pre-date feels like something went wrong in the writing.  On the first page of *The Tea*, the presentation seems to suggest that Arya and Xana already have some sort of relationship, looking for someplace to go while they walk and exchange stories.  But then Xana talks about her name as if for the first time, leading Arya to wonder about Xana's gender, and Xana soon talks about her transition as if everybody knows.  It feels like some aspect of the story might have changed, but not all the pages got the message.

And speaking of Xana, where we end the reading for this post, she feels a little manipulative in a way that I don't think the creator intended.  I mean, telling someone that you don't sense a barrier between you while reaching for their hands reads a lot like ignoring Arya's boundaries, especially following it with an assertion that she'd move much faster without a fear of hurting anyone.

## Opportunities

The first non-cover page of the comic has a fairly robust description on helping out.

 > Before starting with the comic, I want to tell you that I have created an account for this project: [www.patreon.com/aryafae](https://www.patreon.com/aryafae)
 >
 > If I were able to make money with this, I will allocate it to:
 >
 > - The Expenses of my own transition
 >
 > - Graphic card & 3D models for the comic
 >
 > - My project of e-learning Japanese
 >
 > For patrons, there will be more risqué fan-service (bonus content). My character in the comic is my self-conscious or repressed side. It's a different kind of porn, but in the fan-service there will be more freedom.
 >
 > You can also ask me personal questions and give me your own suggestions for fan-service. You can even ask to see photos of my transition. However, I might not agree to every request.
 >
 > I do not have high hopes of making money on this project, but know that it will continue even if there are no contributions. If I can get other people excited about my work to the point that they are willing to pay for it, I will feel very proud.

They also list (big corporate) social media links, if you'd rather take that approach, and I should also note that while the author seems to have gone on hiatus, most pages of the comic (so far) have a fairly lively comment thread, including readers helping with translation.

## What's Adaptable?

These pages introduce Nozomi, the (so far only dreamed) goddess of wishes.

Our two characters also start their maybe-a-date at a tea house in [Oviedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviedo)---confirmed the city in Spain, as opposed to others, in comments---which if it exists in the real world, I can't find it.  It stands on a corner, across the street from someplace called Quick Pick *something*, presumably a convenience store that I also can't find in our world.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll finish reading **Trans Girl Project** with the remainder of *The Tea* and (all of) *The Sport Bra*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
