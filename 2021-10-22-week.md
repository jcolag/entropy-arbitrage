As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:02 -- Mon 18 October 2021

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1450084750152978441) [The Freedom to Vote Act Is No ‘Compromise.’ Pass It Now.](https://otherwords.org/the-freedom-to-vote-act-is-no-compromise-pass-it-now/) from OtherWords

 > This all leads to an inescapable conclusion: Voting rights advocates in Congress must go it alone to protect those rights if necessary, and they must eliminate any procedural obstacles that stand in the way.

This gets to the heart of a critical issue:  The current assault on voting rights needs action as soon as possible, to be relevant for the 2022 election in literally a bit more than a year's time.  While it's admittedly exciting to have politicians who refuse to compromise, that excitement isn't going to translate to results, if it delays action.  In fact, you'll notice that the political party that gets the most use out of the idea is the party that constantly talks about how opposed they are to governance.

 > Scientists reported an early sign of this chatter between chloroplast and nucleus back in 1979 while studying a mutant form of barley that grew green, white and striped leaves.

Considering that chloroplasts *probably* originated as [cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria), it's wild to see how central they've become to cellular operation.

 > The English lexicon for illness grew through loan words, but local knowledge systems could not keep pace due to colonial subjugation.

It's hard to imagine a viable solution, at this point, unfortunately, especially coming from a privileged position of English immersion.  It's important, though, and systemic throughout the sciences.

 > Just as the track of birds that cleave the air is not discovered, nor yet the path of fish that skim the water, so the course of those who do good actions is not always seen.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1451171662167044097) [After Docs 'Show What We Feared' About Amazon's Monopoly Power, Warren Says 'Break It Up'](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/10/13/after-docs-show-what-we-feared-about-amazons-monopoly-power-warren-says-break-it) from Common Dreams

 > ...Amazon provided a written response that did not address the reporters' questions.

After decades of regulators and legislators who were actively opposed to anti-trust work, it's good to see an administration and Congress actually considering getting to work.

 > But the fact that punishment is an expression of negative attitudes makes it risky.

This is obviously true of all punitive systems, but the difference with the death penalty is that there can't be any margin for error.  It's theoretically possible to compensate someone for other punishments that they have unfairly received, but we can't exactly bring people back from the dead.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Imagined jazz improv changes the brain like real singing](https://www.futurity.org/jazz-musicians-improvisation-brains-2642832/) from Futurity

 > The new findings reveal that improvisation is associated with a state of weak connectivity to the brain’s executive control network and to a feeling of “flow,” which allows unhindered musical creation.

I wonder if it also works if you imagine imagining the improvisation...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Peter Telfer, the Trinidadian percussionist who made African drumming a church staple, goes to his Creator](https://globalvoices.org/2021/10/15/peter-telfer-the-trinidadian-percussionist-who-made-african-drumming-a-church-staple-goes-to-his-creator/) from Global Voices

 > A music enthusiast from childhood, when he began playing with his lifelong friend, the exemplary flautist and saxophonist Dawud Orr, who passed away this past August, Telfer was a deeply spiritual man whose Roman Catholic faith was intertwined with every note he created.

The area seems to have been losing quite a few artists, lately.  It's unfortunate, but I guess a fact of life.
