{% cw #1 --- This post talks frankly about politics.  If my using terms like "fascism" and "insurrection" might hurt your delicate feelings, then you might want to take a breath before reading or consider heading somewhere else. %}

{% cw #2 --- This post will talk about media that doesn't come under Free Culture licenses.  It'll probably also blend in some public domain works and throw in a couple of Free Culture works at the end, though. %}

During Donald Trump's first administration, journalists obsessed over how to most effectively give white supremacists and other fascists a platform, from "Nazi next door" profiles to giving them places to directly share their views with the world without any mediation.  They did this for a few reasons, none of them particularly *good*.  Most publicly, they did this as self-flagellation, insisting that people who know and care about immigrants, descendants of slaves, queer folks, and so forth "live in a bubble" and need to better know "the real America," where people see all those groups as an invasive force.  But it also fits well with a business model (advertising) that requires keeping the audience in a constant state of anxiety, not to mention that decades of media consolidation mean that the CEO would *really* like everybody to get on-board with policies that let them pillage the country.

![The Wicked Witch of the West, original version](/blog/assets/wwoo-xii-wicked-witch-west.png "I've worn outfits that matched less...")

At the time, pundits chose to take their frustrations out on...fiction.  They screamed that, because studios---Disney in particular---had started revisiting classic stories from the perspective of the "villain," they had primed the country to accept fascists.  By humanizing former antagonists and making their lashing out comprehensible, they argued, it blurs the lines of morality, creating nihilistic readers who don't worry about evil.  Finding that an interesting but hopelessly flawed hypothesis, I started writing about it for the early days of the blog, but put it aside with Biden's election, figuring that the time had passed.

Here we stand, though, years later, both Trump and the idea have returned.  This time, we don't have people shaming Disney, but rather Warner Bros. Discovery for the **Joker** films and NBCUniversal for **Wicked**, right on time for Trump's second win.  And so, it seems like the time to resurrect that old post idea---despite that the long history might cause some issues in following along---if only because I don't get to talk about superheroes, musical theater, or even the Oz stories nearly enough...

## Disclaimers

Maybe interestingly, I haven't actually seen most of the films in question, though I have a fairly solid knowledge of their franchises and predecessors.  As such, a particular instance of the idea could have merit, in the sense that 2021's **Cruella** might plausibly take some specific fascism-friendly step that I don't know; maybe she wears a KKK hood made from Dalmatian fur in a mid-credits scene.  But the broad strokes seem more important than the details, in this case.

Actually, scratch that.  I apparently *did* watch **Cruella** on Disney+---thank you, past-John, for deciding to note everything that you've watched...---but don't remember much of the plot.  I definitely haven't seen the *Maleficent* or *Joker* films, though, and will wait for **Wicked** to show up on streaming.

## Context

I want to look at these villains, especially with an eye towards what they deliberately or accidentally represent in their worlds.  For example, a lot of vampire fiction---which I'll bring up here, because we have a welcome respite from vampire-centric fiction at the moment, so it doesn't affect the rest of the post---plays on fears of immigrants, strange people coming from overseas to conquer "our" women and *maybe* turn a few men gay, if they have extra time.  Many 1980s film villains drew on fears of corporate dominance, expanding into human spaces and turning against us.  And those have different political valences.

For that to make sense, though, we probably want to take a look at where these villains live, since destruction also has different political valences, depending on whether we support or oppose the structure under attack.

### The Disney Milieu

We all know how this will go, I imagine.

Most Disney characters live in a shockingly similar and worryingly regressive land or era.  In that time and place, you have such severe inequality that women either do housework or attend balls, with little in between.  Especially for a woman, the best bet to improve your lot in life has a lot to do with marrying into the royal family.  The wealthy and the poor can agree on one thing, though, that they need to stamp out any whiff of rebellion or deviance in their circles, equating literacy with monstrosity and an interest in other cultures with treason.

Leaders range from oblivious to tyrannical---the former class aided by someone who handles the tyranny on their behalf---though they might engage in a brief compromise at the end of the story, if the protagonist can't finish the arc without their blessing.

And that all ignores the monarchy part as an artifact of the time, but they all do live under a regime where some jackass says that he owns everything that you can see, and that you owe him taxes for the use of it all, because some deity made a deal---a handshake deal, understand, nothing on paper that you could authenticate---with his grandfather.

### Gotham City

As mentioned, I haven't watched these, because they feel trite.  I know that the original lifts most of its plot from a classic crime film, which doesn't interest me.  Joaquin Phoenix never impressed me in the way that his late brother did in his short life.  And the Joker always bored me as an antagonist, so seeing him as a protagonist didn't excite me at all, a character who you can reduce to three boring archetypes, the irritating practical joker, the failed comic who becomes a mob boss[^1], and the Philosophy 101 student who believes that nobody else has ever learned about game theory.

[^1]:  Given how many modern fascists always try to get a laugh for saying mean things, if the new films cover this interpretation and try to make it look heroic, that would definitely qualify as one of the specific exceptions.

Anyway, even though I don't care for how the Joker manifests as a character, in comics or on-screen, it seems laughable to suggest that the character represents a step towards fascism.  In fact, when you think about it, the character's concept makes sense, and especially makes sense as a potential sort of role-model, in the right context.  After all, consider the world that the Joker comes from.

Across all media, Bruce Wayne---as I've probably mentioned before---attempts to resolve the trauma stemming from the murder of his billionaire parents by lurking in the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Gotham City, hunting for desperate people who he can brutalize without the public caring.  Many of his recurring targets, the Joker most prominently, have psychiatric disabilities.  Yes, despite his admittedly stylish approach to it, we cheer on Batman because he beats up the impoverished and disabled.

Oh, and some of his recurring targets don't like how the company that he owns does business, so this violence also serves to maintain his net worth.

### Oz

Again, I haven't seen the **Wicked** film, yet.  I've never liked going to the movie theater, and like it even less since people gave up on trying to limit the spread of COVID-19.  However, I read Gregory Maguire's **Wicked** when it came out and still have it on my shelf, saw the musical on Broadway with the original cast[^2], and have listened to the album regularly for about twenty years, not to mention having known most of Baum's Oz books to various extents before that and many of the major adaptations, though (maybe ironically) not the big adaptation that comes to your mind, for whatever reason; I mean, I know the songs, but never sat down to watch Judy Garland and company.

[^2]:  I actually had the original cast minus Joel Grey, who fell ill earlier that day, but I call that close enough, even though I looked forward to seeing Grey in it.

Because of that, I might speak a bit more authoritatively about the 2024 film than I might otherwise.  I mean, I've listened to **Part One**'s soundtrack a couple of times and watched the **Defying Gravity** behind-the-scenes thing on Peacock, and it all suggests that we won't have too many big surprises, but something *could* slip through, in theory.

In any case, I should note that we have multiple competing versions of Oz to look at, here.

#### Literary Oz

When I think about the Oz books, two ideas compete to get noticed first.  I'll present them in order of publication.

First, in Baum's brief introduction to **The Wonderful Wizard of Oz**, he states that he writes the book...

 > ...solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.

You got that?  He wrote it *solely* for pleasure, with absolutely no pesky issues or agendas to get in the way of the fun.

Soon after---the second chapter---we find out a couple of things about this new land.

 > There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.

The witch from the North (later given various names) explains morality in a way that immediately sounds shady.  I call myself good, in essence, therefore that sets my moral alignment and that of my opponents.

Then, in discussing the geography of Oz and why Dorothy can't conveniently leave, the Munchkins and the north also explain that---in more modern terminology---everybody in Oz lives in areas strictly segregated along racial lines.  This discussion lays out the four major races of the area, but Dorothy stumbles on assorted ethnic enclaves on her journey.

In the following chapter, Boq informs us that Oz also has something of a caste system, as he explains why he calls Dorothy a sorceress.

 > Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.

Not only do they limit the use of white clothing, but he goes on to explain that they also color-code the *races* of Oz, with Munchkins---as the previous chapter more quietly indicated---wearing blue, because Dorothy's "blue and white checked" dress identifies her as a witch friendly to the Munchkins.  Later in the series, the color thing gets weirdly blown off as a coincidental favorite color of a quarter of the population, but they use it for clothing, crafts, and agricultural crops, suggesting more than some innocent regional preference.

Oh, and slavery seems widespread enough that nobody finds it worth screaming about.  They mention in passing that the wicked witches have enslaved their people---although, given the north witch's ideas about good and evil, we might wonder if that would hold true, or if subjects become slaves because they have "wicked" leaders---and warn Dorothy that she might join them, but other than Dorothy herself as an afterthought, nobody really seems interested in abolishing the practice.

Finally, we have the governance of Oz in general, where we find out that a ventriloquist from Omaha, who...actually, let's let him tell the post-ballooning part of that story.

 > Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.

Yeah.  For his *personal amusement*, he subjugated this strange land and set them to work building him a capital city with a palace for, I would argue, a colonial government that deposed the (already problematic) royal family.  While we meet people struggling out in the countryside, the Wizard has a city "abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy."

And let's get to the first book's famous ending, shall we?  The book wants us to dislike the Wizard, because he lied to Dorothy in order to put her in the path of the Wicked Witch of the West, hoping for the latter's demise in the face of his new child soldier.  But the "good witch" from the North sent Dorothy to the Wizard, remember, and when Dorothy cries about her inability to get back home without the Wizard, she has a suggestion.

 > “The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.”

That kind of feels like something that somebody could've mentioned at the *start of the book*, instead of her counterpart from the North handing over the shoes while claiming that nobody can travel beyond the borders due to the pesky desert.

Oh, and one last tidbit from the first book, in case you still need a sense of what kind of culture Oz has.  We learn about one of the Witch of the North's predecessors from the King of the Winged Monkeys.

 > At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish.

The unobjectionable children's adventure book casually mentions that time that one of the "good" regional leaders sexually groomed a child.  Even better, he doesn't make this the point of the story, only the prologue.  On the day of the wedding, the monkey-king's grandfather got the kid's fancy clothes wet, so Gayelette enslaved the flying monkeys.  {% emoji person shrugging %} Hooray...?

#### The Wizard of Oz, 1939

Not having actually sat through the film, I don't really have anything to say about it, other than its popularity has almost certainly eclipsed that of the books.  And the shorter time that a feature film has to discuss issues presumably means that it avoids detailing the politics and culture of Oz.

We might want to note one key simplification that, as I understand it, the film skips the northern witch in favor of using Glinda as the mentor figure at both the beginning and end of the journey.  I point this out, because it means that our sole representative of "good" magic sets Dorothy down the gold-paved path of executing her rival and ousting the usurper, then tells her that, oh, she actually could've gone home before the end of the first act and should do that now, if she *really* wanted to[^3].

[^3]:  [**Gaslight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_%281944_film%29), giving us the modern verb, wouldn't come out for another five years, otherwise we'd more readily call Glinda's move [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).

I don't think that we need a revisionist retelling to assert that Glinda manipulated a child into doing the heavy lifting of a coup d'état, then shuffling her away before she can capitalize on the respect that she earned in her quest, leaving her clear to rule or install a puppet government or literally whatever she wants...

#### Wicked, the Novel

While Maguire made some rather unfortunate comments in his introduction about villains that he considered using before humanizing the Wicked Witch of the West---yes, exactly the real-world person who you think gets a mention as the potential protagonist of the book, severely undermining my argument---he mostly spends the actual novel making the subtext of the original book explicit.  The Wizard has manipulated everybody, trying to solve unrest by enslaving the intelligent animals and a propaganda campaign, while the "good witches" similarly coast more on style than substance.  The Gale Force storm-troopers hunt and destroy resistance in their name.

#### Wicked, the Musical

The musical streamlines a lot of Maguire's story, also changing the story to center it on the personal relationships, but maintains much of the quiet inequality and the authoritarian governance.

Also, spectacular music, for the most part.  Tying this to another of our sources of villainous protagonists, I can't imagine that you get to **Frozen**'s *Let It Go* without *Defying Gravity* breaking a lot of that ground, first...and probably **Chess**'s *Nobody's Side* long before that, too, but never mind the tangents.  (And I don't mean that in the sense that Idina Menzel has played all three characters.)

## Etymology

Now, we should maybe take a look at what the word [villain](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/villain) *means*, historically, now that we have some core context.  Wiktionary has this to say about the term.

 > Probably from Middle English *vilein*, from Old French *vilein* (modern French *vilain*), in turn from Late Latin *villanus*, meaning serf or peasant, someone who is bound to the soil of a Latin villa, which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a plantation in late Antiquity, in Italy or Gaul.

Huh.  Historically, villain has meant something like a slave, though technically considered free, a laborer considered part of a plot of land.  I honestly didn't expect that, but it tracks, and it fits exactly with the direction that I want to take this.  The shift appears to originate in the difference in manners, but underlying arguments over manners, you often have the idea of somebody acting above their station.

And that similarly ties in with many villains.  Think about the number of fictional villains who express misogynist, homophobic, or anti-Semitic stereotypes.  In "polite" (by which I mean bigoted, here) society, women, queer folks, Jewish folks, people with disabilities, and many others violate etiquette by nothing more than existing in public.  "Seen, but not heard," my father liked to say.  They stand far above their station by nothing more than showing up, to the point where we have words like [uppity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uppity) to describe it.

## Putting This Together

Now that we have a rough history of *villain* and an overview of the (fictional) places where the current villain-protagonists come from, let's see what kind of picture that paints.

It looks like we have 2013's [**Frozen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_%282013_film%29), 2014's [**Maleficent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent_%28film%29), 2019's [**Maleficent:  Mistress of Evil**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent:_Mistress_of_Evil), and 2021's [**Cruella**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruella_%28film%29) as Disney's "overwhelming trend" of films that tell stories from the traditional antagonist's perspective.  But to that, we'll add 2019's [**Joker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%282019_film%29) and this year's [**Joker: Folie à Deux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker:_Folie_%C3%A0_Deux), plus [**Wicked:  Part I**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_%282024_film%29).  I repeat that I haven't watched the bulk of them.  But I also repeat that this alleged cultural sea change consists of *seven* films over the course of eleven years, maybe eight if we stretch to include independent 2022 parody [**The People's Joker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Joker) that sounds a lot more interesting than the other Joker films...

Why count **Frozen**, by the way, when Disney has never presented the protagonist to us as antagonistic?  Two reasons.  First, while the story doesn't revise a classic Disney film, it *does* retell and adapt [*The Snow Queen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Queen), where the title character definitely doesn't help the protagonists.  And second, if you look at the story from the perspective of a no-name character who doesn't have any insight into the film's narrative, you see the crown princess abandoning her people in a huff and creating a perpetual winter.  It only really skipped the step of drawing from a classic movie to completely qualify.

I'd like to draw attention to the breakdown, here.  In (charitably) eight films, six or seven of them have a female protagonist---I don't know whether to count Harley Quinn---with two featuring two women as co-protagonists, one featuring a transgender woman, and one featuring a Black woman.  The sole white male protagonist comes from a lower-class background and (skimming Wikipedia, since I linked to the pages) has a neurological disability.

Then, we have the inciting incidents, ignoring sequels.  In **Frozen**, Elsa serves as the villain of the story, because her (royal) family forced her to suppress her powers until they lashed out uncontrollably, and mostly makes amends when she works out what happened.  In **Maleficent**, the title character becomes the villain because a neighboring king wants to conquer the place that she protects, and her ex disfigures her.  **Joker** has the main character harassed by the wealthy, ignored by the police, and cut off from support through government austerity.  **The People's Joker** seems to not actually become a villain, despite assorted trauma.  And **Wicked** has Elphaba become a freedom fighter against the repressive and borderline-genocidal regime that also wants to exploit her extreme affinity for magic for its own ends, with Glinda differing in that she hopes that they can reform the system from the inside, because she has less raw power.

**Cruella** seems like an outlier, here, someone whose big trauma seemed to revolve around not enjoying the unpleasant parts of her career, so she becomes a criminal...I think.  I haven't seen it in a few years.  You might have some luck drawing some relationship between loving that movie and, say, [Kash Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kash_Patel), who follows the same arc of feeling disillusioned by his career and feeling the urge to tear down the institutions that and people who he feels wronged him.  But the majority seem fairly distinct from that world, and in fact fight *against* that kind of world.

Remember, the idea of villainy comes from poor manners.  And I think that we can see this take shape---discarding that last item---where the derided "villains as heroes" stories represent disadvantaged people, often exactly as in their original portrayals, pushing back against a world that would rather harm or eliminate people like them or their allies.

Minus the criminality aspects, we've definitely seen this before.  How many times have we heard a right-wing politician explain that, while they *totally* respect the right of the people to protest injustice, they can't approve of a protest that inconveniences people...oh, and the [quiet protests that don't inconvenience anybody](https://therealnews.com/kneeling-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-dave-zirin-on-the-kaepernick-effect) also seem bad, for mysterious reasons.  Or sometimes, they make it [legal to kill protesters](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/new-anti-protest-laws-cast-a-long-shadow-on-first-amendment-rights/), if you find them too inconvenient.  And on almost every corporate social media site, you can openly support or even call for genocide against pretty much any disadvantaged group without any trouble, then have people banned when they call your suggestion racist.  In every case, these sorts of people see social progress---or even pointing problems out---as far worse than perpetuating systemic problems.

Any "danger" to society from supporting (most of) these villains sounds a lot more like the [good trouble](https://publicintegrity.org/inside-publici/newsletters/the-moment/special-edition-remembering-john-lewis/) of impolitely upending some unfair systems than hurting people for the sake of it.

### Don't Shoot People

Tangentially, I think that we can all agree that we don't generally condone violence, even for an alleged good cause.  However, I should also bring up a quote that I've almost certainly brought up before in other contexts.

 > Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.

{% cite John F. Kennedy %}

We can say that we can never condone violence, but when we block every avenue that we *might* condone, you'll need to expect some violence, regardless of whether we want to condone it, because you've left people with no other way to communicate.

And note that, in most cases, the villains fight against authorities that---even prior to the various revisionist retellings---look a lot like they oppress and silence everybody except for the elites.  1939-Dorothy feels emblematic of the whole idea, where our protagonist becomes a pawn torn between elites, where the winner (Glinda) stands unopposed and unchecked...but the film (and novel) quietly ignores those aspects.  It would rather you not ask questions about "only a story."

This quiet shift away from potential problems, in turn, ties back into the central thesis, here.  Even while we wonder which villains look like fascists or criminals and which ones look like liberators from authoritarianism or ("only") victims of the regime, we should also consider how the "sympathizing with villains gives us fascists" idea comes closer to reflecting the views of fascists, at least in their modern incarnation.

What, after all, do we hear most from these right-wing types?  They all want to return to "a simpler time," a time when people didn't have these big problems with gender and race and labor relations and whatever else.  But we know that people have *always* had those problems, especially in the West, where we needed to fabricate [race science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism) to justify colonizing places where other cultures already had societies, when we wanted their land.

And worse, you can tell that *they* know it, too, by the policies that they propose to allegedly fix problems.  Housing, they want to fix by arresting homeless people (and now families of immigrants).  Labor, they want to solve by eliminating unions, so that everybody negotiates personally and in secret.  Sexism, they want to solve by keeping women at home and (ideally) pregnant.  Other gender and sexuality issues, they want to solve by forcing gender and sexual minorities back into the closet.  Race, they want to solve by not allowing anybody to talk about it.  They want to stop protests and definitely stop strikes.  And the list goes on, seemingly endlessly.

Do you see the common thread between those policies?  Other than the un-American and un-Christian nature from Christian nationalists, I mean.  Rather than fixing anything, all the policies aim to reduce the chances that they'll need to acknowledge or even *know about* the problem.  Leave it to everybody to deal with their problems in private---or in prison, away from the general population---where people can pretend that the problem doesn't exist.

I assume that I didn't think of this first, but they don't mean "a simpler time" in history that they'd like to return to.  They mean "a simpler time" in their *lives*, the simplicity of childhood, where well-meaning adults work to shield children from worrying about the real world.  All the problems today existed a hundred and more years ago, many in far worse forms, but a privileged person could live their lives without knowing about the problems, exactly as the pre-revisionist versions of these fictional worlds try to quietly ignore the blatant abuses on display in the backgrounds.  You can almost directly draw a line from this behavior, in fact, back to the Wizard of Oz speaking through puppets and requiring everybody to wear green-tinted glasses to gloss over the fact that he didn't and can't actually solve anybody's problems.

### Purely Coincidental Exceptions

I should note that *certain* films in this vein seem exempt from criticism, in that they don't ever get mentioned as contributing to the fall of civilization.  You don't see a moral panic about Sony's films about Spider-Man villains.  You don't see a moral panic about mob movies.  And you don't even see a moral panic about heist flicks.  Those, the pundits like.

The mob movies seem especially ironic, given that they tell stories about people in organizations that come about due to the perception of a weak government that fails its people, prioritizes loyalty to leaders over anything else, and enforces their direction with threats of violence.  Nobody blames authoritarians on stories about the people who authoritarians model themselves after.  I wonder why...

I mean, I don't *actually* wonder why.  When you think about popular films in those three genres, what do the protagonists look like in your imagination?  At least in the public eye, you get people in here like Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, George Clooney, Tom Hardy, and the like.  Maybe you can see some common thread among them, maybe a common thread that might serve to distinguish their characters from the "dangerous" villains that we discussed above.

Personally, I see two common threads.

First, as the previous section got into, these stories don't engage in pointing out the uncomfortable politics of beloved childhood media.  [**The Godfather**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather) doesn't ask us to engage in any media literacy or question the nature of morality.

More importantly, though, none of them asks us to cheer for somebody in an underclass.  We have cisgender, heterosexual white male characters---often wealthy or otherwise high-status, no less---committing crimes for personal reasons, often the thrill of it or to maintain power.  Sure, you have outliers in this set.  [**Venom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%282018_film%29) and its sequels have apparently leaned into its impression of queer-coding, and the alien "suit" traditionally does need to eat people to survive.  But for the most part, the villains that pundits have cleared us to view as heroes, by and large, have privilege and want to keep it that way.

And that latter distinction contrasts sharply with the predominantly female, often non-white, and sometimes disabled presentation of the villains that allegedly doomed us to authoritarianism.

However, who bears more of a conceptual or physical resemblance to the image of Trump and company, Vito Corleone or Elphaba?  Which model would you rather condemn as evil, and how will that serve you when dealing with authoritarians?

## Bonus:  Free Culture Villainy

While I have the topic on my mind, and since we might need more examples of non-white and queer folks rebelling against unjust systems, I'd like to present two Free Culture projects that I know about that fit neatly in this vein.  One regular readers will have seen before, the other not.  One knows its role, the other seemingly fell into it accidentally.

### Noir & Blanc

Back in April (of this year), the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) discussed Lizzie Crowdagger's [**Noir & Blanc**]({% post_url 2024-04-13-noir-blanc-1 %}), a French novel that gets right to the heart of this discussion, by representing classes of people who more or less definitionally function as either good or evil.  One of our protagonists, a "demon," lives a normal life, except for...well, let's let the author describe the situation from the co-protagonist's perspective, in translation to English.

 > Not only is her childhood friend (or was she an enemy?) apparently involved in this dark story, but this is not an isolated event.  But the most embarrassing thing is that “White Light”, a sect dedicated to the elimination of demons and other cursed creatures, has decided to take the matter in hand to clean up.

Anyway, Mélanie and Laura go on the run together---the former walking away from her job as a police officer---and have a flirty relationship while they try to unravel the murderous conspiracy.  And along the way, we need to ask what makes Laura (the demon) so "evil" that it makes her worthy of extermination, while she protects her friend, helps her to try to uncover and stop a killer, and maybe even unravel a dangerous system.

I feel like this book, if people read it, would do a good job of forcing people to choose between the two distinctions that I noted in the mob/heist/other white guy movies.  Would we embrace the leads of the book because they rebel without trying to revise our understanding of more famous works?  Or would we condemn them as supporting literal "evil incarnate" (a demon), and coincidentally not notice the metaphor about queer women in the subtext?

We probably already know the answer to this, but I still want you to give it some thought.

### The Usurper

This feels like a harder sell, and will take more set-up and explanation than usual, but bear with me.  I haven't talked about this cluster of works for the Free Culture Book Club, for two reasons.  First, with the least complexity, the contents don't lend themselves at all well to picking out a narrative, disconnected profiles that mostly (but not always) exist as part of a shared world with a defining characteristic of allowing almost anything without worrying about it making sense.  And second but more complex, I feel uncomfortable giving the author the attention, since he appears to live in a mean-spirited, right-wing bubble, where he can't even really use formal licenses.  It doesn't help that the illustrations all come from sources under copyright, either.

{% cw I mean that second point seriously, by the way.  If you click around (not recommended), you'll quickly find characters who exist to "take down" or otherwise mock racial, sex, gender, and religious minorities, alongside creatures who patrol the streets to find and execute anti-fascists, along with helpful commentary to tell you that he *absolutely* wishes that political opposition and minorities would get zapped out of the way of the good (hateful) people and how social justice will destroy the world.  Oh, and you'll find plenty of Nazi characters, too, for (ahem) "some reason." %}

With those caveats in mind, allow me to present Amanacer-Fiend0's [The Usurper](https://www.deviantart.com/amanacer-fiend0/art/Open-Source-The-Usurper-678208649).  I want to draw attention to this, because even a stopped clock can tell the correct time twice a day, as they say.

To save you the trouble of reading through, if you know comics and superheroes, then you probably already have some familiarity with Fawcett's [Captain Marvel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29)[^4].  With a large body of appearances in the public domain, young Billy Batson stumbles into an abandoned subway station, where (skipping a couple of steps) the wizard Shazam grants him the divine powers of Solomon, Hercules, Achilles, Zeus, Atlas, and Mercury, or maybe I have Atlas and Achilles in the wrong order.  For a while, Captain Marvel outsold Superman by a significant margin, and the similarity to Superman led to lawsuits back and forth that (along with a downturn in the market) drove Fawcett out of business.  DC Comics (now owned by Warner Brothers) bought the trademarks and valid copyrights to the character, and has tried repeatedly to figure out how to make the character work for a modern audience.

[^4]:  And don't confuse Billy with the Captain Marvel from Marvel Comics, staking claim to the trademark that better fits their corporate identity than any of their competitors.  Don't worry, the Usurper's creator also has a character dedicated to telling you how much he totally doesn't find Alison Brie's Captain Marvel attractive...

Due to the many public domain appearances, though, Warner has competition from independent creators with their own takes on the classic character.  And in this case, our right-winger has crafted---I have to imagine accidentally, because his commentary seems to really want us to hate her---a "villain" who makes my point about who gets called villainous extraordinarily well.

Imagine, if you will, genius engineer Racheal Beter, a Black woman.  She develops fancy technology that taps into the same power as Captain Marvel, and goes out into the world as a superhero, seeing not nearly enough representation by people like her.  "No matter what she does, guys like Captain Marvel...don't take her seriously," the profile actually says.  This turns her bitter towards the heroes.  And that bitterness towards the superheroes who don't take her seriously, and seemingly nothing more, that makes her a villain.

The text tries to make her seem terrible, by suggesting that she sees some people as inferior---but Captain Marvel apparently does right by seeing *her* as inferior---and goes on about her "lust for power," but never actually suggests that she does anything bad.  Mostly, the gods didn't choose her, and working towards a higher-status position, especially as a Black woman, makes her bad.

The author goes on to explain that this character represents the trend of comics replacing 1960s white guys with "cheap imitations that didn't actually earn the right to be their successors," calling these successors "nothing but badly written wish fulfillment."  You know, as opposed to Captain Marvel, who literally got his powers handed to him, and written as *literal* wish fulfillment, in case you thought that this had any clever self-awareness to the twist.

I bring this character up, because---accidentally or not---the author absolutely nailed this idea.  A Black woman works hard to help people and, because the white, male authorities whose power fell into their laps through accidents of birth don't want her in their club, that makes her evil.  The legacy superheroes alongside the author see her as a villain, because they don't anything to remind them about white and male privilege, about their (*our* as a white guy, myself) mediocrity and unearned status.  Like I said, authoritarians all absolutely understand the problems that they studiously ignore.  Sometimes, like here or when they talk about [reparations]({% post_url 2021-02-14-reparations %}), the mask slips enough that they mistakenly make the progressive arguments for us while telling us how they'd rather see the world work.

Other characters in this vein from the author mostly only have lazy stereotypes portrayed as meanly as possible, so I don't recommend exploring (unless you like that sort of thing, for whatever reason), but this character feels *perfect*.  And it neatly sits out there under a weird, informal version of the Creative Commons Attribution license ("Feel free to use it any way you wish. You must also give creator credit"), waiting for some ambitious writer to defy the original creator and make her the hero fighting against a narrow-minded Captain Marvel who'd rather gate-keep heroism than help people.

## And Your Little Dog, Too

Back when I posted on [Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}) regularly, I'd often make the point---paraphrasing whatever I actually said---that for many people, they see two kinds of social progress, but they categorize it by their age, rather than activity.  If the fight for that progress happened before they became politically active, then they accept that fight as necessary and just.  But if the fight began *after* they became politically active, that scares them, and probably "goes too far."

In a lot of ways, this post makes a lengthy version of that idea for fiction, where media published before we learned to read often gets unconditionally accepted as appropriate for audiences with no reason to investigate it, whereas modern media feels subversive and worrisome.

However, we also have a dichotomy of villains, here.  One group takes the mantle of villainy because they want to gain or maintain their power and privilege.  The other has the mantle thrust on them, because they see a better world, offending people because they don't worry about their manners.  And while the latter might---if we learn its lessons---cause the downfall of the least-fair parts of our civilization, it probably doesn't cause us to embrace fascism while it rather explicitly fights back against it.

And we *should* side with the people, fictional and (especially) real, who try to tear down sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry, who stand up for the oppressed, and who want and need to live openly, even when they make us uncomfortable.

Finally, *maybe* we should start thinking twice about who we privilege as representing "goodness," even in---maybe esepcially in---children's media.
