As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112751015503129833) [Portable engine powers artificial muscles](https://www.futurity.org/portable-engine-powers-artificial-muscles-3235362/) from Futurity

 > The new engine works by pumping oil into and out of a chamber in a soft robot, causing the soft robot to act as an artificial muscle that is flexing and relaxing.

This (excellent) solution feels like it exposes a lot about the problems with the robotics industry in general.  We *can* design small robots that act assistively---smart prosthetics, for want of a better term---but instead the funding goes to teams making overly complicated humanoid robots whose only value comes from the ability of an owner to feel like they've abused a person without any consequences...

 > Conservative politicians who‚Äôd thrown fits over free speech on campus cheered as police officers roughed up and arrested student protesters. Some even called to deploy the National Guard, which infamously murdered four Kent State students during the Vietnam era.

Hashtags:  #Inequality #Protest #FreeSpeech

I'd generalize this further:  Inequality and civil rights can't coexist.  We *almost* recognize this in the United States at a fundamental and explicit level, because you can read the Bill of Rights especially as an attempt to prevent the concentration of power in any entity.  And you can see how people who want to promote inequality always look to the Bill of Rights for excuses to oppress.

I don't know Aiyejina's work, but I suppose that he now needs to go on my list...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112768706715555180)

 > Freedom depended on a very different circumstance. He was free, because he lived in a country governed by equal laws. Where the highest and the lowest were governed by the same laws, where there was no distinction of persons, there freedom might be said to exist as purely and as perfectly as in the nature of things it could exist.

Think about how terrified and impotent[^1] that you'd need to feel in order to threaten a murder spree if people don't give you whatever you want.  That gives me a lot of hope for at least this year's election, because people who think that they'll have influence in an organization or society generally don't need to shriek about how they *might* need some mass lynchings to get there.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Spirit of Revenge: John Roberts Says Joe Biden Can Demand an Investigation of Ginni Thomas](https://www.emptywheel.net/2024/07/03/spirit-of-revenge-john-roberts-says-joe-biden-can-demand-an-investigation-of-ginni-thomas/) from Empty Wheel

 > Here, Roberts turns the Take Care Clause on its head. Whereas conservative judge Karen Henderson viewed the Take Care Clause to require that the President obey the law, Roberts instead sees that as a source of permission for the President to demand investigations, even if they are proposed for an improper purpose.

While I don't generally enjoy the fantasies of using authoritarianism to "save" democracy---since the normalization of authoritarianism corrodes much more than it can every patch up---I do think that Biden would do well to exercise the unfettered powers that the Supreme Court has given the Oval Office as theatrical stunts to force the court to rethink their position.  Not that anybody would listen to me, but if I had Biden's ear, I'd *strongly* recommend that he do exactly this, *and* solicit a bribe (to donate to charity) in exchange for pardoning [Nicholas Roske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh_assassination_plot), *and* maybe have Samuel Alito arrested as an "enemy."

None of these actions would cause lasting damage---except maybe to the Thomases' credibility among their patrons---but all would demonstrate to the six conservative Justices that they *probably* don't want go engage in these sorts of power-grabs.
