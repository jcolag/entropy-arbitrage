{% cw We'll need to talk about the panicked height of the COVID-19 pandemic, plus I'll take a side on a famous lawsuit that will probably make a lot of people angry. %}

As you've probably heard by now, the Internet Archive's appeal in the [Hachette lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_v._Internet_Archive) has failed, and across the Internet, people have begun their complaining.  I have a more nuanced view, possibly because I view IA with more skepticism than many people do and so don't trust their blog posts.  As such, this seems like a good time to dust off and update a piece that I wrote for the July 2022 newsletter, back in...well, I forget when {% emoji winking face %}.

![The current Internet Archive headquarters, before they moved in](/blog/assets/Christian-science-church122908-02.png "Did they shop around for a building that matched their logo...?")

Interestingly, in that mini-post, I didn't identify what set me off on that line of thinking, but it doesn't actually matter, because the Internet Archive does this so frequently---don't worry, we have an entire section about it---that I have to imagine that this could have gone out five years ago or five years from now without many changes.

## Disclaimers

Before we get moving, I need to make the point that---broadly speaking, at least---I like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).  I really do.

While I have never run the math, I probably average visiting the site more than once per day, either looking for some book/film in the public domain/released under a Free License[^4], or using their Wayback Machine to find some piece of information that has scrubbed itself from the web.  Through [unrot∙link](https://unrot.link/), I have even integrated the latter into how the blog deals with outdated links, which I'd argue even *endorses* them, at least the Wayback Machine end of things.

[^4]:  And yes, *maybe* the occasional old television show that I can't find available elsewhere, on a whim, even though I'd rather avoid giving attention to the major studios.

Nobody should deny that they do some good work.

I, and many other people, use it so often, that we find ourselves tempted to think of the Internet Archive as a public service...but that doesn't describe it.  And I think that sits at the root of a lot of the reactions to the case.

Oh, I should mention that, like other long posts with a lot of citations, I didn't bother to identify links by license.  Or, rather, I started doing that, and it ended up looking fairly ugly, so I removed them.

## Hachette v. Internet Archive

Now, let's step back to look at the arc of the Hachette case.

In March 2020, when organizations closed down and the overwhelming majority of people wisely stayed home due to the uncertainty in the pandemic, the Internet Archive [announced their National Emergency Library](https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/24/announcing-a-national-emergency-library-to-provide-digitized-books-to-students-and-the-public/), which...looked a lot like their normal library functions, except that they wouldn't place any restrictions on "borrowing," replacing the metaphor of loaning physical books with (I'd argue) a streaming model.

Of particular note, they said the following about the program.

 > We recognize that authors and publishers are going to be impacted by this global pandemic as well. We encourage all readers who are in a position to buy books to do so, ideally while also supporting your local bookstore. If they don’t have the book you need, then Amazon or [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/) may have copies in print or digital formats. We hope that authors will support our effort to ensure temporary access to their work in this time of crisis. We are empowering authors to explicitly opt in and donate books to the National Emergency Library if we don’t have a copy. We are also making it easy for authors to contact us to take a book out of the library. [Learn more in our FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjErbouWG7pUlzcxPcRk4YEtbYs8ItlVTgLa1DfGh68/edit?usp=sharing).

We should note a few things, here.  First, they acknowledge the impact to industry, and "solve" this problem by suggesting that people buy books, *primarily* from Amazon---which takes a massive cut of every purchase while demanding that companies never sell for less than their price, not to mention the whole "hollowing out of downtowns" deal---with the B-corporation seemingly thrown in as an afterthought[^1].  They then ask hurting authors to help *them*, and hand-wave opting out by sending people to Google Docs, which (now) sends you to [a deleted page](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042654251-National-Emergency-Library-FAQs), and the contemporary version in the Internet Archive's own Wayback Machine buries the solution about eighty percent down the page, only to suggest that you e-mail them and ask; it took **three hops** (ignoring my needing to dig through old versions of pages) and a lot of reading to find that, shortly before begging for cryptocurrency and (now-defunct) Amazon Smile donations.

[^1]:  They probably thought about it earlier than that, because the Internet Archive partners with Better World, in itself somewhat shady dealing.  What other library do you know that cuts affiliate deals with book stores?

They then ask you to spread the word, even recommending that you mandate books available through them in classes that you might teach.  About a week later, they seemed to already know that they caused problems, because they tried to [spin the reactions](https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/30/internet-archive-responds-why-we-released-the-national-emergency-library/).  I want to call one line out in particular, here.

 > On March 17, the American Library Association Executive Board took the extraordinary step to [recommend that the nation’s libraries close](http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2020/03/ala-executive-board-recommends-closing-libraries-public) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

They call this "a tremendous and historic outage," because how *dare* libraries protect their staff and their communities by refusing to become places to spread a deadly illness, right?  New York City had freezer trucks to hold the overflow of dead bodies, but people should still congregate indoors, I guess.  More to the point, they wanted to stand on the side of history with the creeps angry that they couldn't harass waitresses at TGI Fridays for a few weeks.

They also play fast and loose with the truth, such as the following responses to straw-men attacks.

 > **One of the statements suggests you’ve acquired your books illegally. Is that true?**  
 >
 > No. The books in the National Emergency Library have been acquired through purchase or donation, just like a traditional library.  The Internet Archive preserves and digitizes the books it owns and makes those scans available for users to borrow online, normally one at a time.  That borrowing threshold has been suspended through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency.

Nobody has *ever* claimed that the Internet Archive...I don't know, masked up to knock over a Barnes and Noble.  They use this silly idea that they might have stolen property to deflect from their admission that "The Internet Archive...digitizes the books it owns and makes those scans available for users to borrow online."  I don't know how to say it clearer than they do, because this openly states that they copy books to publish them, precisely what every version of copyright law says that you may not do without permission.  We can argue about enforcement, term lengths, and so forth, but I don't think that anybody can reasonably dispute that copyright deliberately grants a monopoly on publishing a work, the right to copy.

I use the word "publish," here, because courts generally use a definition of publication that looks like making a work available to the public for acquisition.  Handing out copies of a book to a limited circle of friends doesn't count, for example.  As mentioned, though, the Internet Archive asked us all to spread the word, and even push people into participating.  Remember, they outright requested that educators "...teach using books from the National Emergency Library," effectively making their service a soft requirement for students, so they absolutely meant to push this as far as they could.

They claim that this all makes perfect legal sense, because...somebody at NYU published a white-paper.  No, seriously, they claim that "the legal basis" for their digital lending comes from the [Controlled Digital Lending](https://controlleddigitallending.org/) model, which doesn't actually say anything about the legality of doing it *today*, but rather presents a hypothetical model that they believe would operate carefully enough to abide by the letter of the law.  They also occasionally cite [17 USC 121](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/121) allowing teachers to make copies of material for students and others to adapt texts for the visually impaired.

None of that matters, though, because the Emergency Library explicitly existed to remove their self-imposed restrictions.  More interestingly, as you can see in the comments of almost every one of their blog posts about the National Emergency Library, they defend the project with the Controlled Digital Lending argument, even though *they suspended the "controlled" parts* of the digital lending for the duration of the emergency, specifically the second of only three **core principals**.

 > The library must maintain an "owned to loaned" ratio, simultaneously lending no more copies than it legally owns.

I've loosely followed the case since they announced the lawsuit, mentioning it in [an early Social Media Roundup post]({% post_url 2020-06-19-week %}).

 > [<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1272514695866408960) [It’s Time to Archive the Internet Archive](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dzg8n/archiving-the-internet-archive-sued-by-publishers) from VICE Motherboard
 >
 > The move puts one of the internet’s largest repositories of knowledge in peril.

And I commented on it then.

 > As the article points out, there's *nothing* like the Internet Archive around, and it's been taking increasing risks.  My specific concern about the "Emergency Library" is specifically that it had nothing to do with the pandemic on the surface, instead making its messaging about popular novels.
 >
 > Had they limited their selection to textbooks and works of importance, nobody would have raised an eyebrow.

I'll get back to this idea later.

Anyway, because this didn't go well, they announced the [early termination](https://blog.archive.org/2020/06/10/temporary-national-emergency-library-to-close-2-weeks-early-returning-to-traditional-controlled-digital-lending/) of the project.  In it, they make a wild claim.

 > The complaint attacks the concept of any library owning and lending digital books, challenging the very idea of what a library is in the digital world.

Except that it didn't.  The publishers [made the argument](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23723923-hachette-v-internet-archive-ruling) that the Internet Archive started (in 2018) "pooling" its collections with other libraries, gets a cut when sending people to Better World Books, and (through the Emergency Library) took it upon itself to act as an arbiter of how libraries and copyright should function, by making popular works---even many with no academic purpose---available on demand.  Notice that the Internet Archive *never* links to the actual complaint.  They blog about it often, and will link to their various responses to part of it, but the lawsuit itself and the text of the complaint never show up in their writing, that I can see.  They only ever characterize it as an attack on the broadest concept of libraries or try to misdirect by pointing at the Controlled Digital Libraries page or talking about how they legally acquired every physical book.

The Internet Archive countered the actual complaint by claiming that making copies of other people's books for distribution---again, *literally* the one action that every copyright law in history has always forbidden---fell under Fair Use, because the [Copyright Act of 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976) uses the word "teaching" as an example of Fair Use doctrine.  The Internet Archive doesn't teach, though.  It, at best, enables others to teach.

In any case, the judge---rightly, once you read through everything---ruled in favor of the publishers.  The Internet Archive appealed the decision.  And now the [appeals court has upheld the original decision](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hachette-v-Internet-Archive-Second-Circuit-Appeals-Court-Decision-9-4-2024.pdf).

### Quick Digression

This entire situation reminds me a lot of the lawsuit that brought down [Locast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locast).  They looked at the law and created a service that sat squarely inside the legal exceptions to re-transmitting broadcast television.

Locast *could* stream broadcast stations in a particular market---the New York metropolitan area, in their case---because not everybody can access the over-the-air signal.  They didn't outright charge, which meant that they shouldn't have profited from the content that they recycled.  Specifically, [17 U.S.C. 111(a)(5)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/111), which explicitly limits any monetary exchanges to...

 > ...assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission service.

However, they made monthly donations more central to using the service, and that brought in so much money that they expanded to dozens of other markets, which sounds like they took in semi-mandatory donations far in excess of "actual and reasonable costs."  At that point, they crossed the line while still trying to defend themselves with the no-longer-relevant legal exceptions.  Oh, and they allowed users to switch markets at will.

And like in that case, people reacted to slanted retellings of the story, such as groups like the EFF claim that the court [reads the law in an absurdly narrow way](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/court-ruling-against-locast-gets-law-wrong-lets-giant-broadcast-networks-control), even though the text of the law outright says that you can't turn a profit and must only provide transmissions to the people who could theoretically receive them.  Everybody got angry at the courts, rather than at Locast for sabotaging a working model.

## When Good Archives Go Bad

I mentioned above that many people, including myself, feel inclined to see the Internet Archive as some sort of public service.  And when posting about the Hachette case in 2020, I talked about their taking unwarranted risks like this.

At heart, while we talk about the Archive as public infrastructure, they pitch themselves as a public library, but neither idea describes them.  They have private (non-profit) ownership, so they make as much sense as public infrastructure as {% x %} does.  Meanwhile, public libraries take their funding from taxes, have a mandate to serve the public interest, stay accessible to all, can't mandate use of their service, and charge no fees.

The Archive doesn't have the first two or three qualities of a library, as a private non-profit organization.  They do run a library, yes, but don't fit the definition of a *public* library, despite their marketing.  And the problem starts there.

Fundamentally, the Archive exists as an activist organization, not a library.  Their [about page](https://archive.org/about) hints at it.

 > Our mission is to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.

That doesn't really sound like a public library's mission, does it?  Can you imagine your town librarian talking about "all knowledge" and "universal access" (not in the "ramps and large-print" sense) like this?  And by the way, I can't find a formal mission statement from them, of the sort that you'd expect from any organization that would like your money, so we don't get anything more detailed than this Silicon Valley *dominate-the-market* blurb that sounds much more like [information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free) or selling mass surveillance than running a public library.

By contrast, compare this blurb with the [mission statement of the New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/mission), which starts here.

 > The mission of The New York Public Library is to inspire lifelong learning, advance knowledge, and strengthen our communities.

And then it goes on for another *two hundred words*, explaining the parts that go into achieving that mission, none of which talks in universalities and has far more of an interest in community.  Your public library almost certainly talks more like this than the other.

As a [501(c)(3) organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29%283%29_organization), the Archive can't perform much lobbying and can't involve themselves in elections at all, if they don't want to risk (permanently) losing their non-profit status.  But that doesn't mean that they need to stay apolitical, nor should they, honestly.

## The Internet Archive and Copyright

However, when you look at their political positions and how they advocate for them---this case serving as a prime example---we start to see that their approach increasingly puts them at odds with users, because their vision of an open Internet includes dismantling copyright law, which puts them at risk when they try to make that happen without lobbying.

### Live Music

From its earliest days in the public eye, the Archive seemed interested in pushing the bounds of copyright.  I can remember, for example, when I first started noticing the site, they'd make a big deal about what they now call the [Live Music Archive](https://archive.org/details/etree?page=3).  This falls into a "gray area" of copyright law, because copyright covers *fixed works*.  Live performances sit more on the ephemeral side, with no identifiable artifact that you can point at.

If you've ever wondered why certain venues or artists forbid recording, they do it because of this hole in the law.  While never tested in courts, to my knowledge, the theory goes that, since you can't copyright a performance, the copyright to the recording goes exclusively to the people who made the physical recording.

That seems laughable, though, when you think about it.  After all, the recording creates a derivative work of the under-copyright material used in the concert, such as the songs, so those copyright holders need to have a stake in what you can do with your "capture" of it.  In 2005, the majority of the Grateful Dead[^3] pointed this issue out, and objected to the pervasive appearance of their songs in that archive.  The IA patched things up by [pretending that they misunderstood everybody's intentions](https://archive.org/post/49553/good-news-and-an-apology-gd-on-the-internet-archive).

[^3]:  Maybe ironic, since a lot of Silicon Valley philosophy either comes from or finds itself encapsulated in John Perry Barlow's pearl-clutching libertarian tripe, [*A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace*](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).  And you can find [references to Barlow](https://blog.archive.org/2018/04/24/highlights-from-the-tribute-to-cyberspace-philosopher-john-perry-barlow/) across the Archive, so don't think that lines like "your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us" don't influence their actions.

### Orphan Works

Trawling through their blog for this post, I found [this gem on the failed "Orphan Works" case](https://blog.archive.org/2007/01/22/orphan-works-appeal-rejected/) and (implicitly) the associated bills.  To me, this complaint exposes the problem plainly, so bear with me as I try to lay out what I have in my head.  You see, copyright law gets a little weird in its implementation, in that the copyright holder needs to notice your infringement, ask you to stop, maybe try to get your publisher (or service provider) to shut you down, and then they sue.  This leads to a lot of folklore about copyright, where people assume that they can exploit a work, because X, Y, and Z have all exploited it without the copyright holder complaining.

I outlined the process of [determining a work's copyright status]({% post_url 2020-07-19-pdomain %}) early on in the blog.  I laid out the steps, there, in part to make the point that you can never completely prove that a given work has *definitely* fallen into the public domain, until its renewed copyright expires.  Until then, you might always miss some associated work/creator or overlook an incorrectly transcribed renewal.  Because you can never reach complete assurance that something has fallen into the public domain, you have the idea of Orphan Works.

In the most generous interpretation, advocates call a work [orphaned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_work) when nobody can work out who owns the copyright to it or nobody can figure out how to contact that person.  In practice, though, the argument looks more like searching taking more work than the person wants to expend.  Legally, orphan works don't actually matter, because the copyright stands.  As in general the case outlined above, if the owner discovers that you've exploited the work without their permission, they can try to sue you, exactly like the person who you can find with no trouble.

Many advocates, such as Kahle in this case, [argue that Orphan Works should work](https://web.archive.org/web/20070125012122/https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/1FABEA163F4C714A8825726B005A12F0/%24file/0417434.pdf) like works in the public domain, at least until the owners come forward to prove their ownership and provide everybody with contact information.  If they stopped short of locating you, they say, then copyright law shouldn't give you permission to sue them, because otherwise "the difficulty and expense of obtaining permission to place those works on the Internet is overwhelming."

Notice that the first part already sounds like copyright law.  Somebody needs to notice the problem and care enough to sue you.  The second part, though, favors *exactly* the wrong people.  It favors large organizations cutting corners to get faux-public domain content out the door quickly and paying penalties when somebody catches them, while the random blogger or other small publisher will still need to haul into court to prove that they did sufficient research and tried to reach out, and answering questions about why they looked in these places but not those, or why they didn't expend more effort on the search.

And by the way, the entire premise makes no sense.  No other thinking in any body of law says that you should get what you want if following the law becomes tiresome or confusing.  Your debt doesn't vanish or go on hiatus because you didn't receive the payment notices.  You don't get to drive at whatever speed you feel like if a truck obstructs your vision of the speed limit sign.  And you don't get to walk around your local downtown nude because you ran out of time to do laundry.

### Assorted Other Incidents

In 2012, they---as did many other major sites, in fairness, but I include it for the overall narrative---[protested two anti-piracy bills](https://blog.archive.org/2012/01/17/12-hours-dark-internet-archive-vs-censorship/) by going dark for half the day.  However, they also don't put much work into screening uploads, meaning that they have hosted a variety of [violent extremist content](https://www.counterextremism.com/blog/dark-side-internet-archive), [criminal communication](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27044234), [literature that the far-right can't access elsewhere](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2023.2191905), and (bringing this back around to copyright itself) outright copyright violations, such as rips of DVDs.

In 2016, the Archive proudly hosted an archive of (then recently defunct) **Nintendo Power** magazine, even soliciting users to scan and upload their copies of issues not yet archived, until [Nintendo noticed and demanded that they stop](https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/8/12405278/nintendo-power-issues-disappear-from-free-online-archive).

Their [Great 78 Project](https://great78.archive.org/) still proudly runs, soliciting your old record for digitization and distribution *before* they fall into the public domain by the rules of the [Music Modernization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Modernization_Act).  Unlike the aforementioned concerts, sound recordings have always had copyright protection, though we didn't have a law until 2018 that identified term lengths.  Here, the Internet Archive decided, at least a year before the law passed, that they could copy and publish---again, the specific thing that copyright law tells you not to do---music up to an arbitrary date without permission of the copyright holders.  You might recall almost exactly the same music-copyright-doesn't-matter approach in [**Sita Sings the Blues**]({% post_url 2021-11-06-sita %}) almost a decade earlier, though on a much smaller scale and driven by ignorance of the law.  Unsurprisingly, [the major music publishers sued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-12/sony-other-music-labels-sue-over-sinatra-78s-stored-online#xj4y7vzkg), with the Internet Archive claiming---I kid you not---that they had an obligation to [preserve the imperfections](https://completemusicupdate.com/internet-archives-crackle-based-fair-use-defence-in-copyright-case-is-perverted-say-labels/), and publishing entire catalogs worth of music...well, you can't make an omelette without some crackles and pops in the eggshell, I think they say.

They've done similar things with [Bollywood films](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40875528), [BBC documentaries](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet-archive-takes-down-upload-of-bbcs-modi-documentary/article66425460.ece), and more.

And we have the National Emergency Library on that list, too.  And you can see the pattern, I hope.  Time after time, the Internet Archive assumes that they have a mandate to publish other people's works, then cries foul when the copyright holders tell them to stop violating their copyright.  At this point, we can't assume that it happens accidentally, because it happens so often.  They deliberately choose works to publish---and publicize that publication---rather than lend, that will draw the attention and ire of famously litigious organizations, such as Nintendo, the major music publishers, and the major book publishers.

### Similar Tactics

You might recognize this approach used by far-right legislators in the United States to agitate for legal change.  They have done this, increasingly, with abortion laws.

They start the process, knowing that they'll face backlash, by passing a law that *definitely* violates the Constitution.  Then, they'll let the courts rule it unconstitutional, and try to keep appealing it, until they can get it in front of the Supreme Court, hoping that the packed majority will use "originalism" and "textualism" to say that the Constitution probably meant something entirely different when Jesus wrote it on the *Mayflower*---quoting a team of medieval English witch-hunters and an extremely anti-Semitic cartoon---and so the entire country will now needs to follow the bad law from some tiny town in the middle of nowhere.

And as they do this, it keeps the idea in the media that they might get what they want.

Not every case gets that far, because even Alito and Thomas have *some* shame, but this feels like the goal, doing bad things specifically so that they can try to escalate things and milk as much publicity out of this as they can.

## The Upshot

And you know, I might not fault the Internet Archive for adapting this process, if they didn't *also*---as we've seen above---constantly lie about their cases and use their slanted descriptions of things for fund-raising.

They try to assemble a parallel version of copyright law, where they seem to constantly try to imagine their streaming/download service as part friend excited to lend out a book to another friend, part used book shopper, part public library, and no parts private organization streaming content to anybody who wants it.  Then, whenever the threat of a lawsuit arises, they warn that Big Media wants to endanger community uploads and the Wayback Machine, not to mention public libraries, and beg for money on blurring those distinctions.

## Copyright Again, Though

And yes, American copyright law definitely has huge problems.  We've gone from a situation where you could optionally control access to your work for fourteen or---if you filed extra paperwork on time---twenty-eight years, to a situation where you definitely need to control access to your work for not only your lifetime, but probably through the lives of any grandchildren who you might have.  We've done this as technology has made it far easier for people to create things that they may not care about for decades to come.  And we have laws that allow people (mostly companies) wrap public domain content in such a way that extracting it to share becomes a copyright violation.  But I don't think that we solve those problems by giving companies case studies for why they "need" laws with stronger penalties for infringement.

{% pull their reality as a move fast and break things Silicon Valley startup %}

Like I said, I always feel tempted to think of the Internet Archive as a public service, and that hides their reality as a [move fast and break things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_fast_and_break_things) Silicon Valley startup, but one that you can donate to and deduct it on your tax forms.  The things that they "break" give publishers exactly the ammunition that they need to run to Congress to give them more authority to enforce copyright.  The Internet Archive keeps claiming that publishers want to shut down public libraries, but we don't *see that happening*...we might, though, if they keep giving governments reasons to help publishers shut down whoever they think costs them money.

And while I still use the Archive a lot, and trust them far more than the "Big Five"---Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft---I can think of few organizations that I'd trust *less* than any of the Big Five or any expansion of that group.  I don't want to call for them to go away, but I do wish that we had alternatives that didn't have troubling ownership and cared far more about stability than getting into fights with big corporations.

The post's title comes from this idea, by the way.  The Internet Archive states its mission, as I quoted above, as "provid[ing] Universal Access to All Knowledge."  But they keep putting that Knowledge at risk by overtly breaking copyright law, then turning around to beg for money because of the "unfair" attacks on their illegal plans.  They want to provide access, but keep forcing others to threaten that access, and I wish that would stop.

## Also, Wikipedia

I want to mention in passing that Wikipedia gets caught in far worse lawsuits, as I brought up in a [social media roundup post from April]({% post_url 2024-04-19-week %}), and we mostly ignore them.

It amazes me how much work Wikimedia does to keep the Internet working as expected, while the Internet Archive gets all the press for mostly only arguing against copyright.  While the Archive always talks like they've fallen under literal siege and wants you to give them thirty dollars a month[^2], whereas the Wikimedia Foundation asks for far lower amounts and happily tells you where the money goes.

[^2]:  I donated a couple of times, years back, and stopped because of this aggressive copyright nonsense, *but* I still get the constant barrage of fund-raising e-mails, and believe that I saw a plea for thirty-per-month recently.

I don't want to imply that Wikipedia and its associated projects couldn't stand some improvement, because they could, but I do want to make the point that they get almost no attention (or money) for needing to stand in similar fights as the Internet Archive, but do illegal things significantly less often.

Or put another way, enjoy and---if you must---maybe even support the Internet Archive, but stop treating them like a public service, and *please* stop taking their word for it when they rant about somebody new trying to destroy libraries.
