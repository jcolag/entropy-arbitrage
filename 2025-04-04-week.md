As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > While the assertion that these issues are facets of the greater class struggle is correct, it neglects the elephant in the room: can we truly trust that a new government, even one borne from revolutionary fervor, will not perpetuate the very discrimination it aims to dismantle?

Not that we don't have other places for our focus, but the Kenyan situation definitely warrants watching.

I would also note that the Republican alliance seems to have already started fracturing, with Republican politicians conceding points to journalists rather than stonewalling, and the administration backing down repeatedly.  They've done and will continue to do a lot of damage, but it doesn't seem like they'll have much luck making a lasting impact.

Even in my more temperate regions, when we have inclement weather, I only half-joke when I tell people that I'll flee the area if the electricity goes out.  Everything relies on a stable power grid, and while we haven't seen the price hikes that others see, I can't really trust any company who can default of Lily Tomlin's old line of "we're the phone company; we don't have to care."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics, specifically people using non-government apps to plan military action %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Seven Reasons Trumpâ€™s Entire National Security Team Should Resign in Disgrace](https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/03/25/seven-reasons-trumps-entire-national-security-team-should-resign-in-disgrace/) from Empty Wheel

 > But now that Trump has told the lie, he has also claimed that after his entire national security team learned that a journalist may have witnessed them engage in behavior that might violate the Espionage Act, none of them told him â€” not JD Vance, not Mike Waltz, not Susie Wiles, not the NSC spox who gave on the record confirmation that the thread was authentic â€” none of them alerted Trump to the breach. Trump would further have you believe that none of them told him â€” not JD Vance, not Mike Waltz, not Susie Wiles, not the NSC spox who gave on the record confirmation that the thread was authentic â€” that an incredibly damaging story was about to drop.

I have to admit to some amusement in watching these nitwits scramble to try to downplay a complete failure at the only legitimate government function that they actually care about.  Let he who has never butt-dialed detailed military information to a journalist while trying to evade accountability by using public networks instead of purpose-designed systems cast the first stone, they insist.  Rookies need time to learn how to not publish secret information, they say.  And no, they keep the elected head of state out of all the important conversations, they admit, and let him find out about it on Fox News like any doddering fascist with dementia should...
