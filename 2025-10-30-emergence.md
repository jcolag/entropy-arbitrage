In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Emergence

Since our last post, **Deep Space Nine** started to untangle the background of plain, simple Garak, with the best line in that vein, in *The Wire*...no relation to the 2002 TV series, as far as I know.  By contrast, this episode will also try to say something about truth and fiction, but not really.  Especially the lies hold true, though, so what do I know...?

 > **DATA**: Graves at my command have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth by my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and when I have required some heavenly music, which even now I do, to work mine end upon their senses, that this airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, bury it certain fathoms in the earth, and deeper than did ever plummet sound, I'll---Captain? Sir, your attention is wandering.

Tediously, we start with [**The Tempest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest), Act V, Scene I, and in a first for the series, not even working from a clean breaking point.  Data will mention this later in the scene, because apparently the computer can't figure out that when he adjusts his set, he means for the current scene.

 > **PICARD**: Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of the Renaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himself in a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him here about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever.

How does the modern saying go?  "Tell me that you don't understand history without telling me that you don't understand history"?

Sure, the (second) [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance) more or less stretched through Shakespeare's life, and most people consider it to have ended roughly around his death, though quite a few historians advocate stretching the dates by about a century on either end.  But far from the romanticized thoughts that the era has in popular culture of a modernist culture spontaneously emerging, the Renaissance mostly involved reviving ideas and designs from the so-called European [classical era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity) (mostly Ancient Greece[^ZNSVTq] and Rome), hence the name, and also, the identification of a specific named era didn't really have much currency until the mid-nineteenth century.

[^ZNSVTq]:  Especially given that the era didn't become particularly important until the 1830s, I strongly suspect that the interest in Ancient Greece in particular made it cleaner to try to draw a line from Athenian democracy to modern democracies, and ignore the whole bit where the United States in particular cribbed much of its design from Native American tribal federations, since you'll notice that the 1830s happens to land right at the height of the ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Native American population.

In other words, Shakespeare didn't see himself standing at the end of a global era, nor did he see some looming future.  When he staged **The Tempest**, however, he did stand near the end of his own life, a cusp of a different sort, which makes far more sense as an interpretation.

Interestingly, Picard *could* have made this work---had Shakespeare written about people traveling the world---because the play does come near the end of the so-called [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery).  Over the course of the writer's life, maps went from mystery continents and (especially in the New World) amorphous shapes to maps that you'd mostly recognize today, as we charted almost the remainder of the planet.

![World maps in 1572 and 1602](/blog/assets/world-maps-1572-1602.png "Ignoring for a moment the atrocities committed on the way around the world, I do have to admit that they did do a thorough job...")

Really, though, the line and the entire scene exists because Picard has (I guess) looked at the show's shooting schedule and noticed that they don't have an eighth season coming.  The writers find themselves with their "powers" no longer needed, at least no more than three hours of it, so *they* perform one final (self-indulgently) creative act...before the other[^cEh-p_] big self-indulgent episode(s).

[^cEh-p_]:  "If you gaze long into your navel, the navel also gazes into you," I suppose the episode warns us...

 > **DATA**: The train we encountered was from one of Doctor Crusher's holodeck programs. It was a re-creation of the *Orient Express*, a train which travelled from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth century until---
 >
 > **PICARD**: Yes, yes, Data, I know about the *Orient Express*. But what is it doing on Prospero's Island?

Picard cuts Data off, both because he presumably asked for an explanation in order to cut him off *and* because the writers wouldn't have known that the [*Orient Express*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express) would make its final journey in 2009.

 > **PICARD**: I never realized that you were interested in trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the *Orient Express* carried more than ten thousand people a year?

What a weirdo.  First, I absolutely guarantee that Picard *also* didn't know that until the trip between the holodeck and sickbay, so that he could make it clear that he has rifled through her digital belongings, previously indicated to often contain intimately private thoughts.

And second, does he believe that Data has a strong interest in torches because they appeared in his **Tempest** set?  While Crusher comes up with a different explanation, does "guy who moonlights as a hard-boiled detective" not realize that the train provides the setting or plot device for dozens of stories, most famously Agatha Christie's *Have You Got Everything You Want?* from 1933 and **Murder on the Orient Express** a year later, well within their only-the-1930s-matters view of popular culture?

 > Captain's log, stardate 47869.2. After weathering an unexpected magnascopic storm in the Mekorda Sector, we are continuing our search for new Federation colony sites.

I can't help noticing that, close on the heels of ceding territory to the Cardassians in [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}), now they suddenly need to hunt for colony worlds again.

 > **RIKER**: Whatever's going on, our first priority is getting back control of the ship.

I mean...if they had control of the ship a couple of scenes back, they would've all died, so maybe adjust those priorities a bit?  You have to admit that a ship that actively protects its crew could prove useful.

 > **RIKER**: This should be interesting.

And yet...not so much.

 > **CONDUCTOR**: Tickets! Tickets please. Please have your tickets ready. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Tickets please.

Probably not, but you might recognize the conductor as [David Huddleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Huddleston), who made the rounds for decades...

 > **DATA**: Unlikely as it may sound, I believe that the *Enterprise* may be forming an intelligence.

If only they had some warning, such as the ship's computer creating intelligent, conscious personalities repeatedly for the last seven years...

 > **DATA**: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But that description does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property.

*Somebody* wants VC funding for hypothetical future products that he doesn't know how to create...

 > **PICARD**: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along. See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being.

That doesn't bode well for the emerging intelligence...

 > **WORF**: Do you recognize it?
 >
 > **TROI**: No.

What?  Why the Hell not?  She made such a big deal about looking for clues in the fantasy images, but didn't bother to look at the node-things that Data and La Forge found all over the ship?

 > **TROI**: I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an important clue.

I think that I might actually hate this show, at this point...

Anyway, when they get off, we find them on some alternate-universe New York City (calling out four out of five boroughs) that doesn't have named subway lines on a "New York City Transit System" that somehow uses the [Metropolitan Transit Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority)'s logo contemporary to the episode up on the post.  But the sign *also* calls out the [Interborough Rapid Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interborough_Rapid_Transit_Company) system, and its [Broadway-Seventh Avenue line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Broadway%E2%80%93Seventh_Avenue_Line).  I shouldn't have paused that scene; my head actually hurts from that mess.  You'd think that whoever built the subway entrance could've rolled with any of the three and not had any issues, but somehow, somebody at Paramount---I assume that they filmed this on some corporate back lot---decided to signal the existing organization, its defunct predecessor, *and* (I believe) a complete fiction.

 > **LAFORGE**: I wish I could tell you.

Again, what?  Did I hallucinate the part of the episode where they talked about finding things that looked like this all over the ship?  Like with Troi, I feel like everybody should recognize the design at this point, even if they haven't worked out the purpose.

 > **TROI**: The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was having some kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolically it probably does have some kind of logic to it.

It doesn't make literal sense except for the part where they keep *making things that look like the thing that the ship started making*.  They sent in the professional therapist---she *volunteered*---to get this worked out, remember, and she can't come up with anything better than maybe they can find a metaphor...

 > **TROI**: I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them are genuinely unaware of what's going on. It's as though this emergent intelligence is like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figure itself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on is ours through our holodeck programs.

You'll notice how quickly that she has dismissed forming a real communication.

 > **PICARD**: Very well, Counselor, go ahead. But bear in mind that whenever we have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's time to cooperate with them.

...Yes?  But, like, half an hour ago?  Again, this intelligence, as far as they know, took control of the ship to save their lives, and only really put their schedule in danger up until an emergency emerged for them.

 > **CRUSHER**: There are some species whose sole purpose is to reproduce. Once they finally procreate, they die.

Notice more of that weird religious nonsense, here the idea that some creatures have a "purpose."  Also, not to keep banging on the drum, but the computer routinely creates consciousness, so *maybe* the computer's "life" doesn't die at all.

 > **PICARD**: The intelligence that was formed on the *Enterprise* didn't just come out of the ship's systems. It came from us. From our mission records, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. Now, if our experiences with the *Enterprise* have been honorable, can't we trust that the sum of those experiences will be the same?

OK, but does he not remember the time(s) that he has tried to trick the conscious holodeck characters into giving up on their needs, starting with [*The Big Goodbye*]({% post_url 2022-08-04-big-goodbye %}) and most prominently in [*Ship in a Bottle*]({% post_url 2025-02-06-ship-in-bottle %})?  Also, Data must have watched a completely different episode to the one that I saw, because Picard really didn't have a choice in my version.  You might also recall that the computer blocked every attempt to stop it, eventually resorting to threatening the ship, and then put them in a situation where they'd run out of oxygen two hours into a twelve-hour trip...

## Conclusions

We get more Shakespeare and dubious history, but not a lot else.

### The Good

They do at least pay lip service to respecting living creatures.

### The Bad

Picard goes out of his way to show that he has violated a colleague's privacy, trying to make it seem like flirty small talk.  He also does a *terrible* job of it, presuming that the setting of a fantasy suggests a desire to work there.

They continue to obsess over control, especially control over novel forms of life and freedom from their control.  This holds even when that life has saved their lives.  They also continue to resist acknowledging the consciousness that has manifested in their computers, and show no interest in trying to communicate, only reluctantly trying to find a cooperative solution.

The crew consistently shows a lack of preparation, especially in recognizing the designs appearing in every aspect of the scenario as potentially related.

At least some of them believe that some people and even cultures have some defined purpose to fulfill.

### The Weird

The Federation has returned to prioritizing colonization of planets.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the show tries its damnedest to look like **Deep Space Nine**, in *Preemptive Strike*.
