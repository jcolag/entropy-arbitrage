As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 12 February 2024

Events conspired to push me into skipping the day.

## 9:06 -- Tue 13 February 2024

 > The study highlights middle age as an important time to adjust our sleep habits in ways that may help protect our brain health.

Personally, I rarely do well in the short term if I don't sleep well---if I oversleep, it usually means that I've gotten sick and can expect worse symptoms---so this doesn't surprise much, except for the magnitude of the problem.

We definitely need more of this in the world.

I've always had similar concerns about the Gershwins' work, certainly *good* and evocative of the intent, but so often convincing people to overlook the precursors to his work.

This definitely seems like the wrong direction, but for predictable reasons in a world where we can't talk about underlying causes.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > ‚ÄúThis not only tells us that people were moving according to needs for farming and herding‚Äîwhich was largely influenced by environmental potential‚Äîbut that mobility was key for building social relationships and the regional character of ancient communities on the Tibetan Plateau.‚Äù

This fascinates me to no end, even though it *probably* shouldn't...

 > A dedicated team, consisting of people from both WLF and Project Korikath supports the toolkit, ensuring ongoing recruitment, future developments, and maintenance as needed. This approach aims to prevent the initiative from lacking proper attention and accumulating technical debt.

This looks like a great project, and I'll need to dig deeper at some point.
