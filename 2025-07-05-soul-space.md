This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **Soul Space**.

![An adaptation of a fifteenth century Russian Orthodox icon representing the Transfiguration of Jesus, but with the colors boosted and shadows deepened to suggest a comic book interpretation](/blog/assets/Transfiguration-by-Feofan-Grek.png "If you don't want me to hack out an imaginary cover, then you probably want to find something for yourself...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Soul Space**
 * Location:  <https://covok.itch.io/soul-space-a-christian-mysticism-sci-fi-setting-that-is-open-for-anyone-to-use>
 * Released:  2024
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Kamala Kara Arroyo
 * Medium:  Role-playing reference
 * Length:  Approximately fifteen thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Religious themes, deliberately played with, one possibly ableist idea

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Soul Space

The Itch page describes the games as follows.

> Soul Space is a Christian Mysticism science fiction setting inspired by works like Xenogears and Xenosaga. It is a possible taboo setting that takes Christian elements out of their original cultural context to create a science fiction universe.
>
> This document is a brief overview of the premise, some key elements, and an overall idea. It gives you some key events, a basic history, and some key factions. It was designed a for a tabletop game, but it's a setting, so it can be used for anything you desire.
>
> This document is on creative commons-attribution-commercial. You are free to use its contents to make your product for commercial use and I cannot legally contest it.
>
> This is something I wanted to start for a while. Putting out settings and worlds for anyone to use without worrying about copyright. There is a larger project I have in the works where I want to do something similar, and I thought a trial run would make sense. Since I was making this for a game, I thought I'd put it out and see what the reception is like before moving forward with the much larger plan.
>
> Then again, probably no one will care. Still, I wanted to do it.

I learned about the project (and Arroyo) on late, lamented Cohost, by the way.  I have no experience with this genre, so I can't honestly tell you if it feels like a plausible take on things.

## What Works Well?

Whether it comes directly from this book or the book recycles it from other sources, I appreciate the angle on the premise suggested (in passing) during the introduction.

> During the 1990s, it became common [in Japan] to use Christian iconography and loose understandings of the religion as a method of adding exoticism to a work.

Given how often Western culture has misappropriated aspects of other cultures as little more than a way to identify a character as exotic or strange, it only makes sense for works to appropriate Western culture for the same reason.

The world has its heart in the right place, I think, and comes at a fairly good time in history.  I don't say that because of the Christian mythology angle.  Rather, I say that because it uses that as a vehicle to talk about---as the final section calls out in a nicer bulleted list---religions perverted for hatred, capitalism destroying everything, and democracies failing because society failed to protect them from capture by the powerful.

And overall, it feels like a fun world to play around in.  I can even see (probably unintentional, but I don't know) parallels to more famous, proprietary science fiction franchises that a clever person could probably exploit without looking too transparent.  You have your failing democracy dealing with issues that (as mentioned) look suspiciously like some of our own today[^1].  You have a galaxy where aliens, even the dangerous monsters, (probably) have recent origins as modified humans, and most people have forgotten Earth entirely[^2].  Then, you have space-marines who defend humanity from inside the cockpits of giant robots[^3].  You even have an artificial and often abused slave race on the verge of an uprising that could potentially drive humanity from its home[^4].  Nudge the focus of the storytelling in one direction or another, and you have a setting that suddenly accommodates an unexpected class of stories, kept firmly in the **Soul Space** setting with a sprinkling of Christian mysticism.

[^1]:  Maybe think of a certain wildly popular Amazon-produced adaptation of an (ahem) expansive book series, here, or even a fan-favorite "novel for television" drawing heavily from (ahem) Babylonian mythology.

[^2]:  Imagine something running for one season and a movie, maybe, by a creator that nobody really wants to talk about anymore---I certainly don't---and probably not as worth rewatching as memories might indicate, given its often ill-advised politics...

[^3]:  Think of a wide variety of classic anime.

[^4]:  Consider a certain television series created as (almost) a knock-off of one of the most successful films at the time, occasionally drawing from Mormon mythology and featuring a lead character named for Ahab's chief mate, then largely forgotten until a major reboot.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Some historical events, especially those with a "secret" history, feel a bit too dense.  They have too many contributing factors that seem to come out of nowhere.  And while I don't dislike the stories, I can't imagine trying to explain any of it to an audience or a gaming group.

I should note that, as something like a preview release for possible eventual expansion, you'll find typos.  While they don't show up *too* often, they happen enough to show a range from barely noticeable to understandable but never not amusing (Federation citizens have a "right to bare arms"), to one or two incomprehensible lines.  If the project had a version control repository somewhere, I'd submit a pull request instead of pointing it out, but it doesn't...

## Opportunities

Itch does have a commenting system, so you might want to thank the author and/or check out the author's other work.

## What's Adaptable?

The world has its own calendar, the Immigrant Faith with its Papal Government, the Soul Network, Wilhelm Inc., Smith-Tanaka Corp., Arcanum Animarum industries, and the zenni currency.

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll start reading **Trois écoles**, an unfinished French novel.  It runs longer than our usual fare, even in its incomplete state, so as we've done before, to prevent the discussions from taking over the blog, we'll give it a "sampling" of three weeks, covering about half the book in total, and maybe come back to the rest some other time with the other longer books.  Next week, then, we'll read the first chapter, *Anthracite, vert de viride*, roughly *Coal, Green and Flourishing* in English.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the concept?
