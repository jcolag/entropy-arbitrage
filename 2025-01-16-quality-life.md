In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Quality of Life

You know what people come to *Star Trek* for, right?  People come to *Star Trek* to watch people---apologies for the mild cultural appropriation, but the word fits so well---kibitz around a table...

 > **WORF**: Commander, is it your intention to continue to grow your beard?

This beard "subplot" started in [*The Outcast*]({% post_url 2024-09-05-outcast %}), I believe, or maybe [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %}) when La Forge offended Data by not using his perfectly efficient razor, though this particular iteration comes from [*A Fistful of Datas*]({% post_url 2025-01-09-fistful-datas %}), last week.

Also, thank goodness that nobody has anything better to do, right?  If they did, then we wouldn't get this critical poker scene that underscores the plot by illustrating...playing poker, I guess.  And it philosophizes about facial hair.

 > **RIKER**: I think it's a sign of strength.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Sure, and of course, women can't grow beards.

I really don't understand the function of these poker games.  Take this exchange, for example.  This would probably do a decent job of underscoring the plot in an episode about gender roles, by previewing or echoing plot points.  Instead, it pads the run of this episode without any relevance to the main plot.  Or rather, it does hint at part of the main plot, but not a part that the script will want to engage with.

 > **RIKER**: Well, I've always wanted to see you as a brunette.

I want to draw attention to how Riker in particular completely misses the point of the bet, *after* not noticing her needling him.  Crusher got into this to make the point that her three opponents grew beards for no greater reason than vanity.  And she has already stipulated that she (generalizing to "women") changes her appearance for the same reason.  Therefore, changing her appearance comes off more like Riker wanting to exert control over a colleague's appearance---much like he reprimanded a colleague for wearing jewelry important to her culture in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), so don't tell me that seems out of character---than proving any kind of point.

And while I need to dig through old episodes anyway, let's not forget Riker revealing his brunette fetish in [*11001001*]({% post_url 2022-08-25-11001001 %}) or that time that he shared a body with Crusher's boyfriend in [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}), creeping her out.  In that context, having her change her hair color---to the color worn by somebody that he once dated---starts to look even more controlling.

 > **FARALLON**: Well, that's why I want to increase the stream density. That should boost the lift capacity by seventy-two percent.

You might recognize the doctor as [Ellen Bry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Bry), who has appeared in some of the weirdest roles, but made her name primarily as Julie Masters in the second season of [**The Amazing Spider-Man**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_%28TV_series%29) and Shirley Daniels on [**St. Elsewhere**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere), the latter show getting an indirect mention in [*Suddenly Human*]({% post_url 2023-11-30-suddenly-human %}), probably should have other times like [*Elaan of Troyius*]({% post_url 2021-05-13-elaan %}), and will probably rear its head next week, too.

 > **FARALLON**: And will your opinion be the deciding factor?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: No, not really. I'll make my report to Captain Picard. He'll make the official recommendation to Starfleet. They'll decide.

That actually sounds more like a "yes," answer-wise.  I mean, unless they mean to solicit bribes or something, then Picard only forwards the e-mail, so to speak.

Also, he seems absurdly condescending in this conversation.

 > **PICARD**: The *Enterprise* is scheduled to leave the Tyran system tomorrow. If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a very good reason.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: I'm inclined to agree. I don't think that forty-eight hours is too much time to risk particularly when the gains are so substantial. You may proceed, Doctor.

I feel like I've raised Picard's erratic behavior in other posts, but does he have cognitive issues?  Seconds apart, he both insisted that changing his plans carries an extremely high risk, but then turns around to say that it doesn't carry much risk.  What changed his mind, the chance to see incrementally more affordable mining equipment?

 > **FARALLON**: I'm sorry. I guess I'm touchy these days.

La Forge has harassed or dismissed her whenever we saw the two of them together, so far, and *she* has to apologize for snapping at him?  This seems important, especially in comparison to [*Galaxy's Child*]({% post_url 2024-02-22-galaxy-s-child %}), where La Forge similarly wronged a female colleague, only for her to apologize for taking offense.

 > **DATA**: Why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry and repair it two hours later?
 >
 > **COMPUTER**: Unknown.

As a better question, why do they keep asking the computer questions like this?  Do they think that it has some psychic abilities?  I don't see any way for the computer to work out the cause.

 > **DATA**: Doctor, what is the definition of life?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Doctor, I appreciate your time constraints, but recognizing new life, whatever its form, is the principal mission of this vessel. Please. Now, Mister Data, will you tell us what makes you think that the exocomps are alive?

I've said it before, but seriously, somebody needs to buy this android a dictionary.

Also, does the Federation not have a specific legal definition of life?  It feels pretty necessary to their job on the ship.

Plus, the lack of a definition feels like a disaster in the making with colonial efforts.  Especially given how we've seen some of these efforts go---such as in [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %})---it seems too expedient to wipe out any native inconveniences and, if caught, fight out whether it should have qualified as living in the courts.

Mind you, *we* have definitions of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life), but they all presume organic life with biological processes.  We generally define it using the capacity for homeostasis, organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.  Another competing definition exists, but...actually, it dovetails perfectly with the next line.

 > **DATA**: Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, but both are alive.

Due to the possibility of inorganic life, as well as the large parts of an organism's life-cycle where organisms can't perform some tasks on that list---if we only had samples of elderly and infirm organisms of a class, the above definition suggests that we wouldn't call them living, because they might not respond to stimuli or reproduce, even though we'd all agree that they live---you'll often see people try to trim the list down to self-organization, the idea (pardon my simplification) that the physical form mostly creates and manages itself.

Self-organization can encompass many of the tasks on the list, *but* it calls into question whether a virus qualifies as a living organism, since they definitionally can only reproduce inside and with the processes of the cells of a host organism.  A [virion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virion) invades a cell, then *disassembles itself* so that the genetic material can hijack the cell, at which point it becomes a virus.  In other words, the virus does most of its self-organization (what passes for metabolism, reproduction, etc.) at times when you won't really identify it as a separate entity.

Because of that, not everybody agrees that a virus qualifies as life, like Data asserts here, instead thinking of them as edge-cases.  You now start to see references to "virocells" to side-step this argument, suggesting that we should consider the virally infected cell as the organism, rather than the virus or virion.

As of only last year, by the way, viruses *may* have company in their "edge of life" status, with the discovery of seemingly not viral [obelisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_%28biology%29).

 > **LAFORGE**: Then why don't we just threaten its survival again and see what happens?

Wait, *what*?  Commit violence against the novel form of life so that it can prove its value?  Surely, nobody else will---

 > **PICARD**: Make it so.

Never mind.  Yeah, OK, harming new life for kicks sounds more like Picard.

 > **DATA**: You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in the universe. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realized I might be encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility exists that I was no longer alone. For that reason, I---The exocomp has returned.

Note that, once again, Data reminds us that he feels ostracized from the community because of his (in effect) ethnicity.

Unrelated, [progenitor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/progenitor) feels like exactly the wrong word, here, doubly so, given that Farallon's clear admiration of Data probably influenced the exocomp design.

 > **RIKER**: Mister Data, you know how much I respect your judgment, but I can't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your belief. Prepare the exocomp, Doctor.

Riker repeatedly makes the point, after this, that he values his *friends* over the potential new form of life.  He even tells Data that he'd take any alternative, then refuses to let Data risk himself.

 > **DATA**: That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations, direct insubordination is a court-martial offense. But I will not release the transporter.

Hey, look, more evidence that status provides unquestioned authority:  They can convict you for refusing a blatantly immoral order.

 > **RIKER**: What does that mean? Are they willing to go or not?

It never ceases to amaze me what little attention this jerk pays to the missions.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. I thought you might want to know why I would be willing to risk your life for several small machines.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I think I understand the predicament you were in. It could not have been an easy choice.

It really bothers me that they don't have a *policy* for this.  Or maybe they do, but like the Prime Directive has shifted from "hide evidence of off-world intelligence even at the expense of our lives" to "we'll do whatever feels convenient," interpretation of how to preserve novel life has also grown less strict.

Anyway, most of you probably already know this, but by the time of **Lower Decks**, the exocomps have become Federation citizens and formed families, in case you wondered how the life question gets decided.

## Conclusions

Weirdly, we get quite a bit out of this episode, *but* not much relating to the actual plot.

### The Bad

Society conditions men to both fuss about their appearances, while also denying that it has anything to do with vanity.  Often, they frame their vanity in terms of projecting power.  They also crave controlling the appearance of women.  For their part, women feel the need to apologize for pushing back against unwarranted attacks.

We also continue to see an authoritarian streak in the culture.  Everybody treats Picard's fickle behavior as ordinary.  Starfleet can also court-martial officers for any insubordination.  And Riker continues to pay no attention to his job.

Data has returned to asking questions that he should take responsibility for working out on his own.  But similarly, the Federation seems to have no standard minimum definition of life.  And because of that, they expect life to prove itself through trials by ordeal.  They especially see it as worth enslaving and sacrificing novel life to rescue people who they care about.

Data also again expresses his sense that he doesn't fit into Federation society.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Picard runs off to play secret-agent while the rest of the crew screams permutations of "you're not my real dad" at the chief from **Cop Rock**, in *Chain of Command*, part 1.
