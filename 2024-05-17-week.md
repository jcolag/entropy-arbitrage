As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

You might notice that we currently have states going out of their way to block their children from a decent college education, and then a good job.  We don't talk about that enough, and I don't know of any legitimate solutions.

Finally.  I know that a lot of conservatives worry that funding the IRS means that they now have more risk, but this makes the clear point that *under*-funding the IRS sends them our way as fights they can win.

I grabbed Nnedi Okorafor, Casey McQuiston, and Amal El-Mohtar[^1] as a trial run, and it suggested Nghi Vo, P. Djèlí Clark, Alix E. Harrow, all solid recommendations if I didn't already know their work.  It only gave me one author who I'd call a "hard pass."[^3].  More importantly, it tossed in T. Kingfisher, Caitlin Starling, and Silvia Moreno-Garcia for me to investigate later, never heard of any of them, before I decided not to spend too much time on the one task.

Long-time readers already know some of the back-story in the footnotes, in the [post where I outlined my heritage-skewed reading plan]({% post_url 2022-07-03-reading %}), but figured that, even though they haven't released it as Free Software, it seemed worth calling out Gnooks.

Hashtags:  #Journalism #Trust

Mostly, I found the quoted sentence the most interesting, here:  Conservatives and consumers of conservative media feel more misinformed than the rest of us.  That makes sense on one hand, because conservative media *exists* to mislead people---no really, [Ailes created the plan for conservative propaganda during the Nixon administration](https://web.archive.org/web/20190330061638/https://gawker.com/5814150/roger-ailes-secret-nixon-era-blueprint-for-fox-news) and [mostly used it to air his opinions](https://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/the_birth_of_fox_news/)---but on the other hand, it seems like they could fix this with little effort, but definitely don't do that, for some reason...

The company concept seems interesting enough, but trying to hide its marketing by feeding it through public officials now makes me question how they run the overall business.

It couldn't happen to a nicer candidate, probably literally.

If he had any executive function left, he would've taken his stolen classified documents (*allegedly*, I guess) and used them to buy his way into a country where he could live in exile in 2020.  He could've run the same scams to soak his gullible followers for money and try to stoke violence, *and* he wouldn't have to put himself through this mortification of almost losing in a one-person race while also seeing his one valuable asset seized by the government that he tried to overthrow.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why Elizabeth Warren is pushing for a $500 billion transportation bill](https://www.fastcompany.com/91119418/elizabeth-warren-build-green-bill-transportation-spending) from Fast Company

 > Historically, federal transportation funds have been distributed on the basis of an 80-20 split; that is, state and local governments must pony up 20% of funds for any project. That means states that have devoted little to public transit have been eligible for less federal money to address the historic lack of investment.

Let's hope that this goes through.  Public transit has barely functioned for most of my life, outside the most concentrated population centers.  By me, for example, getting from the downtown shopping area in walking distance to the nearest one of relevance would take *over an hour* by bus, including two transfers and some waiting.  Nobody knows why we have no route the four miles down a major road.  And I live in a relatively wealthy area; a couple of towns over, the situation declines faster than the median income.

 > For decades, federal officials maligned patients and doctors who spoke out about the benefits of cannabis. One former federal drug czar even accused physicians who supported medical marijuana of practicing “Cheech & Chong medicine.”

I've probably mentioned this before, but I don't see marijuana as a personal issue, since I don't have an interest in the drug.  However, given that we know---from the words of the people making those decisions---that the misclassification of the drug has racist origins, first in the 1920s to smear Mexican workers and then under the Nixon administration to give the police a pretext to arrest Black people and anti-war protesters, *that* information makes it an important issue.

I considered writing a full post on the anniversary, but that seemed excessive last Sunday, and I didn't have *that* much to say about it.  Among the things that I *would* say, I can't actually remember when I discovered the comic---you'd think that I would have mentioned something about it in my notes as viable for adaptation, but no---so even that has nowhere to go.  But I do celebrate the comic and its success.  {% emoji party popper %} I've enjoyed the ride, and can't wait to see how it'll end, even as we see the starts of **Mini Fantasy Theater** take shape.

[^1]: A few years ago, I realized that all my favorite authors looked suspiciously like middle-aged white guys[^4], so I started taking advantage of the Libby app and assorted history/heritage months to expand my horizons.  Shockingly, it turns out that, if one puts in the bare minimum effort, one finds some pretty amazing stuff[^2]...
[^2]:  One also finds a lot of absolute trash, but hey, I read **Trilby**[^5] among plenty of other "classic" trash, many years ago, so let's not pretend that I have any actual *standards* preventing me from reading something.
[^3]:   I won't name them, because people get (probably not unreasonably) emotional about the person's work, but they (only) don't do anything for me.  And the recommendation did make intellectual sense.
[^4]:  I believe that a search like this prompted that moment of introspection, when I dutifully filled in some bland list like Douglas Adams, Miguel de Cervantes, and Robert W. Chambers or something, then scratched my head at the boring results.
[^5]:  Not about hats...y'know, as long as I've started using footnotes.
