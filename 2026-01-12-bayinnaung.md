We still don't have a holiday, but four hundred seventy-one years ago, [Bayinnaung Kyawhtin Nawrahta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayinnaung) had himself crowned King of Burma after spending a few years taking on the (other?) warlords claiming control over various regions of the nation after the former king's assassination.  He would go on to build and rule the largest Southeast Asian empire in history, but also reduced internal military conflicts by harmonizing laws and shrinking the authority of the hereditary ruling class.

And on to the week's projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-posts %}

I believe that this week went entirely to adding labels to posts.  I finished dealing with the [*Star Trek*](/blog/tag/star-trek) posts, with [**TNG** season 1](/blog/tag/st-tng-s1), the [original cast films](/blog/tag/st-film), the [animated series](/blog/tag/st-tas), and the original series [season 1](/blog/tag/st-1966-s1)[^FRcYNZ], [season 2](/blog/tag/st-1966-s2), and [season 3](/blog/tag/st-1966-s3).  In addition, wherever I missed them on the first pass, the [summaries](/blog/tag/summary) have their own tag, which could eventually include summaries of other topics.

[^FRcYNZ]:  As you might have noticed, I refuse to subtitle the original **Star Trek**, so it gets the blog-internal designation of "1966," which coincidentally does a nice job of contrasting it with the 2009 film released with the same title.

Similarly, I have started going through the [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) posts, with April through November 2025 appropriately labeled, for the most part.  I won't go through the thirty or so items, but I'll gesture at major ongoing projects such as [the blog itself](/blog/tag/blog), [the newsletter](/blog/tag/newsletter), and keeping up with [library updates](/blog/tag/library-update).  Then, posts with code segments have a label with languages such as [CSS](/blog/tag/css), [JavaScript](/blog/tag/javascript), and [Mermaid](/blog/tag/mermaid).  And then the less technical items that land in the developer diary posts, such as [Codidact answers](/blog/tag/codidact), updating my [mini-server](/blog/tag/mini-server) along with the applications that I tried out, [recipes](/blog/tag/recipe), and [stenotype practice](/blog/tag/stenotype).

## Next

While something important might come up during the week, I expect that I'll mostly spend my "discretionary time" on adding more labels to the developer diary posts.  With any luck, I'll manage to get bigger batches as I get more practiced in re-reading them after so long.

Mind you, now I wonder if the developer diary posts should also have labels representing the holiday or anniversary that I use.  As time goes on, the odds of reusing a holiday will increase, after all.  On the other hand, that would require more double-checking of spelling for everything, to make sure that another post didn't raise it...
