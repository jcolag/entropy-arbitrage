This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading **Aumyr**, from the Guardia del Lupo organization to the end.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Aumyr**
 * Location:  <https://www.aumyr.world/en/>, <https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting>
 * Released:  2019 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Marco Bertolini](https://github.com/bertolinimarco)
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately sixty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Some sexism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aumyr

The website describes the project as follows.

 > Aumyr is a fantasy setting for role-playing games, born with the aim of being free, adaptable and ready to be played. It can accommodate many types of systems (d20™, Dungeons & Dragons®, Pathfinder®, Labyrinth Lord, etc...), provided they contain classic fantasy tropes as magic and wizards, elves, dragons, dwarves, warriors and so on. For a campaign set on Aumyr, use the basic rules for your favorite role-playing game. No value is provided typical of some systems such as Armor Class, Skill, Saving Throws, Difficulty Class or other mechanics, so that it is entirely entrusted to the narrator the ability to conduct the session independently.
 >
 > ### The world is yours
 >
 > In these pages you will find only some information about world history, deities and geography: it will be up to you to give life and color to everything else. Aumyr is designed to be used both by Masters who like to schedule their own game sessions, and for those who like to improvise and let themselves be guided by roleplay. In the first case you will have several details on the setting, in the second it will be enough for the Master to take what he wants to start playing.

And it then goes on to detail more aspects of the world of Aumyr.

I should note that Bertolini wrote the book in Italian, which---like many languages---I haven't learned.  As such, I'll read this through machine translation, so the usual caveats apply that I may overlook clever turns of phrase or may not see connections that fit together in the original.  You can find a lot of the same material on the website translated to English and French, but because I want to follow a standard ordering---to know where to start and stop posts---and don't know how far the translations have progressed, I'll stick with the book.

## What Works Well?

Largely because the chapters have grown smaller and so we look at the world from a variety of different angles, the book finally has the variety that I wish that it could have had---even though I realize the difficulty of editing this to give the regions some depth while getting through as many different kinds of ideas as possible---all along.  Where previous sections sometimes felt bogged down by, for example, giving us a series of cookie-cutter sections trying to squeeze minor difference between one feudal government worshipping the major gods and another, this section churns through (I'd argue) the more interesting organizations, gives us some major background characters, lists common occupations comparable to character classes, runs through almost twenty local legends, recommends about forty candidate adventures to fit the setting, and over a dozen premises for an ongoing campaign.

Because of this, while I don't think that anybody would call every idea a *winner*, this section probably has the highest density of fun possibilities.  I almost feel like the book wants to start with the adventure/campaign ideas as a teaser, followed by the reference material.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The final sections come back to reminding us that we should find this all so interesting and that anything in the book could become an adventure.

And interestingly, while I can understand why an author might not want to do that, it seems peculiar that the book leaves the explicit adventure ideas so vague.  Let's look at an example, the first adventure seed, in fact.

 > The daughter of an old sovereign is about to inherit all her father's estate and kingdom, but instead of ruling her people, she prefers to escape from the castle and become an adventuress. The King offers a reward for anyone who can dissuade her from this crazy idea and make her return to the palace.

Ignoring the sexist trappings for a moment, because I can't imagine many games where this actually ends in getting the princess home, why not assign them names and a location?  Since these explicitly only act as examples---typical stories of Aumyr, the book calls them---anyway, it seems like a perfect occasion to reinforce the world-building by setting it in Zeitan (to pick one region) with some newly made-up minor leader and his daughter.  In fairness, some do gesture at some specifics, but this feels like the part of the book that shows how much fun you could have by playing specifically in this world.

Similarly, while the "campaign ideas" have more specifics, they don't feel much more substantial than the one-shot adventures.  Again picking on the first entry, the idea of a hidden island where the population can bend reality absolutely sounds interesting, but I don't see how that story lasts any longer than chasing down the adventuring princess.

## Opportunities

If you visit [Aumyr's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting), you'll find what looks like the entire book in HTML sections, where you can file issues and suggest changes like any other repository.  They also offer an open invitation to join the [Aumyr Discord server](https://discord.gg/HP9bA4Z).

You can also check them out on a number of platforms, including the [Aumyr-it DeviantArt Gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/aumyr-it), though I note that none of the images carries an explicit public license.

## What's Adaptable?

I outlined the major components above, so I won't do so again, but I will point out that the folklore and adventure ideas feel like the most directly adaptable, in that you'd have little to translate about the Dragon Sepulchre legend or the Arcane Entity adventure seed into an unrelated world.

## Coming Attractions

Staying in the vague tradition of gaming, coming up next week, we'll play **Ancient Beast**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about Aumyr overall?
