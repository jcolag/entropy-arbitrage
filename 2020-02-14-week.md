[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1228318727764160512) [Something in Deep Space Is Sending Signals to Earth in Steady 16-Day Cycles](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxexwz/something-in-deep-space-is-sending-signals-to-earth-in-steady-16-day-cycles) from VICE

 > ...half a billion light years from Earth. That may seem like a huge distance, but FRB 180916.J0158+65 is actually the closest FRB ever detected.

Side note that would never fit into a tweet:  16.3 days sounded vaguely familiar to me when I read this story, so I crunched the numbers and realized that the square root of two times one million seconds is a bit more than 16.368 days.  That would be an impressive finding, if there was...y'know, **any** reason to believe that the universe (or aliens, sure) would think that seconds were an important unit to measuring time.  But "9,192,631,770 periods of radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of caesium-133 in a ground state at a temperature of absolute zero and at rest" [<sup class="fab fa-wikipedia-w"></sup>](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/second) doesn't seem like a likely universal experience.
