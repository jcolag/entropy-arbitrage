## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Cost of Living

This episode feels like it has its priorities confused, spending far too much time with the go-nowhere infestation plot and a side-trip through an artist commune that feels more like a bad drug trip, so expect me to skip a lot.  However, I should say up-front that episodes like this irritate me, in that they show how they *could* treat their recurring characters, and how those recurring characters might actually have more value to the show than the main cast, even though we spent the last two episodes on poker games and trying to obstruct justice.

 > **WORF**: Before he was allowed to play, he was to place his soiled clothing in the garment reprocessor.

As I asked about the O'Brien Sock War from [*In Theory*]({% post_url 2024-04-25-in-theory %}), what happened to the ship cleaning itself from [*Up the Long Ladder*]({% post_url 2023-03-23-up-long-ladder %})?  But they do have something comparable to laundry machines.

 > **TROI**: Please! Why not simply draw up a contract which clearly defines the duties of each family member.

This feels like such an inane plan, so utterly prone to failure, that I genuinely wish that we had a cut of this scene where Alexander called in his high-powered legal team[^1] for the negotiations.

[^1]:  I spent far too long researching a consensus on history's best lawyers, as if I would pitch a holodeck scene with the (typical for the franchise) joke of two historical figures, one random alien, and a contemporary famous person in the field.  But then I got side-tracked reading about [Johnnie Cochran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Cochran)'s career, and then realized that [Marvin Belli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Belli) still had a few years left to live at the time, who I imagine we all remember as [*And the Children Shall Lead*]({% post_url 2021-03-11-children %})'s Gorgon the Friendly Angel, and ended up reading about *his* career.  Anyway, that deep in reading about lawyers, I realized that the offhand comment would need all this setup and have no real point to it, since we can't exactly re-film the scene, so...here, have a lengthy footnote about it, I guess, encouraging everybody to read about Cochran and Belli.

And let's not forget the adverb, there, a condescending "simply" as if nobody could avoid that conclusion, and it takes no effort to negotiate a contract.

 > **TROI**: One day you'll learn to be glad your father cared enough about you to insist on rules. It may be hard to imagine right now, but eventually, most children come to appreciate their parents.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Riker to Counselor Troi. Your mother's just come aboard.
 >
 > **TROI**: On the other hand...

Do you get the joke?  Do you?  Come on, do you?

But seriously...?

 > **LWAXANA**: My poor, plodding, little Deanna, with her questions, questions, questions. Wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes? What matters, my little one, is that your mother's happy.

Given how much abuse this show heaps on Mrs. Troi, I have to admit to enjoying her poking at her useless daughter, which she'll do a few more times in the episode.

 > **LWAXANA**: Contracts are usually between people who don't really trust one another. A child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LWAXANA**: And if you fail to perform your duties, what is the child supposed to do about it?

*Thank* you.  This gets right to the heart of the contract problem, that neither side really understands how to build trust and only one side has any enforcement power.  Real contracts work---to the extent that they do, I mean---because it allows the party with less power to get the government to intervene on their behalf, if they have a good case.

In our world---perhaps ironically, given that we have Klingons in the discussion, here---lack of faith in the judicial leads to cultures that revolve around personal honor, historically resulting in people resolving conflicts with [duels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel).  The shoddy reasoning goes that, if you risk your life to protect your reputation, then you probably wouldn't do anything wrong, not noticing (or maybe not *caring*) that good reputations have far more value to people harming others than people doing good deeds.

In the modern world, you don't get that, but you often see [arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration), where the participants appeal to a third party who acts similar to a judge.  And in such cases, you need to worry about bias, because one party drives more business to the arbitrator, and so the arbitrator will want to keep that party happy.  Or, in this episode's case, the third party needs to work with Worf every day, and so probably won't impose anything but symbolic punishments on the more-powerful party.

 > **PICARD**: I will not continue have that woman continuing to use this ship for her convenience, simply because her daughter happens to be one of my officers.

Note that his anger only seems to focus itself on the one passenger, not the general policy of a military or similar force providing bus service.

 > **PICARD**: Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One. Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi.

*But do you get it, though?*

This show exhausts me...

 > **COMPUTER**: That program is available.
 >
 > **LWAXANA**: Oh, good. Then run it for us, dear.

If they could've brought Number One and Nurse Chapel into the story, we could've had Majel Barrett take over the show talking to herself...

 > **LWAXANA**: Campio is from a different planet with different traditions. He would not approve of a traditional Betazoid wedding, so I am happily adapting. Now it's as simple as that. I need some tea.
 >
 > **TROI**: I can't believe I'm hearing this from the Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx.

I hate that I need to say this, but...I agree with Little One, there.  Did they all abandon the idea of people respecting each other's and taking pride in their own cultures?

 > **ALEXANDER**: Are you very old?

You know, after all the abuse that they pile onto Lwaxana for the crime of aging, it seems like an interesting choice for a kid---where kids generally see everybody as old---doesn't see her as particularly old.

 > **RIKER**: Let's run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what this stuff is.

It worries me that either they didn't bother to do this a bunch of scenes ago, when they discovered the orange goop, or Riker doesn't believe that his people know their jobs.

 > **CAMPIO**: Indeed, Mrs. Troi. You are even lovelier in person.

You might recognize Campio as [Tony Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jay), who made a significant career of his deep voice.

 > **DATA**: This residue would be the waste left behind.

A better show would have had La Forge start angrily wiping his hands on Data's uniform screaming about touching space-poop...

 > **PICARD**: Well done. Mister Worf, coordinate your teams with Doctor Crusher and Commander La Forge. Assess damage and injury.

Apparently, you can sweat through those uniforms without much trouble.  So much for the future...

 > **RIKER**: You'd think she'd at least get to her own wedding on time.

...Why does everybody look at Lwaxana as if they've never seen a naked woman before?  Surely, somewhere in the galaxy, nudists have settled planets and made it a cultural mandate, for example.

## Conclusions

We don't get much out of this, other than a sense that we could've had a much better series about Lwaxana Troi going on adventures with Alexander.  Oh, and the episode also introduced us to the orange space-poop...

### The Bad

Troi at least makes it sound as if families frequently draft faux-contracts to push children into obeying their parents.

We also see a fair amount of bigotry, from Troi's treatment of the Klingons to the overall treatment of Lwaxana Troi even as the episode shows her as the smart one who cares about people.  While not necessarily the Federation, we even get some indication that forcing people to assimilate into local cultures happens routinely.

They continue to show an authoritarian lean to operations, with workers either waiting for permission to investigate problems or managers not trusting the workers to figure out the bare minimum of next steps.

### The Weird

Clothing does nothing to promote the evaporation of sweat, instead allowing it to pool on the body.  And apparently, seeing a woman without clothes shocks and scandalizes everyone.

## Next

In a week, come back for another remake of an original episode, but with different weird racial overtones, in *The Perfect Mate*.
