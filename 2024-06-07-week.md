As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

You want to always remember---as described to me by friends and colleagues of mine of Asian descent over the years---that immigration presents a massive filter to people.  You need, first, to have the motivation and resources (or a family with them) to relocate to another country.  Then, especially coming from Asia, you often need to prove that you can benefit the host country.  Because their children get raised by over-achievers with something to prove, they tend to also excel.

This applies to Asian-Americans, but also applies to the families of immigrants from almost anywhere.  And it also doesn't apply universally, nor does it sustain itself across many generations, so even Asian-Americans from relatively privileged backgrounds often receive criticism for not fitting a stereotype.  And when we also use that stereotype to ignore groups that don't get the same kind of exploitative pseudo-respect, we can see the danger in the stereotype.

While I find it fascinating on principle that we can now chart the interactions between cultures with some degree of fidelity, it mostly reminds me of how, when I went to school, educators seemed to have an obsession with talking about "cultural diffusion" without *quite* understanding what the phrase meant.  For example, local media would often run bare-bones educational material, often literally a teacher in an empty room with an opaque projector to broadcast their supplemental materials and sketches.  I remember stumbling on one "global studies" session (what New York State called early high school social studies classes at the time), where the teacher diligently gestured at a photograph of a market near a bridge, talking about how you could see the culture diffusing...

The field has come a long way, in other words.

 > Since I wrote something [wrapping up **Picard**](https://cohost.org/jcolag/post/1381365-a-whole-mess-of-pica) when it ended, it felt reasonable to do something similar for **Star Trek:  Discovery**, a show that I actually mostly enjoyed.  Unlike the rest of this "third generation" of the franchise, **Discovery** always seemed to want to break the mold and actually explore new (conceptual) space, even if it didn't always get there.  Or as I describe it in my snarkier moments, the only show (OK, along with **Prodigy**) in the modern franchise not trying to constantly convince me that I'd feel better watching **TNG** instead.

The post continues for about two thousand words, so I won't subject readers to the whole thing here.  I did post it to [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag/discovery-end), if you don't want to read it on Cohost.

I can't help note the extraordinary luck that Google had to have everyone talking about their janky Reddit-trained AI at a time when they chose to shutter the team responsible for helping stop dangerous criminals while preventing law enforcement from stomping through everyone's private data...

One of my favorite weird old novels has a protagonist who discovers a radioactive energy source and embarks on a global assassination campaign against anti-science cranks and religious dominionists, most prominently American judge and presidential candidate Greenleaf P. Stubbs.  I point this out **not** to call for Alito's death, by any means, but to say that if you had described him to me a few years ago, I would've insisted that you had created a tribute to Eden Phillpotts, because he defies all sense.

Clarence Thomas, I can at least understand (if not respect) as a separatist at heart, but Alito consistently acts like a sad Bond villain with *no* nuance...

Good.  As I've mentioned, I didn't have the opportunity to use the government's system this year, but this expansion puts the country on a path to a far better tax system.  More people going directly to the source means fewer people going to TurboTax or H&R Block, which means that they can't spend as much money lobbying Congress to make the tax system more onerous.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Chevron arrived in Alitay√©n, the ancestral territory of Brito's family, with promises of employment and compensation for the exploitation work. Both of these promises were accomplished, but the benefits of the project remained in the hands of the leaders of one of the community's clans.

I'd honestly rather have an article about the story behind the documentary, but I'll take what I can get, here...

 > As detailed in the AAUP white paper, only a handful of people testified in favor of SB 17, and almost all had stated or unstated affiliations with right-wing think tanks. In contrast, more than a hundred educators and citizens testified, or registered to testify, against the bill.

I wish that we had a solution to this sort of policy-laundering.  I mean, you would think that having so many organizations say "ignore everything that we've learned in the past thousand years and the opinions of the overwhelming majority of Americans, and follow our argument" would get them laughed out of every institution including courts, but apparently the veneer of intellectualism works and continues to pose a danger.

Given the utter lack of actual utility for AI, one might *almost* consider the possibility that somebody might have enough of a vested interest in (for example) fossil fuels to want to push renewable energy out of the news with something that happens to waste a lot of energy in failing to serve its purpose...
