In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Bloodlines

Since our last post, the fallout from [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}) continued over on **Deep Space Nine** with Federation citizens functionally exiled to Cardassian territory, as they wrap up *The Maquis*, part II.

And as if desperate to keep pace as the series slides through its final arc, this episode somehow decides that we needed to follow up on [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}) again.

 > **RIKER**: There's an object of some kind closing in on our position.

And all this time, I've treated him like somebody who doesn't have much analytical ability.  But he has managed to narrow the situation down to *an object*, almost certainly not a verb or a description...

He has a couple of lines like this in the episode, too.

 > **BOK**: I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you or how you murdered my son. For fifteen years now I've thought about how to avenge his death but nothing I could do to you could equal what you did to me, until now. You thought you could hide him from me, didn't you? But I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead. I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine.

Bok last appeared in and references [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}), though this time [Lee Arenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Arenberg) plays him, who we saw as a different Ferengi in [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}).

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine if it's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. Mister Data, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul about fifty years ago.

Wait, did Picard actually have a relationship with a woman his own age?  Patrick Stewart had his fifty-forth birthday coming up in a couple of months when this aired.

I should probably mention that I don't strongly object to age gaps in relationships in principle.  But they do introduce a potential imbalance that can become a power-based dynamic, and we have seen that Picard and Riker have a tendency to pursue people with less power, so I can't imagine that he takes any steps to avoid such an evolution.

 > **PICARD**: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.

Do they...not have anything better to do?

Don't get me wrong.  Saving a life seems fairly important.  But if a captain of a naval battleship got a message like this, does he get to turn the ship around to go meet his estranged son?

 > **PICARD**: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty-four years ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never managed to get together again.

This borders on nitpicking the writing, but it also seems entirely in-character for Picard to deliver a boring monologue mostly telling us things that we already figured out from context plus a few details that nobody cares about.

 > **PICARD**: No, so either Bok is wrong, and I'm not the father, or Miranda decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise me. She was very independent, very strong-willed.

Also, he doesn't exactly present himself as a likely candidate for parenthood, between the whining about the presence of children, the running around lifting important artifacts from archaeological sites, and propensity for violence.

 > **JASON**: I realize I wasn't supposed to be spelunking that cave, but don't you have something better to do?

See?  Even he thinks so...

 > **JASON**: She died a few years ago.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test?

Notice Picard's profound grief at an old flame's death.  Too bad, already on to plan B for checking paternity.

 > **JASON**: No, I just enjoy climbing.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Without an antigrav harness?

Think about all the times that these people have mourned the loss of the "good old days" when people didn't have all this ugly technology mediating their world (and keeping them alive), but he meets *one* spelunker and demands to know why he doesn't levitate his way through his hobby.

 > **PICARD**: So, what do you do?
 >
 > **JASON**: I'm between jobs right now.

I notice that the first-season pretense of people only taking jobs to improve themselves has fallen by the wayside, and people need to justify their existence through productivity.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collected over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And this, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare.

Pillage.

 > **JASON**: Is it valuable?

Remember, nobody in the Federation cares about economic value...except for the people who do.

 > **PICARD**: But that cluster consists of more than twenty star-systems.

Oh, so sorry that they can *only* narrow down his search from the entire galaxy---at least a hundred billion stars to twenty solar systems.  Did he expect a foreign government that he constantly insults and antagonizes to find him a street address?

 > **PICARD**: Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. My sense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to.

That might have sounded like a more reasoned plan before he took his son into protective custody...

 > **TROI**: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship's Counselor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think I should go.

I can't think of a single time that she has reached out to try to help a guest aboard the ship or tried to maintain any semblance of professionalism, so I have to assume that she actually showed up to spy for her boss.

 > **PICARD**: Security to Captain's quarters immediately.

Rather than jacking up the tension, this cliffhanger feels silly, as if somebody would actually deliver that threat in person.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twice for disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing.

They introduce this in some attempt to show the kid as some potentially dangerous rogue, but this feels like a pretty sad rap sheet.  And how poor a job of sneaking around do you need to do that you get arrested for trespassing *dozens* of times and not get busted for anything more significant?

Also, they really should have tied this to Picard's collection of archaeological knick-knacks.  He wanders through ancient heritage sites and walks off with whatever he likes, and gets to deliver speeches as the bestest amateur in the business...

 > **RHODES**: Lieutenant Rhodes.

You might recognize Rhodes as [Amy Pietz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Pietz), who among other roles would begin starring in [**Caroline in the City**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_in_the_City), itself led by (increasingly relevant to *Star Trek*) Lea Thompson, with an appearance in **Picard** a couple of years back.

 > **PICARD**: I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has a starship, he has technology.

Gasp, he has *technology*?  Does he have fire and the wheel?

 > **PICARD**: It was self-defense. He fired on my ship.

What we learned in *The Battle* strongly suggested that he didn't, so either Picard learned nothing from that incident or has decided to safely stick to his official story and deny any wrongdoing or error on his part.

 > **PICARD**: What do you mean degenerative?

What about that word does he not understand?

 > **PICARD**: Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've found out that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it's only petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I had been part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now.

Right, because children from privileged families *never* get into trouble. {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **DATA**: The Federation abandoned its research in the field because the technology was found to be unreliable, as well as energy intensive.

I should note that using "energy intensive" as a reason to abandon a technology means that the Federation doesn't have anything like unlimited energy, even from its constant matter-antimatter reactions.

 > **PICARD**: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any way we can protect him?

It seems rather telling that Picard hasn't pieced together the clearer, more explicit threat, here, and he still thinks that this should end with some sort of duel.  Does he not remember the previous scene where Crusher told him that Jason might not respond to treatment for his neurological degeneration?

I mean, his assumption improbably pans out for him, but unless Picard has read the script, at this point, he *should* assume that Bok intends for Jason to die in a powerless Picard's arms, not---as we actually see later---at the point of a knife where Picard gets to bust in like a movie cop to save the day.

 > **PICARD**: I like climbing. There's something about actually having your fate in your own hands.

See?  But use your magic levitation device or the magic transforming rumpus room, so that you don't *actually* have your life in your own hands.

 > **PICARD**: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend the vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I don't want the same thing to happen to you and me.

How does it not completely mortify Picard to tell this kid, who has explained that he grew up with almost nothing, that the central conflict in his life happened over whether he would operate the family's vineyards?  And he wants to compare this to Jason not finding him nearly interesting enough to want in his life at the moment.

 > **PICARD**: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline again in the same way.

I wonder how much of Picard's obsession with having power over people---his crew, random foreigners, and so forth---has to do with his insecurity over his hair.

And, by the way, once we find out that Bok faked Picard's paternity, we'll never hear from Jason again, even in the TV series about Picard sublimating his need for family by going on ill-advised adventures.

## Conclusions

We don't really get much out of this mess, but as always, we'll try...

### The Good

We see some acknowledgement that Picard would make a miserable parent.

### The Bad

Starfleet apparently doesn't mind captains taking their ships on personal missions, and their big speed limit may not apply to such emergencies.

Once again, we see a disinterest in expressing grief.

We see a certain (new?) hypocrisy arise.  On one hand, they believe in risking their lives in testing their abilities against external forces.  But on the other, they think that everybody should use the fanciest safety equipment that removes any chance of danger.

In addition, we see the rampant inequality in the Federation, with some people haunted by not taking over the family business and others dying in a petty theft gone wrong.  They also consider petty theft, disorderly conduct, and trespassing as serious crimes to worry about.  Certain kinds of people need to justify their time with their jobs.  And they believe that people from privileged backgrounds would never commit crime...despite the extensive showcasing of archaeology.

Picard, at least, fully expects foreign governments to roll over and do all his legwork for him.  And he doesn't think that he owes anybody any gratitude for narrowing down his search by a factor of ten billion.

The crew shows a surprising-even-for-them disinterest in understanding things.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the crew once again works to avoid dealing with the computer routinely creating consciousness, in *Emergence*.
