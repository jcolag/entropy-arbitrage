In my recent post about [revising my *Silver Bat* novel]({% post_url 2025-09-14-revisit-silver-bat %}), I promised that I'd provide the first chapter---in effect, a standalone short story---as a teaser for the full book "soon."  The day has now come.

![A dark figure running down a dark, metallic-looking alley](/blog/assets/refuge-cover-blank.png "And clang, again, for good measure")

Yes, I still have plans to continue my series of posts [defining Free Culture]({% post_url 2025-09-21-define-free-culture-1 %}), probably next week, unless some major event demands that I put together a post for that, instead.

Buckle in.  You'll find explanations at the end, as usual.

## Just Another Night in the Life

Clang, clang, clang.  Bang, rat-a-tat.  Clang, clang, clang, clang.  Rat-a-tat.  This is getting repetitive.

Weeks of planning, and some nights, it still all comes down to nothing more than running across the city's catwalks dodging gunfire.  Typical.  What's the saying?  No plan survives---

"*No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength*, madame, as stated by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder," he corrects me over the radio.  I didn't think I said any of that out loud.  Also typical, unfortunately.

The plan started out well enough.  Truth be told, it probably isn't going all that badly now, either, except for the bullets.  Speaking of which...

"Jeeves, the apartments ahead are definitely abandoned," I ask.  I'm really not in the mood to stomp on these creeps with an audience available for them to potentially hold hostage.

"Indeed, it would appear that nobody has signed a lease for any of those squalid rooms in the three minutes since you most recently inquired, madame."

Jackass.

"You may also wish to know that Miss Jumaima has begun disabling the security cameras in your projected path as you reach them.  If she cannot access them in a timely fashion, however, she sends her regrets in advance and suggests covering the lens."

Getting caught on camera is the last thing we need, so I hope that she can hurry up.

Oops!  A bullet nearly hit.  I probably shouldn't divide my focus with snide remarks about people helping out, especially when I certainly can't do what she does.  I don't need to fall hundreds of feet to my death, either.

Where was I?  Right, the easy job.  My local informants started hearing rumors about a sweatshop in Little Graustark a couple of weeks ago, tied up with Ouida Hepler's fast fashion line.  A cabbie who we protected a few months back came forward to confirm the conditions.  Best our accountants can trace through the ledgers, the operation is probably technically run by the Central Anarchist Council, hiring immigrants primarily from Javasu, and keeping their passports in a safe to prevent their complaining about conditions or escaping, a disgusting but all too common practice around the world.

Distracting the guards went smoothly enough, a slightly sharp odor setting them on edge before coaxing a backfire out of a passing car.  Everyone was quite accommodating about that part.  With the guards out of the way, it's not hard to crack a safe when you're working over a fly-by-night operation like this, either, so we have their passports.  Asmait was even right on time with the bus, so I only needed to clear the guards as they began to turn back.

Well, short version, all the workers are on a bus to a Wooster facility, where my people will get them good jobs and, for those that fear retribution from the Council or from back home, new identities.  All in all, not a bad night's work.

Except that I didn't account for the sweatshop or the Council hiring Xavier Exley.  The man has five best-actor awards and a decade of box office smashes under his belt, but one little encounter with a strange meteorite (or so he claims) that turns his hand into a necrotic mess draining the life of anything he touches, and suddenly he thinks that moonlighting as a criminal henchman seems like a legitimate career move.  "The Black Fist," he calls himself, as if anybody could take that seriously.  He even has all kinds of "X marks the spot" motifs and puns that he could be using, but he has a blackened hand, and he punches people with it, so of course he goes with the Black Fist.

I could suggest that he's too old to spend his time like this, running around the city with his shirt unbuttoned trying to murder people, but then I might have to think about how close we are in age and the fact that I'm running on the same catwalks as him.  At least I don't have my blouse unbuttoned, which I could totally do if I didn't wear a turtleneck for these missions.

Either way, let me tell you, his touch _is_ cold enough to burn, and takes the wind out of you, so that much about him is serious, at least.  "Would not recommend to a friend," as my kid would say.

However, I also can't have that kind of danger following the bus, hence the merry chase through the rarefied air of the city's upper catwalks.  Every time I make my way up here, it reminds of how claustrophobic it all feels.  It's strange, too.  Every move feels like it might lead into a trap, as if the next step in any direction is going to smack right into a wall.  And yet, the upper catwalks are also one of the few places in the city where most people can get a clear view of the night sky, and that's not even to mention the hundreds of feet potentially dropping back down to ground level, if anything goes wrong.  Leave it to the Seven Cities, of which there are really only two of significance, to make a person feel isolated and trapped, suspended in as close to open air as the cities get.  It's a place of contradictions.

"Madame, you should know that, according to all current scans, we have still seen no new occupants in the housing ahead.  Repeat, I have continued to detect no new occupants in the preceding two minutes."

I'm not sure if it bothers me more that he needed to twist the knife or that he knew that I was genuinely about to ask again.

Regardless, we've reached the apartments, jutting out past the buildings they sit atop, to shadow the street even more than the other buildings.  Most importantly, it's empty, yes I remembered, meaning those bullets that I manage to dodge won't threaten anybody but me.  And that means...

"Now!"

A flare passes right behind me, from down on the street.  The guards hesitate, which is all I need to switch catwalks and get behind them on the high ground.  In the distance, I vaguely hear the staccato of our shop-owner confederate barking to give the impression that the flare was part of his late-night sales promotion.

The distraction works.  A strike to the back of their knees and the rear two go down, never even noticing me.

The man in the middle loses his balance.  He tips over the railing.  I'll get back to him after the others.

The leaders pivot.  A swift punch, and Lefty's gun clatters to the catwalk below.  Righty lets off another rat-a-tat that goes high.  It leaves him open.

I dive, pushing the gun in Lefty's way, using his momentum to keep Righty in position.  Grabbing Righty's leg, I flip him into the apartment.  I hear the gun hit the back wall.

Lefty pulls a knife.  Middle has almost gotten back up.  Pulling Middle over my shoulder, I let Lefty take out his own partner, and down he goes.

It takes a little bit more work to get these creeps secure in the apartment.  Jeeves has a tip into the cops soon after.  The muscle obviously won't give up the Council, might not even know that the Council exists, but the guns will get them arrested, and Ouida Hepler's people will provide evidence incriminating them to keep the Hepler name out of it.  They're sleazy, but predictable enough to plan around.

And that just leaves...

"Face me!"

...Exley.  Did he hang back a few minutes just to make a dramatic entrance?  Hardly worth the trouble in high-end jeans and a flannel shirt.  Every time I need to deal with him, I'm surprised by how much shorter he is in person.

"So," he intones as if he's trying to impress some invisible director, "it is down to you, and it is down to me, foul fiend who was once my ally."  Wait, he's shouting dialogue from the _Revenge of the Serpent Emperor_ series.  I knew he wasn't creative, but this feels like a completely different level of tripe.  He didn't even get that role.

He jabs, coming too close.

"Madame, you will recall that he drains energy proportional to the momentum of his hand," comes over the earpiece.  Yes, yes, dodge the fist, as if that wasn't already my top priority.

Jab, jab.  He's more aggressive with the normal hand, possibly so I'll focus on those punches for a while.

One, two.  One, two.  He learned to box, somewhere along the way.

Sirens.  The cops are almost here.

One, two.  One, two.  One, two, a slight step for a haymaker.  His fist flies out.  I use the opportunity to slip inside his reach and slap handcuffs on his wrist.  Then, over he goes, where I cuff the other end to the railing.  The cops will want to chat with Mister ExEx, here, about some extortion cases, so he won't need to dangle here for too long, assuming they're not on the take.  If they are, eventually somebody will probably take pity on an over-the-hill movie star.

I can hear Cibola's finest breaking down the apartment door.  Unfortunately, they would also want to have a chat with the mystery woman leaving a trail of beaten-up lackeys.  The empty apartments weren't the only reason I took the fight up here, however.

A quick vault to the window's lintel and sprint over the rooftop, and bingo!  A rat's nest of decades of power and network cables most of the way down.  It's not the safest way to travel, especially if they have any breakages in the insulation, but it's probably a lot safer than exposing the operation by openly jogging away from a crime scene.

No breakages in the cables.  Good.  I didn't feel like an electrocution, this time of night, or even of drawing attention to myself by knocking out somebody's network.  It takes over a minute to slide down to ground level, and I need to drop the last dozen feet or so down.  Ditch the sunglasses and beret, roll the turtleneck off my face, pull my necklace outside the shirt, and buy a cheap counterfeit blazer at one of the ground-level kiosks hawking bootleg wares at night, and just like that, the Silver Bat vanishes into the night.

A bullet grazed my leg, though.  I should probably take care of that.  And almost on cue, here's one of the kid's mobile clinics that he thinks we don't know about.  The boy will go far, but needs to cover his tracks better.  We can help him do that.  Should.  We *will* help him do that, soon.

In fact, "Jeeves, put an appointment on my boy's calendar, tomorrow afternoon.  Say nothing about his birthday.  And tell the in-laws that it's time we let him work his magic, no more excuses."  We used to need throat microphones to inconspicuously talk, but mobile phones changed that expectation, as long as we don't say anything openly incriminating or identify anybody by name.

"Indeed, madame, no excuses, no reference to Master Egbert's birthday."

"Excellent.  And see if Albert wants to go dancing after my leg stops throbbing.  We should celebrate.  Oh, and the party?"

"Scheduled with full attendance.  Miss Yelena has agreed to contrive an encounter that will guide him to the museum's rear hall."

A passing kid takes two bucks to get me a bandage and some antiseptic from the clinic.  I probably should've offered him ten, but figured he'd want to haggle.  Oh, well.  I'll figure out who he is later and pay the family's rent.  Or buy the entire block and lower the rent, like an adult.  People down here work to hard for not enough.

Tomorrow.  After the real family business changes hands.  And some dancing.  It has been a good night, with a new dawn just on the horizon...

## Chapter Credits

The full book mixes these citations in with those from across the rest of the book, organized by type and source, so I hope that you'll pardon the terseness created by my trying to surgically pull out only the relevant parts.

### Persons

The main characters loosely derive from the [*Jeeves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeeves#Jeeves_canon) stories.

Xavier Exley, a.k.a. the [Black Fist](https://web.archive.org/web/20120819062728/http://www.30characters.com/2010/11/02/3-the-black-fist/), created by Vito Delsante[^zq_3Iv], who [released the character](https://web.archive.org/web/20110205045337/http://www.vitodelsante.com/?p=495) (along with more than thirty others) under the terms of the Creative Commons Share-Alike 3.0 license.

[^zq_3Iv]:  Yes, an actual [professional comic book writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Delsante), with popular runs at both DC and Marvel under their belt, has dipped their toes into the world of Free Culture.  Delsante actually did another batch later, but you can try to dig out the announcements on your own time...

The never-encountered character of David Hepler comes from a [Wikipedia hoax](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews:Bad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense#Dave_Hepler) about a fictional President of the United States, presumably available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 license, though *possibly* under the old Wikinews Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license, since Wikinews has hosted it since the article's deletion.  You can probably imagine why I found the idea of a fast food-devouring, belligerent, imperialistic, brand-obsessed American President useful for the context.  I added Ouida, whose relationship I deliberately never define, due to one of the defining creepy parts of the 2019 White House.

### Places

Javasu comes from Mary Willcocks Baker's [Princess Caraboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Caraboo) hoax in the early nineteenth century.

I loosely adapted the legend of the [Seven Cities of Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Cities_of_Gold) for the larger metropolitan area used as the primary setting.

### Things

The Central Anarchist Council comes from **The Man Who Was Thursday** (1908) by G.K. Chesterton, in the public domain due to a long-expired copyright.

The [**Revenge of the Serpent Emperor**](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Revenge_of_the_Serpent_Emperor:_Showdown_at_Area_51,_Part_II_-_Dawn_of_the_Blood_Sun.html) films come from Fictopedia, made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

## The Story from Here

As I mentioned at the top, this "teaser" chapter tells its own self-contained story to set the tone without bogging the main plot down in exposition, while also---in those final paragraphs---setting the direction for the next chapter.  Picking up where this chapter leaves off, the back cover of the new edition uses this as the book blurb.

> E.B., black sheep heir to the Wooster fortune, wakes up on his birthday to find that his family not only approves of his underground aid efforts, but has secretly spent a century rescuing people in danger, and the time has come to pass the torch to him. Breaking out political prisoners takes much less of a toll than realizing that he grew up to become his parents...

Along the way, we encounter a bunch of characters with roots from around the world, pass through at least two fictional states in the United States, and more.

## A Word from Our Sponsor

As a quick warning, the big sponsor looks suspiciously like me wearing a top hat...

Most of you probably already know this, but if you enjoyed the story and would like to read another fifty-something thousand words in the same vein, I invite you buy the book.  And you can support me while you do it.

- On [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/aFa4gzaPY9tx9KG17ubAs02), if you give me three bucks, I'll e-mail you the PDF and ePUB versions in a ZIP archive as soon as I can.
- On [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), *it* will handle delivery if you give it the three bucks, *or* you can join the membership program for less per month and download it free.
- If you can't remember those, this website now has an official [digital store](https://john.colagioia.net/store/).

If you'd like the rest of the book and *don't* find it worth three bucks---no shame, there, we all have times when that seems like too much to spend---and you don't mind sloppier text and some terrible ideas that I have since fixed, I invite you to check out the first edition in the following spots.

- Check [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/seekingrefuge), for the full book in a variety of formats.
- Head for [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/silver-bat-01-seeking-refuge), if you want the first edition's Markdown source.
- Try [GitHub](https://github.com/jcolag/silver-bat-01-seeking-refuge), if you want the first edition's Markdown source and still spend your time on GitHub.

Or, you can wait until March 2026, when I plan to release this version free and update the repositories.

And...well, you all know me.  If you *really* want to check out the current version of the book and can't afford the price or the wait, get in touch.  We can probably work something out.  I'd much rather know that people enjoyed the book than argue over three bucks.

Either way, if I see a decent response to the book, other books will start showing up more rapidly than if I only find myself doing this for my personal edification...
