## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Second Chances

Remembering to check the broader franchise, over on **DS9**, Lwaxana Troi shows up, developing a crush on Odo so that he can act uncomfortable.  Meanwhile, this episode serves as more of a character piece, for a fairly uninteresting character, so I don't feel optimistic, here.  Mo' Riker(s), mo' problems, I guess...

 > Captain's log, stardate 46915.2. The Enterprise is orbiting Nervala Four, waiting for an opportunity to retrieve scientific data left there by Starfleet researchers when they were forced to evacuate eight years ago.

Maybe more importantly for us, we get an eyeful of civilian clothing.

 > **TROI**: Will's been trying to get this piece right for ten years now. He's never made it through the solo. Here it comes.

It seems like she did that to publicly embarrass her friend and colleague.

 > **DATA**: The transporters are considerably more efficient than those used on the *Potemkin* eight years ago.

The *Potemkin* has gotten a few mentions in the franchise, most recently in [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), and it presumably takes its name from the [Russian battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Potemkin), made famous to Western audiences in the famous [silent film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_Potemkin) dramatizing the 1905 mutiny now considered an early step in or precursor to the 1917 Russian Revolution.

However, I might suggest that maybe *Star Trek* uses the reference to the [Potemkin Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village) scheme, and more broadly about people feeling replaced.  I say this, because they've dropped the name in [*The Ultimate Computer*]({% post_url 2021-01-21-ultimate %}) where they tried to empty out ships of the crew to replace them with AI, [*Turnabout Intruder*]({% post_url 2021-07-29-turnabout %}) where Janice Lester tried to replace Captain Kirk, [*Legacy*]({% post_url 2023-12-14-legacy %}) where we met Tasha Yar's sister...and two others that don't really support my theory, then this one giving us a duplicate Riker.

 > **RIKER 2**: That's not possible. I'm Will Riker.

Ugh.  Do you have to spray for Riker infestations, or can you leave out a few traps?

 > **PALMER**: Phase distortion is dropping. The second transport window opens in forty-two seconds.

If you don't recognize Palmer, go fix that now, because real-life first African-American woman in space---and medical doctor, too, and an occasional choreographer, because why not?---[Mae Jemison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Jemison) plays her.

 > **WORF**: We are losing time. Lieutenant Riker should be here.

Heh.  Who would've thought that we'd ever see an unprepared Riker?  Oh, right, the one that we have *never* prepares.

 > **RIKER**: I didn't. He came on board the *Enterprise* to brief me when I was offered the *Aries*.

We saw this in [*The Icarus Factor*]({% post_url 2023-02-23-icarus-factor %}).

 > **TROI (reading)**: Meet me in Transporter room three at nineteen hundred hours. It's important.

Troi apparently can't read to herself.  I get that they do this for *our* benefit, to avoid contriving some way to let us read the note, but it still makes her look like she has trouble reading silently.

 > **RIKER 2**: I do. Things are a little more complicated than I had planned, but there's nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what I want.

His inability to show up on time, his poor people skills, the massive chip on his shoulder, the eight-year gap in his résumé, and probably a few other things *might* stand in the way, actually.

 > **RIKER**: I just met with the Captain about your mission recommendation. I would appreciate it if next time you came to me first.

Does he ever not whine?

 > **CRUSHER**: Then what happened?
 >
 > **TROI**: Beverly!

How does this read as offensive in any way?  They have a history, and neither has any commitment to anybody else.  Oh, right, potentially healthy relationships get kept secret.

 > **RIKER**: Full boat, kings over. I'd like to thank you both for your very generous contributions.

First, once again, they loaf around playing games when they have a strict deadline.

Second, "generous contributions" seems to mean that they play with actual currency, because he probably wouldn't say anything about worthless plastic chips.

 > **RIKER**: I've practiced in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing. Here's your hundred and twenty more.

He practices facial expressions in the mirror?  This episode tells us far more about this man than I ever wanted to know.  Maybe this stems from some deep insecurity, but given how he treats people, it almost sounds like Riker tries to manipulate people by practicing his reactions like Data does.

 > **RIKER 2**: Captain Picard made has some inquiries. He managed to get me a posting on the *Gandhi*. And considering how long I've been out of commission, it's an amazing opportunity.

I probably don't need to tell you about [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi), but in case I did, you now have that information.

 > **RIKER 2**: Deanna. After I've served for six months, I'm eligible to bring family aboard. If we got married---

While I suppose that it makes some sense to not uproot a family if you don't know if the assignment will work out, it still sounds suspiciously like the privilege of living with your family comes with acquired power, as opposed to need.

 > **DATA**: But Commander Riker and Lieutenant Riker are. Yet they seem to have trouble getting along with each another. I have found that humans value their uniqueness, that sense that they are different from every one else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Could that be the source of the friction?

But...doesn't Data *have* a double of himself?  I don't think that I hallucinated Lore, but given how many people remember this as a progressive, optimistic show, and I see something different, maybe I did.

 > **RIKER**: Next time, don't give up so easily.

Sigh...The writers make it so incredibly difficult to like or respect this creep.

## Conclusions

We don't even get to hear *Night Bird*, so we don't get much out of this mess beyond the clothing.

### The Bad

This episode highlights a lot of unprofessional behavior.  Everybody seems to support Troi's insistence on embarrassing a colleague in front of everybody.  Riker goes out of his way to make his new brother feel bad multiple times, while whining that people don't respect him enough and hinting that he thinks of himself as a manipulator.  They also (again) seem to play games on duty.

We again see that they see healthy relationships as mortifying secrets.

### The Weird

At least Troi seems unable to read without speaking the words aloud.

The crew appears to bet actual money when playing their games.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the *Enterprise* gets blown up a few more times, in *Timescape*.
