As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

None of this surprises me, and probably doesn't surprise you, but I appreciate having a firmer historical record on these issues.

For those of you unfamiliar with the creep, [Curtis Sliwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa) pioneered most of what this iteration of the Trump administration does.  Imagining criminals behind every lamp-post, he rounded up vigilante squads to "patrol" already over-policed spaces, staging attacks to "rescue" people from and faking an injury, not to mention all the extremely racist comments.  And he keeps running for public office, as if decades of that behavior makes him fit to run anything.

Unlike Trump, at least, the media doesn't take him at all seriously, which does bring a smile to my face.

 > Solar energy is not only one of the cleanest forms of electricity, it’s also cheaper than energy from fossil fuels in much of the world, including large parts of the United States. Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S.

The assorted regulations pushing back against solar power sit alongside the laws barring community-run Internet service as almost impressive how far in advance industry in the United States can plan when they find something to care about...

Remember, in the United States, the [Thirteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) says "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime** whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Goodreads has done this kind of thing before and its review guidelines state it will delete “unusual” reviews or “limit the ability to submit ratings.” The idea behind this is to prevent review bombing of controversial figures, but the author’s Goodreads protects tend to be conservatives. In the summer of 2024, it [<u style="box-sizing:border-box;text-decoration-color:rgb(145, 252, 78);text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;text-decoration-thickness:auto;">temporarily halted reviews</u>](https://archive.is/o/2hFpU/https://www.404media.co/j-d-vance-hillbilly-elegy-goodreads-reviews/) of JD Vance’s memoir _Hillbilly Elegy_ after people had begun to dunk on the Vice President by leaving reviews for the book. There are many “unusual” reviews still up for Harris’ memoir, including a one-star review that says “Did not read but so sick of seeing this 💩 in my suggested 🖕🖕”

Not specified in the post, except buried in a minor quote from the moderator in question, Amazon owns Goodreads.  And that frame makes this far less surprising, since they don't exactly mind [putting their thumbs](https://www.cjr.org/political_press/the-washington-post-opinion-editor-approved-a-harris-endorsement-a-week-later-the-papers-publisher-killed-it.php) on the scale of democracy.
