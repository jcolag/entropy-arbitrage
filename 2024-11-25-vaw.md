Today marks the (deep breath...) [International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Elimination_of_Violence_against_Women), which mainly focuses on domestic violence, and based on the name I shouldn't need to answer more questions than that, though the history of the day fascinates me.  And given the current political situation in the United States, we may need to start marking it more often.

And on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the second.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the fifth of November.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For November, I wrote a piece on dumping yet another streaming service, revisited the people-search sites, discussed media consumption skewed slightly towards celebrating Native American Heritage Month, and provided some new background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage %}

What work on the blog, this week, went to making little fixes to the license specifiers that I still haven't decided whether I'll use.  The public domain mark {% cc pd %} no longer has the Creative Commons "bullet" attached, and the licenses now look more like they "sit right" on the line of text.

Links to Microsoft sites---because of last week's [post listing the blogs that I read]({% post_url 2024-11-17-blogs %}) called attention to the gap---now get the little logo annotation treatment that other links do.  Footnotes, because it became clear that the multiple footnotes in [*Star Trek* season round-ups]({% post_url 2024-11-14-ng-season-5 %}) have huge readability problems, now also get some padding and a footsteps {% emoji human footprints %} emoji[^1].

[^1]:  Like that one.  Apologies to anybody thinking that this note would have any sophisticated insight.

And nobody probably cares about it, but I updated the version of Jekyll used to v4.3.4.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Generic Board Game**](https://github.com/jcolag/generic-board-game), [**Miniboost**](https://github.com/jcolag/Miniboost), my [**Morning Dashboard**](https://github.com/jcolag/dash), [**Picture to Nonogram**](https://github.com/jcolag/picture-nonogram), the mostly useless [**Replybrary**](https://github.com/jcolag/library-twtterbot), and [**Zoea**](https://github.com/jcolag/zoea).

## Next

One more week without a plan, other than clearing out the remaining library updates.
