Today Koreans (often?) observe the birthday of [Deposed Queen Yun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposed_Queen_Yun), whose murder caused turmoil that included the first [literati purges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges).  And yes, I largely picked a historical birthday at random.

![Gyeongbokgung Palace at night, and built up over six hundred years](/blog/assets/Gyeongbokgung-Palace-Night-View.png "I honestly have no idea if I cropped out important parts of the facility or random nearby neighborhoods, but I decided to focus on the palace-like part instead of the traffic out front...")

And on we go to the projects.

## Catfish

No, I haven't spent the week posing as romantic partners to lonely people to relieve them of their savings[^3].  I have instead made a minor cooking discovery, during the week, about the actual fish.  A while back, I bought a bag of catfish "nuggets," some sort of euphemism for irregularly shaped pieces that didn't fit when they cut the fish into steaks, rather than consistently small pieces.

[^3]:  As if I'd use the blog to detail my personal life.  Although imagine the hilarity of a blog where some random person posts under their real name about crime that they commit.  And imagine the spam article pitches that such a blog would get...

Looking up recipes, everybody recommends the same thing:  Bread them and fry them.  People have slightly different opinions on the breading and on whether to deep-fly, pan-fry, or "air-fry[^2]," but I didn't see more variation than that.  For the first couple of meals, then, I simplified that to only dredging through flour and pan-fried the nuggets, and they came out fine, remarkably similar to...literally anything else that you'd bread and fry.

[^2]:  Don't get me started on how the appliance industry has somehow chosen to rebrand the venerable convection oven as a toy that doesn't do what it claims any more than the Shake & Bake brand made your conventional oven fry anything...

And that realization then led to the realization that I recognized this approach to recipes.  When *I* bread and fry something unfamiliar, I usually do so because I can't think of a better plan and don't mind spending time hovering over hot oil.  As with the rest of my hemisphere, though, I've had to deal with high temperatures and humidity, and so didn't want to mess around with breading food that attracts condensation, nor did I want to babysit a hot pan.

As an alternative, I took inspiration from people steaming fish, but keeping the frying pan.  I started by pan-roasting some vegetables and crushed leftover tortilla chips, and when they warmed through, laid out the catfish nuggets on top of that, and left them to cook for a few more minutes.  Then, I dumped everything in a bowl with---yes, I decided to go with a lazy sauce---black pepper, minced garlic, drained capers, a small pat of butter, and some lemon juice.

I don't have any pictures, because I didn't expect any interesting results and...honestly, it didn't look any more interesting than a pile of vegetables with white hunks of fish tossed in.  But it came out fairly well, took far less effort than breading and frying would have in this weather, and I'll definitely try variations on the idea going forward.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

Oh, this might get convoluted as I try to cover everything.  I guess that the convolution makes some sense.  While I've regularly made small changes to the blog over the years, I haven't made a concerted effort to improve the usability since [Christmas 2019]({% post_url 2019-12-25-upgrades %}), less than a month into writing here.

Can you deal with subheadings for these posts?  Maybe that'll make things easier to follow...

### Indie Web Adjacency

I spent some time overhauling my handling of those social-style posts, and...well, let's let *me* explain what we have, since I already technically did that in a slightly different place.

{% nest 2024-07-10-1 %}

You got that right, John-from-the-past.  The blog now has a parallel index and RSS feed for these little one-off kinds of posts, if and when the mood strikes me.

Maybe the most interesting *technological* thing that you would want to know for these purposes has to do with using the plugin, nesting a post inside some other page, inside a loop.  It turns out that Jekyll and Liquid apparently haven't directly considered calling a plugin with a variable as the parameter, such as `{``% nest {``{ post.file }``} %``}`---more or less, because I can't type it directly into a post without Jekyll trying to render it, meaning that you get some bogus spacing in there---so I needed to jump through an extra hoop or two to make that work.

You might recall, when [I wrote the original version of my `nest` plugin]({% post_url 2024-04-01-fool %}) in April, I mentioned needing to use the `render()` function's `context` parameter to find the post's content and layout.  Here, I needed to use it again, to get the value of the post's variable.

```ruby
post_id = _context[@post_id]
```

That lets the loop in the aforementioned index page pass in its `post` variable as the plugin's input, by looking up the value---the name of the target post---via the context.  It feels incredibly silly to support two almost-identical plugins, but it does the job without requiring me to go back through every post where I've used the original to mess around with the inputs.

Along the way, I updated some layouts, such as the general "social" post, set everything to handle Webmentions, and updated the stylesheet, but I don't think any of that would surprise anybody...

I have more, though...

### Tables of Contents

Expecting to need a plugin to make this next bit work, I discovered that Jekyll has a poorly documented (if at all) feature to automatically generate tables of contents in posts, grabbing the headings.  Each post needs what looks like a bogus unordered list---an asterisk followed by ignored text, where in my case, I use *Ignore for ToC* to make the point---with `{:toc}` on the next line.  I've wanted contents, especially for long posts, for a long time, and had no idea that Jekyll supported it natively.

Starting with Thursday's post on [*A Matter of Time*]({% post_url 2024-07-11-matter-time %}), every post (with headings, I mean) has included a table of contents.  If you haven't seen it, it expands out of the "hamburger menu" icon to the left of the page on desktop when you hover over it.  That brings me to another discovery of note:  The `hover` media query in CSS.

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  /* styles for whatever element types, IDs, and classes... */
}
```

If you check for `hover: hover` as I did there, it means that the styles in the block only work on a device where the browser can issue mouse-hover messages.  If you check for `hover: none`, then the styles only work where the user *can't* issue those messages.  In other words, the table of contents will only show up off to the side on desktop browsers---and mobile browsers where the user has set some hover-emulation---where the user can actually hover[^1].

[^1]: If you read through the RSS feed, then you miss out on the stylesheet and so the table of contents shows up at the top of the page, regardless of your device.

I did the same for the "pull-out trays" for the recommended posts on the index pages and the newsletter sign-up form on post pages, replacing the awful width hack that I previously used.

### Direct Linking

On top of that, I added a feature that might prove useful for somebody, *or* it might go completely unused forever.  And you might have already noticed it.

Look above the previous paragraph, to the heading.  Look to the right.  Do you see the link {% emoji link %} emoji?  If you hover over it, you'll notice that it acts as a hyperlink to the current section.  Therefore, if you ever wanted to share a post with somebody, but focus their attention on a particular section, then you could right-click on the emoji, select *Copy Link* from the menu, and pass that along instead of the post's more general URL and a lengthy explanation of where to check.

I didn't actually write (much) code for this.  Instead, I used [**Jekyll Anchor Headings**](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-anchor-headings) and updated the layout for blog posts to use it, which means that---unlike the Tables of Contents, for example, or adding explanatory blurbs in certain kinds of posts as arises below---this shows up *retroactively*, meaning that you get the linkable titles equally on posts that I haven't written yet as you do on posts from four years ago.

## Entropy Arbitrage...but the Posts, Now

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage %}

Speaking of adding explanatory blurbs to old posts, I started propagating the "What do we mean by *less well*?" blurbs to older [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub) posts.

To my chagrin, I don't see a practical way of doing this automatically, because I've started adding them manually to *new* posts, long enough ago that I'd rather not spend half an hour trying to work out the optimal `sed` command to insert the call to the plugin after the *What Works...Less Well?* header, only to spend another hour or two manually checking the work and deleting the duplicates in posts that I've already touched.

Regardless of all that mess, I've done batches of six-months' worth at a time, and have reached 2022.

## The Light's Edge

{% codeberg jcolag/thelightsedge %}

I have finally brought Fort Sheridan up to date, with a Fediverse account on [@fortsheridan@miraiverse.xyz](https://miraiverse.xyz/fortsheridan), after never hearing back from the original site where I planned to put their account.  Presumably, they rejected my application---it would make sense, since this sort of project, especially for a fictional military base, comes precariously close to inherently violating fairly typical moderation rules, such as not posting disinformation (the account *will* post fictional posts in the superficial guise of United States Army officials) and not supporting violent ideologies (like support of military action, perhaps?)---but who really knows?  And it doesn't really matter, since the Fediverse has plenty of room.

I looked at quite a few alternatives, but a surprising number of non-Mastodon servers have a connectivity problem that prevents people from signing up to the community.

Anyway, Miraiverse had its act together, so the new---and final, at least for the first batch---account lives there.

## Fictopedia Archive

{% codeberg jcolag/fictopedia %}

As promised---or maybe threatened, who can remember...---I have started going through each page to fix the inter-entry links to make sure that they don't point to impossible pages.  I can accept that they'll link to pages that don't exist, but strongly dislike that the conversion by Pandoc fouled up a lot of the URLs.

While there, I have also started adding explicit statements of the license to each entry, so that people don't land in the middle of things and get lost.

I have only gotten to the letter *D*, so far.  Less than one letter per day seems almost too slow to bother, but I hope that once I get into the swing of things, it'll move faster.

## Next

For the upcoming week, I would expect me to continue cleaning up blog posts---adding the "Less Well" explanation and then adding tables of contents---and continuing to clean up the Fictopedia posts.  In other words, I'll have a lot to do, with little to no code changes unless I spot something to fix in the recent CSS changes.
