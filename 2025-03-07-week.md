As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > One takeaway is the importance of these unique communication styles, where individual dance mannerisms enhance communication success. If every bee communicated the same, the likelihood of foragers reaching the food would decrease as compared to having a diverse set of styles.

Yep.  Even in beehives where nobody comes from outside the "family," diversity still improves results.

 > In time of war as in time of peace, the Negro woman has ever been ready to serve for her people's and the nation's good. During the recent World War she pleaded to go in the uniform of the Red Cross nurse and was denied the opportunity only on the basis of racial distinction.

 > Quiroz said that grassroots organizations will continue to take the lead and work alongside the community to push the protests forward. He said the protests are building on Los Angelesâ€™ rich history of Chicano activism, which includes the East LA walkouts for equal education and the March 2006 student walkouts in support of immigrant rights.

 > Research also finds that truth-in-sentencing laws cause far-reaching harms to people convicted of crimes and to society at large, undermining both rehabilitation and public safety.

Hashtags:  #Prison #Inequality #Rehabilitation

I don't know if I've done so in a blog post, but in my personal life, I often use the prison system as a perfect example of how to build a "good" system that makes every aspect of society worse, because nobody ever bothered to ask what we *actually* want it to do.  If we don't know what purpose prisons should serve, then tinkering with the details will never improve anything.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114110913617727935)

 > All the dispossessed and pariahs of society are on the move; they beg for some light, air, and a life that accords with human dignity. It is therefore only natural that, in our century, a serious and vast movement has emerged among the last and most numerous of pariahs who form half of humanity-that is, women.

I've said it elsewhere, but we should probably stop electing the people who insist that government doesn't serve the people, since they *always* try to make their assertions come true when they get into office, rather than trying to improve anything.

 > Delays and underpayments can result in significant financial hardship and emotional strain. Families face out-of-pocket expenses for temporary housing, repairs, and secondary damage (like mold growth). These can increase debt and lower credit scores, ultimately making mortgage and other routine obligations more difficult or even impossible to meet.

I would note that this fight needs to happen against the background of the aforementioned dismantling of the administrative state, which might normally back people.

 > We judge from experience that man is a gregarious animal, and instinctively affiliates with his kind co-operates, unites in groups, works to better advantage, combined with his fellow men than when alone. This would point to the formation of co-operative communities, of which our present trades-unions are embryonic patterns.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why including people with disabilities in the workforce and higher education benefits everyone](https://theconversation.com/why-including-people-with-disabilities-in-the-workforce-and-higher-education-benefits-everyone-249676) from The Conversation

 > Blaming failures on people with disabilities and people of color echoes the [harms embedded in eugenics](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/546347), an attempt to scientifically prove genetic inferiority of disabled, LGBTQ+ Indigenous and Black people.

I don't need to say anything about this, right?  We can all nod in agreement and move on, I imagine.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Funkwhale Wants to Filter Out Far-Right Music](https://wedistribute.org/2025/02/funkwhale-filter/) from We Distribute

 > Future versions of Funkwhale are pushing to require all uploaded tracks to have [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) data associated with them. If the track is missing a MusicBrainz ID or incorrectly using a different ID, that track may be filtered out of network discovery and possibly not even federate to other Funkwhale servers.

I understand the skepticism in the article, but also...yeah, don't let them recruit---and art *always* recruits, even if the artist didn't realize or care about where their work would drive receptive people---on "the Commons."  If they don't like it, then they can run instances with the code changed and beg users to follow them over.  If we need to split hairs over "how far right can your tags go," then that sounds like a good problem to have, because it means that the underlying premise works.
