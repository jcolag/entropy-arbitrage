As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[Posted to Cohost ü•öüêõ:  *Complaining about Modern Star Trek*](https://cohost.org/jcolag/post/1135997-complaining-about-mo)

 > I've found myself thinking a lot about why **Star Trek: Picard** (and a lot of modern *Star Trek*) feels so...empty, and a few other people posting about it convinced me that I should air my thoughts somewhere other than the newsletter adjunct to my blog. And word of warning, it got a little out of control.

This post ran *so* far out of control, in fact, that I wrote more than two thousand words on the topic, so I won't clutter *this* post by copying it all in.  You'll need to read it there, if you want my full thoughts.  I get into a broad history of the politics of the franchise, the specific points in the modern shows where it feels like they've given up, and (briefly) the distinction between wishing that the franchise would return to its progressive roots and objecting to the shows for daring to have a diverse cast.

The article has a list of possible reasons of why this might happen, which seems like the more interesting story.

Hashtags:  #Iran #HumanRights

I almost find it difficult to believe that the Iranian government has hung on for so long.  They don't seem to have anybody's respect, or even all that much money, plus continuing protests that they keep making *worse*.  On top of that, the entire (bogus) Islamic Republic concept rests on the shoulders of a single elderly man with no viable successors.  By now, I'd expect their leaders to have fled the country, by now.

 > The globalization and automation of the bicycle industry make bikes less sustainable.

Hashtags:  #Bicycles #Sustainability

Personally, I never developed a good relationship with bicycles, and part of that comes from how cheap they all feel.  A while back, I looked into "open hardware" bicycles, as you could probably guess, but they often either seem even flimsier or require an existing bicycle frame or heavy machinery.  I ended up buying an electric scooter, if anybody has a desperate need for that story to have closure.  Once I learned to ride it, it seems fine, though it admittedly probably makes the least-sustainable option...

 > This International Women's Day, let's take a moment to reflect on how...y'know, the celebration originated in American Socialist circles, and so of course the West stomped it out, and therefore the only countries that celebrate it are former Soviet republics and a smattering of Asian and African countries. Oh, and then we've spent over a hundred years moaning and complaining whenever women asked for rights.
 >
 > Seriously, let's reflect on that, and...maybe stop doing it? Please.

What can I say?  I felt momentarily inspired, and I like how it turned out.  Less so, that we refuse to take women's right seriously and have a party excited for the opportunity to roll those rights back.

Even if (presumably male) readers somehow can't get behind gender equality for its own sake, consider that every stress mostly specific to living life as a man *derives from* some restriction placed on women.  Why do most job-related deaths and injuries harm men?  We harass and threaten women into leaving those positions.  Why do people judge men based on how much money we make, especially when discussing relationships?  Women earn significantly less than men.  Why do people grow suspicious of men who engage with children?  We consider child-care the responsibility of women.  I should probably haul out my old Quora posts and put together a full blog post on this, honestly.

We've always considered Europa a candidate for hosting water, but this still sounds like a wild possibility.

Hashtags:  #Capitalism

This confirms what I've seen in other studies (that I unfortunately can't find), that most of our time "at work" doesn't amount to anything, and that twenty to thirty hours marks the point where productivity drops sharply.  In other words, white-collar workers spend almost half their weeks spinning their wheels, so it makes perfect sense that cutting the work-week closer to that balancing point would make everybody happier.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I generally ignore the UK, admittedly, but this issue raises some points that apply globally.

 > They'll argue that we don't have the money for the expanded Child Tax Credit that largely benefited working class constituents --- remember, not one Republican voted for it. But more than 70 Republicans just introduced a bill to make the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy permanent. So it's not about money --- it's about who benefits from it.

In fact, Republicans have made it abundantly clear---by keeping people in debt, doing nothing about rising prices, and cutting services---that they care primarily about forcing people to compete for jobs.  The same people who believe that we shouldn't teach kids about slavery want to force them to work for decades.  Go figure...
