## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Holiday Time

For those not aware, in the United States, Thanksgiving comes on a Thursday, so around here, that means that they coincide with the *Star Trek* posts.  Coincidentally, more than one past year has landed on a miserable enough episode to give me the opportunity for a turkey joke.  This time, though, we have an entire series ending, which seems like a good opportunity to actually give thanks.

Legitimate:  Thanks for all of you reading along, whether this far along from the beginning or still finding the posts.  I'd probably still do it without you, but I'd probably have less fun at it...

Less Legitimate:  I appreciate that these shows have become so much more widely available over the past few years.  Near the start of these posts, if one service broke an episode or had a similar problem, it took effort to track down an alternative.  Now, you can probably find the episodes almost anywhere, *plus* you have a couple of Free Ad-Supported Television streams that'll cycle through almost any of the older shows every few days.

Petty:  I feel extremely grateful that I can go back to a world where I don't watch this show, and can soon mostly stop thinking about this crew[^A261oc] entirely...

[^A261oc]:  Except for the characters who keep showing up like the proverbial bad penny, as if their performers do nothing but sit around Paramount making sad puppy dog eyes at anybody involved in the franchise.

Anyway, to those (still) celebrating, have a happy Thanksgiving.  To those not, enjoy whatever you have on your plate, and cross your fingers that I didn't foul up this post too much when I pulled it together.

## Next Generation Season 7 Summary

I don't think that I have anything particularly interesting to say about this season, other than how a lot of the subtext that I have picked up on for six years prior has increasingly become text.  I won't go too deeply into that right now, because I should probably save it for the final cast summary after the films.

For now, though, I'll point out that, while the show has always had the occasional off-handed callous comment about somebody's plight, this season has explicitly presented us with multiple ongoing problems that...we shouldn't worry about, because we won't ever get to know anybody directly affected.  We see corruption, but they arrest somebody who doesn't have his name in the credits, so don't worry about that, either.  They shuffled their "pet refugee" off somewhere else so that we wouldn't need to worry about that crisis, and then brought her back to make her a turncoat, in hopes that we would stop caring.  And everything has turned into brinksmanship, where we *should* worry about non-humans wanting the Federation to take their needs seriously.

And it all culminates (at least so far) in a hypothetical thirtieth (or so) season, where the crew finally tells Picard where he can stuff his sociopathic mind-games...

## Conclusions

As I did with the original cast seasons, unlike the discussions of individual episodes, I'll skip the judgment calls and instead break everything down by field of practice.

Before we get moving, as usual, I feel it worth a reminder that *Star Trek* doesn't show our future.  We see deviations in the timeline, especially when the writers try to predict their futures.  I won't collect them---many people have picked apart the franchise timeline and decided how to resolve the contradictions, including the studio itself---but I wanted to make that point clear early.

### Training and Professionalism

Some leaders actually work with compassion[^D2] [^LD], though we see that the aggressive, dismissive approach to dealing with peers starts early in their careers[^D2].  Most continue to lead primarily through intimidation[^G1] [^A], despite knowing that it doesn't work[^G1], while some have taken to ignoring their reports[^LD].  Much of their effort goes to balancing personal loyalty with strict social hierarchy against ethical concerns[^I1] [^A] [^Pe] [^EB] [^PS] [^A1] [^A2], believing that they have never had a mutiny[^Pe], with some leaders even instituting loyalty celebrations, though Starfleet appears to find it mystifying[^Pe].

When that personal loyalty begins to weaken, leaders threaten to destroy careers[^Pe] [^PS].

Hierarchies even seem to affect their emotions, expressing more grief over the presumed death of a boss than for thousands of colleagues[^G1].  People also dismiss rules for the minions when those rules might affect them[^G1] [^Pe] [^G], with others ignoring their infractions[^G2], with some thinking that rules shouldn't affect the powerful[^G2]; the same seems to apply to how they view the right to take risks[^FN].  At least certain leaders even insist that they want to work with people willing to push back on their ideas, but also don't accept such criticism[^Pe], and seem to resent ambitious subordinates[^Pa] [^G].

At least in Starfleet, candidates advance through tests designed to traumatize them and verify that they can send colleagues to their deaths[^TOS].  But people from disadvantaged backgrounds find it difficult to land a promotion in some of (allegedly) the most prominent positions in the organization[^PS].

We also see that subordinates don't seem to have a right or duty to disobey unethical or illegal orders[^G2] [^JE], with morality only interesting when it affects leaders[^Pe].  And leaders even "confidentially" evaluate their reports in front of them[^LD].

Many also see soothing their superiors' egos as part of their jobs[^G2] [^A] [^A2], giving the boss credit for any of their ideas[^G2].  However, everyone seems to find association with leaders objectionable, little more than an irritation to endure[^Ph] [^JE].

Civilians also find claims of institutional authority sufficient evidence to trust people[^G2].

Corruption runs rampant, though, with factions that oppose treaties that limit their actions[^Pe], leaks of classified information occurring through peer pressure[^Pe], "friends in high places" helping the powerful evade justice or retaliate for it[^Pe], helping colleagues cheat on tests for advancement[^TOS], or appropriating government resources for personal projects[^B] [^A1] including terrorism[^PS].  People widely dismiss any claims of illegal behavior, though, even when confronted with the evidence[^PS].

Workers can always find time or some excuse to play games while on duty[^L] [^A1], and will wait for formal confirmation before proceeding with plans to save lives[^Pe] or deliberately propose unworkable solutions[^H], though also find it natural to condemn others for not taking situations sufficiently seriously[^L].

They also seem to focus on irrelevant issues while ignoring serious problems[^H] [^EB] [^A1].  They similarly don't pay attention, asking unnecessary questions or zoning out[^EB] [^G] [^A1].  And they also can't seem to keep a secret in tense situations[^JE] or prepare in any meaningful way[^E].

### Economics

People seem to dislike their jobs, rather than working for personal satisfaction[^LD] [^TOS], often not understanding why someone would want a job that involves more work[^TOS].  Civilians believe that Starfleet officers do love their jobs, and that Starfleet exploits that enjoyment[^LD].  Many people of lower classes need to use their work to justify their existence[^B], and the upper classes don't hide their sense of superiority[^A1].

Starfleet also continues to look like a playground for the wealthy[^JE].  And we see evidence of severe inequality, with some feeling guilty for not engaging in family business interests and others caught up in petty theft and violence[^B], with an assumption that those two worlds would never cross[^B].  Probably related, people widely believe that people from central Federation worlds have such comfortable lives that they would never commit a crime or leave the Federation[^G2] [^PS].

At least the affluent on planets such as Earth get around cities in floating ground vehicles[^A1].

#### Colonization

Residents of colonies have no say in the fates of their homes, with the Federation trading them away without consultation[^JE], only allowing for objections after the fact[^JE].  Colonists may also lose citizenship, if they find their homes traded to another government[^JE].

### Science and Technology

They appear to trust their technology implicitly, unable to imagine bad outcomes[^FN], despite all the failures, even believing that random deactivation of systems wouldn't harm anybody[^H], unable to even imagine somebody exploring without excessive safety equipment[^B].  Much of the Federation also doesn't bother to maintain equipment required for their safety[^SR].  Perhaps related, they strongly object to the idea of nature imposing limits on what they can do[^FN], resembling the insistence that nature exists for humans to exploit it.

They still refuse to acknowledge the signs of consciousness in their computer systems[^E].

They will enact environmental regulation, but only in the weakest form that they can manage[^FN], and quickly find or create emergencies that allow them to bypass those rules[^Pe] [^H] [^EB] [^B].

Professionals consider normal operation of equipment to include incorrect results[^Pa].  And they reject reporting of any experiences outside their shared understanding[^Pa].

People generally see stealth technology as an offensive weapon[^Pe] [^A2].

The understanding of sciences, such as evolution, seem to derive from pseudoscience such as eugenics[^G].

#### Design

The culture seems to form its technology with an extremely narrow range of users in mind, not allowing for much variation in species or ability, specifically in cases of audio reproduction[^Ph] and temperature[^G].  Similarly, voice recognition seems to have difficulty with accents[^A1].

User interfaces continue to not make any sense[^Pa].

#### Health Care

We continue to see a strong stigma against disability, with both ableist terminology[^L] [^H] [^A1] and ableist jokes[^L] used.  They also readily dismiss the experiences of their colleagues with disabilities[^I1], still using them as convenient objects[^I1].

Therapy continues to seem disinterested in the patient or their needs[^I1], even openly dismissing some patients' experiences[^Ph] [^SR] [^EB].  Although it also finds embracing darker urges compelling[^Ph] with predictable results.  Maybe related, at least some people have walked away from their therapists and replaced them with computer software[^Ph].  Therapists seem disinterested in criticism[^SR] or engaging with actual psychological illness[^EB], though some seem to understand that they don't do much other than send people to play games[^A1].

People also don't seem to understand depression and suicide, characterizing it as a transient sadness of the weak that people can shock them out of or quietly fix on their own[^EB].

Health professionals seem to avoid educating their patients about how their bodies should work[^DP].  They also ignore symptoms of illness common for their female patients' demographic[^I2].  And the entire field apparently has a reputation for ignoring broader wellbeing beyond drug-based treatments[^SR].

Cosmetic procedures still exist for seemingly casual decisions[^SR], and they solve many problems by forcibly drugging people[^A1].

#### Academia

Many show an insistence that schoolwork doesn't apply to real situations[^D2] [^LD] [^TOS].  They also seem to put little thought into their decisions or exploration into their preferences[^L].  That seems to go along with the usual anti-intellectual movement, dismissing any uncomfortable new information[^FN].  Many seem to object to the idea that they should know how anything works[^TOS] [^M] [^B] [^A2], and don't grasp that narrowing the scope of a search saves them time[^B] [^A2].

They also seem to have no qualms about destroying important cultural artifacts, if they suspect that somebody might turn it into a weapon[^G2] [^M].  Everybody also finds it acceptable for wealthy self-important people to interfere with important archaeological sites[^F] [^B].

Their science apparatus prioritizes respectability politics, at least internationally, ignoring the findings of foreigners who haven't "gone through the proper channels," while making time to (partly) listen to their colleagues who avoid inconveniencing anybody[^FN].

In the liberal arts, people seem to frequently misattribute or misunderstand artistic works that they claim to find important[^G2] [^DP] [^I2].  They also quickly judge other cultures as primitive because of nothing more than the presence of stone-like artifacts[^M].  But they also misstate science[^A2].

People don't appear to have an understanding the others will know different information than they do[^Pe] [^E] [^A2], have difficulty understanding uncommon turns of phrase[^LD], and can't imagine representing invisible phenomena in physical forms or really understanding physical phenomena[^M].

### Crime

We see a suggestion that the Federation dismisses local criminal activity by misidentifying offenders as foreign[^G2].  And many believe that residents of central Federation worlds would never commit a crime or leave the Federation[^G2] [^PS].

### Government, Law, and Corrections

Police violence at least sounds credible enough to foreigners that the threat of it causes them to cooperate with probes[^G1].  In fact, we even see violations of civil liberties under the pretext of enforcing minor regulations against a foreign national[^G2], suggesting that the aggrieved parties can file a complaint if they don't like it[^G2].

The Federation continues to seem fragile, with secessionist factions even on central worlds[^G2].

They also seem to use mass arrests to suppress dissent frequently enough that people don't find it peculiar[^G2].

The Prime Directive continues to mystify everybody[^H], though they mostly agree that it serves as an excuse for not helping foreigners who need it[^H].

Starfleet officers can demand that local officials verify their authority[^SR], and the Federation uses Starfleet to force citizens to comply with "requests"[^JE], with Starfleet seeing itself as having authority over and a duty to control the Federation's civilians[^PS].

### Religion

Starfleet appears to arrange funerals based on the dominant culture among a crew, rather than the preferences of those most affected[^I1].

Mention of even literary representations of an afterlife make everybody feel  uncomfortable[^DP].  And we see a belief that individuals and cultures have an intrinsic purpose to their lives that they should fulfill[^E].

### Family

People feel pressure to either marry within their identity groups or escape their families[^I2].

The presence of family members surprises many people[^I2] [^H].

We still see the pressure that children feel, feeling like people expect them to make art with technical perfection[^M] or choosing the careers in childhood[^F], though some recognize that the insistence on excelling may have gone too far[^JE].

The wealthy can trace their family histories for over a thousand years, but those histories quietly whitewash the actions of relatives who participated in atrocities[^JE].

#### Gender Roles

We see distinct hints that women have a lower status to men[^D2] [^L] [^DP] [^I2] [^SR] [^LD] [^A1], and even wearing something with a loose similarity to women's clothing makes many men uncomfortable[^L].

Men also seem to at least feel comfortable pretending to police their female relatives' sexual activity[^G1], and culture in general wants to police the actions of older women[^DP] [^I2] [^Pa] [^SR] or look forward to replacing their social roles with mechanical processes[^I2], often seeing them as little more than potential incubators for fetuses[^G].

We have continued to see the rush to judge women for not seeming sufficiently friendly to men[^G1] [^A] [^SR], and interject into conversations about topics that they don't understand[^DP] [^FN].  They still believe that mature women have no actual role in society, dismissing their concerns[^DP].

We see women expected to handle emotional labor for powerful men[^A] [^LD] [^A1], and pressured to discuss their libidos with them[^SR].  Men also get to consider themselves victims when women suffer, because they can't know if they deserve the career advancement[^LD].  They also expect women to predict all manner of unlikely outcomes[^G].

Many believe that forcing or manipulating women into relationships makes them happy[^SR], and some chose to leave romantic gifts for their exes even after rejection[^M] or consider men to have some ownership over their exes[^EB] [^A1], though some at least loosely understand consent[^EB] [^A1].

Largely, actual heterosexual romantic relationships seem to exist for the man's gratification[^A1] [^A2], with rivalries stopping the relationship[^A1], with women expected to not move on at all[^A2].

Outsiders spot all this as toxic masculinity[^DP] [^JE].

#### Sex

Men seem to see themselves as pursuers in romantic relationships, but hate it when women pursue them[^Ph].  They also deny any responsibility in or guilt for constructing elaborate fantasies about women who they know that violate the women's boundaries[^A].

They find nudity and sexuality extremely uncomfortable[^I2] [^SR].

#### Race Relations and Nationalism

Artificial creatures still don't appear to have any rights[^D2] [^I2].  People can casually execute them without a trial for offenses committed beyond Federation space[^D2], if they believe that the suspect might eventually cause more trouble, and some people might (unclear evidence) cover up the existence of such people to protect them[^I2].  People also push stereotypes about androids despite clear evidence to the contrary[^Ph], object to their accommodating "lesser" creatures[^FN], and a partial admission that people see artificial life as less valuable than its organic counterpart[^I2].

Likewise, nobody has any qualms about insulting Klingons[^L] [^G1] [^Pa] and ignoring their concerns[^Pa].  The Federation may also translate the Klingon language to reinforce preconceptions of their culture[^Pa] [^F], and see that culture as raw material to fit into forms that they know better[^Pa], but find Klingon names for children objectionable[^Pa], and people expect them to have a perfect idiomatic grasp of English[^A1].  Klingon children in the Federation also find themselves unwelcome and excluded from mainstream society[^F].

Bajorans have also become targets, with people suggesting that the occupation should undermine their faith[^LD], object to the use of their idioms[^LD], push them around as "tests"[^LD] [^PS], and make it difficult for them to advance their careers[^PS].

Non-human leaders have their legitimacy questioned[^SR], and Cardassians living in Federation space become scapegoats for violence[^PS].  Similarly, at least in the future, they cheer the deaths of hundreds of non-humans[^A2].

This shows in the continued idea of seeing foreign foods as disgusting[^F], as well, and judging foreigners by human standards despite ignoring human behavior[^F] [^PS].

Many see human identity as so valuable that maintaining a false identity has a higher priority than learning or accepting the truth[^I2], and see humans as separate from the rest of the galaxy[^JE] [^PS], concerned more about limiting human-on-human violence than any other conflicts[^PS], and don't seem to care about the fate of any other species in a galactic disaster[^A2].

However, we also see a dismissal of the experiences of non-white humans[^I1], with many humans having a strong interest in their specific narrow ethnicity[^LD], especially among those with lighter skin.  The Federation also uses troubling colonial-era names for the descendants of oppressed populations and minimize their cultures[^JE].

Maybe not quite "race relations," but we see some terrible treatment of pets, this season, as well, with no interest in understanding the needs or health of their charges[^Ph] [^FN] [^G], possibly including medical experimentation on those pets[^G].

#### International Relations

People broadly frown on diplomacy[^L] [^A].  They find it reasonable to repeat stereotypes about foreigners such as the Ferengi[^I1].

They also like to blame the Romulans for any problems[^G1] [^G2] [^Pe] [^A1], even wanting to deprive them of even outdated technology[^Pe], sometimes dropping the issue abruptly when they learn of a connection closer to home[^G2], but disappointed when they can't solve their problems through violence[^Pe] [^A1].  We also see stereotypes that Romulans scavenge technology rather than inventing anything[^Pe], and that the Federation doesn't believe that the Romulan government (or any successor state) has the right to police their space[^A1] [^A2].

Cardassians face outright hatred, even among civilians[^PS].

Foreign nationals appear subject to casual threats of police violence[^G1] [^JE] [^F] [^PS] or accuse them of causing any problems that may have occurred during their visits[^DP] [^FN].  When shaken down, they also have no protection beyond writing a complaint after the fact[^G2].

Nobody sees local governments as having any authority[^G1] [^A] [^M] [^B] [^PS], often considering them likely corrupt without any evidence[^G1] or tasking them with work[^B].  They also seem to claim the right to shut down foreign businesses that bother them[^PS].  Even when they can afford some respect for a local government, they prefer to only deal with global governments, no matter how they unified the planet[^A].  They also seem comfortable appropriating other cultures and centering themselves in those narratives[^M].

Perhaps similarly, when faced with novel forms of life that may have saved their lives, they rush to find a means of extermination, only reluctantly trying to understand and communicate with them[^Ph] [^E].  They also seem to consider abandoning rescue of new creatures because they may have had some involvement with deaths[^I1] or really for no reason[^H] [^E] [^A2].  In general, they still show a deep love of exerting power over aliens[^FN] [^Pe] [^H] [^M] [^JE] [^E], and see watching a non-Federation world die as honoring the former population, though they also don't see that through[^H].

The Federation has a reputation for covertly forming military alliances against third parties while negotiating with those third parties[^A].  Many also see them as undertaking biased investigations and show trials[^PS], as well and easy to provoke into a war[^A1].  They also appear to take credit for the creation of natural features of the galaxy[^FN] and show opposition to international cooperation for the common good[^FN].

And unsurprisingly with that, they believe that ships must stay prepared for combat at all times[^LD] [^G] [^F].

While not consistent, the Federation does see at least one treaty important enough to enforce in its borders[^Pe].

The Federation occasionally sees defectors, people who see a less-developed culture as a better home for them[^H].  Many defectors, especially among privileged classes, instead crave a war and see an opportunity to start one[^PS].

### Popular Culture

They seem to know early Modern English literature other than Shakespeare, but specifically works often confused with Shakespeare's[^G2] [^EB], though Shakespeare remains popular[^E].

People also have some awareness of John Milton's work, but dismiss it as poetry and don't seem to have any actual understanding of it[^DP].

Folk songs have at least some popularity, as well[^DP], plus adaptations of Handel[^I2].

Some seem to believe that the arts have strict rules to follow to produce anything valid[^Pa].

#### Socialization

People appear to form shallow relationships on the principles of a single shared interest[^L].

Many people seem to have poor impulse control[^L], craving dangerous situations to test themselves[^B].  They do, however, make an exception for grief, which they suppress until it overwhelms them[^I1] [^G1] or they can see to their emotions in private[^I1] [^FN] [^B] and insist that everybody quickly put aside for material reasons[^I1] [^FN] [^B].  Occasionally, though, they can bring themselves to mourn a friend's death[^LD].

Humans insist that they have evolved past war and violence[^G2], despite people keeping weapons in their quarters[^Ph] and believing in a need to turn children into warriors[^F].

Privacy seems gone[^LD] [^B], with mild lateness prompting searches of the offender's bedroom[^Ph] and monitoring sexual activities feels like fair game[^Pa], with some employers even seemingly maintaining full dossiers on workers[^A1], though some feel reluctant about revealing their ages[^Pa] and seem to dislike thinking about people's biological activities[^G].  They don't monitor their pets, however[^LD] [^G].

People crave higher status and dominance over their peers[^FN] [^Pa] [^LD] [^TOS] [^G] [^E] [^PS] [^A2], and they envision a future where people realize and no longer appreciate the manipulation[^A2].

#### Fashion

The Federation doesn't seem to customize clothing[^L], and doesn't manufacture the clothing for comfort across conditions[^SR].

#### History

The Federation whitewashes the history of colonization and ethnic cleansing[^JE], and powerful people don't believe that they bear any responsibility for the problems that their ancestors caused and that they profit from[^JE].

Similarly, they seem to think that artists understood how future generations would identify and characterize their time[^E].

## Stay Tuned...

Having wrapped the series, come back next week as we start digging through the cast's films.  As mentioned, we'll split them across multiple weeks to not over-burden things, so expect next week to cover the first half of **Generations**...after the [original cast's part]({% post_url 2022-04-28-generations %}) covered a couple of years back.
