Like I mentioned back [on Monday]({% post_url 2020-07-27-kwvad %}), I decided to spend some time over the last week updating the repositories I use regularly to use a `main` branch instead of `master`, since the latter has unpleasant an alienating connotations.

![Branches](/blog/assets/tree-nature-branch-winter-black-and-white-plant-997803-pxhere.com-1.png "Branches")

Before you tell me that it "obviously" derives from a different meaning, keep in mind that [git](https://git-scm.com/) takes a lot of its ideas from [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper), which includes the concept of a master branch with slave branches.  Likewise, if you're going to argue that it's from "master copy," I have some awful news for you...

Similarly, if you're going to ask why it's suddenly important...that's a good question, because this sort of terminology should *never* have been acceptable, and it's embarrassing that we need to be reminded that our choice of words has consequences.  But since everybody is thinking about it now, it's a good time to do it, rather than sheepishly operating the minority of repositories that didn't bother.

In other words, the best time to fix a mistake is always **now**, because you can't fix anything before now and waiting until later just leaves the mistake where it is.

## Altering the Branch

Plus, regardless of the intent, it's *still* an uncomfortable term to have around, and it can easily give the impression that the project (and industry as a whole) isn't ready to welcome certain kinds of people.  So, I'm going to change it where I can.  Because I have dozens of repositories floating around, I decided to get it right once and then move the information to a script to make it reproducible.  Here's the final version for GitHub, in case anybody wants to play along.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
branchpath=/settings/branches
url=$(grep 'url = ' .git/config | \
      cut -f2- -d'=' | \
      sed 's/^ *//g' | \
      sed 's/\.git *$//g' )
if case $url in git@*) true;; *) false;; esac
then
  url=$(echo $url | \
        sed 's/:/\//g' | \
        sed 's/^git@/https:\/\//g')
fi
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
echo Go update the default "${url}${branchpath}"
echo Then run:
echo git push origin --delete master
```

It doesn't have any error checking, so don't run it outside your repository's local root folder, where you have administrative control over the remote/upstream repository.

The `url` variable digs into the git configuration file to find the `remote` repository.  I hate the syntax, but if the `url` we find starts with `git@`, modify it to a real GitHub URL instead of GitHub's `git@github.com:name/project.git` format.  All the pieces are there, of course.  The `case` syntax looks like a mess, but it works without any special cases to compare the names.

Then we have two `git` commands.  The first moves (`-m`) or renames the `master` branch to `main`.  Next, we `push` the new branch and set the upstream (`-u`) to point to it.  At this point, the local repository only has a `main` branch and is set to work exclusively with the remote `main` branch.

Why `main` and not `trunk`, `primary`, or something else entirely?  When I change branches (not that I have many public-facing branches), muscle-memory is still `git branch m` and then let the shell handle auto-completion.  You can call yours what you want, obviously, and even update the script to default to a name if you don't provide it with one.

However, there are still two (manual) steps remaining.  Over the GitHub page, the default branch still reads **<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> master <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i>**, so someone needs to change it by hand.  So, that `url` work the script did earlier pays off, producing a link to `https://github.com/name/project/settings/branches`, where the user can update the default.  Obviously, I make no claims about the URL being correct for any host other than GitHub.  I really should start looking at GitLab; they seem like a nice company that people should pay some attention to.

Once that's done, you can delete the `master` branch entirely and never worry about it again...except for the rest of this post, because there are still some edge cases.

I'm not currently running any CI/CD, but if you choose to work with this script and do, you should take a minute and make sure that it never explicitly references the `master` branch in any of its work.

### Advanced

It finally dawned on me that this should *probably* be handled through GitHub's API, so that the entire experience is just running a script.  I didn't feel like digging into it for *this* post, because learning how to make and handle API calls takes this from a "quick script" to a full application that needs to handle remote authentication and all the possible error states.  So, I wasn't going down that path...until I remembered that GitHub has [a CLI tool](https://cli.github.com/).

Installing that takes care of the "application" part of this.  And with some research, I was able to work out how change the default branch *entirely* through the tool.

```console
gh api repos/the-user/the-repository -X PATCH
  -F name="the-repository" \
  -F default_branch="main"
```

Obviously, change `the-user` and `the-repository` (both instances) to yours.  But now that we have this piece of information, we can replace the `echo` lines above with the following.

```sh
user=$(echo "${url}" | cut -f4 -d'/')
repo=$(echo "${url}" | cut -f5 -d'/')
gh api repos/${user}/${repo} -X PATCH -F name="${repo}" -F default_branch="main"
git push origin --delete master
```

We know that a repository URL is going to look like `https://github.com/the-user/the-repository/`, so we pull off the fourth and fifth items, as delimited by slashes.  The first is `https:`, the second is empty, and so forth.

Then, we call the GitHub CLI tool.  The first time you successfully call it, it will ask you to hit <span class="kbd">Enter</span> to open GitHub in a browser.  There, you can authorize the tool to operate on your behalf.  Then, once you're authenticated, the script continues on to delete the branch.

Except for the one-time authentication step, there are no manual steps.  I call that a success.

## Local Clones

The above won't work for a clone, because that work is primarily administrative.  If you have a clone of a project that has been making changes like this (for example, those of my projects that have migrated over), you'll see something like this.

```console
From url-to-repository
 * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master'
from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
```

The above script won't work, because it wants to affect the origin.  Instead, you need something more streamlined, like the following.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
git checkout master
git branch -m master main
git fetch
git branch --unset-upstream
git branch -u origin/main
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```

This makes sure that you start out on the `master` branch (to make sure that you don't break a different branch), moves/renames the branch as above, gets the latest commits from upstream, unlinks the upstream repository, links the new branch upstream (almost as above, though not quite), and finally updates the clone's local default branch.

Like above, run it in the clone's root folder and don't expect the script to recover easily if there are any errors.

## Never Again...

It would, of course, be nice if we never needed to see a `master` branch again.  Most of us don't yet have the ability to just tell `git` that we never want a repository with one, but we can create a decent alias to use instead of `git init` until we do.

```console
git config --global alias.new '!git init && git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main'
```

Now, we can call `git new` to initialize our repositories and the alias will create it and set the default branch name.

That's not an ideal situation, since muscle memory will inevitably type the default command that we can't override.  But as a temporary measure, it should work out for most cases until the latest version of `git` shows up.  To prepare for that, you might as well configure things now.

```console
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

When Git 2.28 comes to your platform (Ubuntu is still on v2.25, for example), it will pick up that option and all of your new local repositories will have default branches with your custom name.
