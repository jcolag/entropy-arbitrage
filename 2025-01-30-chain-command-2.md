In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Chain of Command, Part 2

We left off [last week]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}), you'll probably recall, with Picard captured by the Cardassians for interrogation, while the *Enterprise* crew hates their new ~~father figure~~ boss.  We'll probably skip most of the interrogation bits---almost certainly the parts that you come to the episode for---because they fall more on the character-driven side than anything that might care about cultural issues.

 > **LEMEC**: Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Worf, and Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on Celtris Three, attacked one of our outposts in a brutal assault, and killed over fifty-five men, women and children.

This line feels damning in how (I imagine) we all actually needed to think back to last week to remember if they showed us fifty-something deaths.  Maybe Lemec chose to lie about this, but also...raise your hand if you *can't* imagine those deaths happening as a side effect of their actions, with Picard lecturing Crusher after the fact about how they can't waste precious time worrying about the consequences of their actions and how she needs to keep her emotions in check.  They didn't, but...did they?

 > **JELLICO**: Captain Picard and the others were sent to investigate reports of a metagenic weapon on Celtris Three. It's possible that they may have been captured. But if they did escape, they'll head for the Lyshan system. The *Enterprise* is supposed to meet them there in eight hours. Will, I want you to take a shuttle-craft and head for the rendezvous point. The *Enterprise* will have to remain here until the endgame with Gul Lemec is played out.

I can't help noticing that Jellico hedges, here, never referencing the accusation, suggesting that he doesn't trust that he actually knows the full scope of Picard's mission.

 > **PICARD**: I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitian civilization are said to be magnificent.

Notice that Picard falls for this pretty much completely.  They've arrested and interrogated him, but sure, let's maybe they want to bond over a shared love of archaeology.

 > **PICARD**: That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives. It depleted your food supplies, left your population weakened and miserable and yet you risk another war.

This seems like a *really* interesting data point.  "Hundreds of thousands of lives" lost puts the war between the Federation and the Cardassians on the same level as the (different) wars for Mexican and Turkish Independence (among others) or, more recently, the United States war in (separately) Afghanistan and Iraq.  In other words, two interstellar, colonial powers consider it a devastating war for what, today, would look more like a regional conflict.

In turn, if that depleted their food system---let's ignore that they keep reminding us that everybody's food gets dumped out of a replicator---it may suggest that the Cardassians already had serious supply line problems.  And that calls into question how they characterized the war in [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}), suggesting that the Federation had a tough time of it.

Also, he puts all the blame on the Cardassians, including for their economic failure.

 > **PICARD**: Torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the Seldonis Four convention governing treatment of prisoners of war.

This...might actually confirm that Picard's team killed a few dozen people, because identifying as a [prisoner of war](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prisoner_of_war) requires an ongoing or resolving armed conflict, but they've repeatedly made the point since introducing the Cardassians that the war has completely ended.

Lemec will shortly make a related point that the Federation would need to admit to authorizing the treaty-violating mission.  And that recalls *The Wounded*, again, in how the Federation wanted to take care in the diplomatic conflict, but only because they didn't think that they'd win a war.

 > **RIKER**: Aye, sir. Request permission to begin planning a rescue operation.
 >
 > **JELLICO**: I know you were close to him, Will, but we don't even know if he's still alive. Under the circumstances, a rescue mission would be foolhardy.

Also, it'd almost certainly qualify as an act of war.  Regardless of what Picard did on his mission, crossing the border to break him out of a hypothetical holding pen almost certainly violates a bunch of treaties, or at least their sovereignty.  But I notice that they don't seem to care about that.

 > **MADRED**: Yes, but human mothers and fathers don't love their children as we do. They're not the same as we are.

Notice that this echoes the crew's repeated line, starting in [*When the Bough Breaks*]({% post_url 2022-09-08-bough-breaks %}), that humans have much more attachment to their children than anybody else.

 > **PICARD**: Since the military took over hundreds of thousands more have died.

Has the military only conducted the one war, then?  It seems to me that Picard cited the same approximation for a single war that they now agree improved the Cardassian economy.

 > **PICARD**: Her belly may be full, but her spirit will be empty.

Madred already called him arrogant for me, but seriously, what business does he have telling an alien culture how they should conduct their entire lives, and how they should weigh biological necessities against abstractions?

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain, what if you're wrong? What if the Cardassians are in that nebula to conduct scientific research?

Have they ever challenged Picard on these terms?  Does their dislike of Jellico make them nicer to everyone else...?

 > **PICARD**: Torture has never been a reliable means of extracting information. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. One wonders that it's still practiced.

Much as I find it weird to agree with Picard, this bears out.  Torture in interrogations only encourages the victim to tell the interrogator whatever they want to hear, regardless of its validity.

I do find it interesting that he also says that it doesn't work to control people (also true), given that he authorized torturing Hugh---rationing "food" based on the kid's cooperation---in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}) in order to force his compliance.

 > **PICARD**: Sur le pont d'Avignon, on y danse...

Picard has apparently decided to go with a spoken-word rendition of [*Sur le Pont d'Avignon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sur_le_Pont_d%27Avignon).  The world has apparently turned upside-down, because not only did I need to agree with Picard about torture, but I've also liked the *song* since a local children's show that I grew up with highlighted it...

 > **LAFORGE**: I could do it, but truthfully, the man you want is Commander Riker. He's the best there is.

When did Riker ever show even the slightest interest in piloting?  Hell, other than jazz, poker, and sexual harassment, when has he shown the slightest interest in *anything*...?

 > **JELLICO**: Let's drop the ranks for a moment. I don't like you. I think you're insubordinate, arrogant, willful, and I don't think you're a particularly good first officer. But you are also the best pilot on the ship.

Thank you, episode...

 > **RIKER**: Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you, either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to control everything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, and you don't inspire these people to go out of their way for you. You've got everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don't think you're a particularly good Captain.

Wouldn't this line land better if we had actually *seen* any of that behavior?  We've seen the crew recoil at his different operational preferences, but Jellico has tried to treat people as individuals---including soliciting Data's opinions, by the way, which almost no outsider has done---at least within the constraints of the mission, asked Troi to dress like an adult, and refused to give Riker resources to go rogue on a personal mission with no plan.  The episode certainly wants us to dislike Jellico, but without evidence of him not supporting people, Riker comes off looking petty, especially demanding *joy* in tense negotiations that could lead to war.

 > **JELLICO**: Excellent. Oh, and one more thing. I understand you're holding a Starfleet officer named Jean-Luc Picard. I expect him returned, immediately.

Apparently, they *all* do the smug shows of dominance over aliens...

 > **PICARD**: No, no, but I was going to. I would have told him anything. Anything at all. But more than that, I believed that I could see five lights.

This---which we knew in the moment, but it becomes unnecessarily explicit, here, for some reason---makes the big, defiant line even more pathetic, because it shows that he literally only defied Madred because he knew that he wouldn't face any consequences, much like Jellico's demand to release him that led to it.

## Conclusions

Generally, we get the aforementioned character moments, plus an interest in preserving centuries-old French songs.

### The Good

Possibly only because they don't like their new manager, the crew seems to have grown more compassionate, resisting attacking people based on the possibility that they might not deserve it.  We also see that at least that new manager can see the unprofessional behavior that we often see on display, too.

They also at least acknowledge the futility of torturing prisoners.

### The Bad

The Federation seems to genuinely want a war with the Cardassians.  While the episode never confirms it, various characters drop strong hints that Picard's side-mission involved killing a significant number of people.  Nobody back on the *Enterprise* seems to think of invading their territory for a jailbreak as warranting concern from the perspective of international relations.

Meanwhile, the Federation also unilaterally blames the Cardassians for all damage done during the previous war, including Cardassian losses.  And they may also greatly exaggerate the size of the war.

We see a rather direct refutation of the idea that humans value children more than other civilizations, by showing Cardassians echoing the same sentiment.

And Federation citizens seem to think that they know how alien cultures should conduct themselves.  Coupled with that, they show that the love of pushing aliens around seems more widespread than only the crew that we see.

## Stay Tuned...

I needed to agonize a bit over the decision, here.  After this episode, **TNG** took 1992 winter holidays and most of January off, during which time we got the first few episodes of **Deep Space Nine** and got to know that cast.  Having watched both shows as they aired and remembering the divergence in tone, I had to weigh whether to cover all of **TNG** including the films before moving to **DS9** against covering them in the order that they aired to use that contrast.  Largely because I didn't look forward to writing multiple season-summary posts in rapid succession and committing to do that for three-and-a-half years of talking about **DS9**, I ultimately opted for the former approach, especially since I already established a precedent by finishing the original series appearances before moving to this series.  As such, we'll stick with this crew for another year or so, while they meet the occasional character from the other show before we do.

As such, come back in a week, when we ask whatever happened to the Moriarty hologram, in *Ship in a Bottle*.
