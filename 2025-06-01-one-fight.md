As somewhere between a preview for tomorrow's developer diary post and an explanation for how this post pulled itself into existence, we'll start observing [International Sex Workers' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whores%27_Day) in eighteen hours or so depending on when this goes out, ignoring the older name of the holiday that we surely should've always found offensive.  Anyway, I started writing a paragraph that looked a lot like this one, getting into the sketchiest overview of the history, indicating---as you'll see---that the events kicked off the modern movement to protect the rights of sex workers.

![A demonstration, with participants wearing domino masks, urging protecting sex workers instead of raiding their spaces](/blog/assets/30448839452_8cdc8e7e61_o.png "Hard to believe that the Backpage raid happened almost a decade ago, at this rate...")

Then, as a half-joke, I typed out a line that amused me, both in the presentation, and in shining the brightest spotlight that I can find on why we don't talk about these issues.

> Yes, a question from the back of the room.  Why would I care when I don't pay for sex?  OK, let me pull my soapbox out.

And then I proceeded to "quickly" answer that question.

The first draft of the answer came to five hundred words.  And then I started adding footnotes.  And I started connecting the central issue here with the fact that we have started June and a different observance, and how the two relevant holidays interact, and how these issues have their tendrils everywhere.

The topic apparently demanded its own post, not a half-snarky paragraph to kick off a post that'll center me talking about my practicing stenography and some code changes.  Let's go, then, so that we don't feel like I've minimized this, when I mention the holiday tomorrow and continue on.

## Humanity

I want to get this out of the way, even though it doesn't get any more important.

Therefore, first and bluntly, we should care about the rights of sex workers, because their humanity demands that we treat them with respect.  In most jurisdictions, we have made their work illegal---probably because we typically associate sex work with women, and nothing terrifies society as much as women taking (economic) power from their own exploitation; more on that later---but that doesn't undermine their humanity, it makes their work more laborious and dangerous, where they need their rights protected more.

I feel like I shouldn't need to say this to anybody, but as a species and as a shared culture, we have *never* gone wrong by extending the rights that we recognize to new groups of natural entities.  I mean, sure, we could argue whether treating corporations like people has helped anything but exploitation (it probably hasn't), but acknowledging rights in squishy things with metabolisms has gone pretty well for us, I think.

Human rights versus legality of work seems like an especially interesting argument, given how few people sex workers generally hurt, especially given the tendency of violence *towards* them.  I mean, compare the damage done by sex workers to the damage done by a handful of generative AI companies to [the environment](https://theconversation.com/power-hungry-ai-is-driving-a-surge-in-tech-giant-carbon-emissions-nobody-knows-what-to-do-about-it-233452) and [our intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf), the [economic damage](https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/08/sucker-at-the-table/#clucks-definance) (a euphemism for destroying people's lives) from private equity firms, literally Bill Gates by himself [convincing the West to not share COVID-19 vaccine technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426020143/https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/04/25/share-vaccine-recipes-poor-during-pandemic-one-worlds-richest-men-bill-gates-says-no#)[^1] as required by treaties, or [Elon Musk gutting aid to people in need {% cc %}](https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/usaid-doge-deaths-children-cuts-7nb83dfkp).  They do all that perfectly legally, and nobody (other than the conspiracy theorists who we presumably don't take seriously) would suggest that we shouldn't protect the civil rights of Bill Gates.

[^1]:  Common Dreams still exists and hosts this article, so you know, but at some point since its publication, they revised the license on everything on their site, making it non-commercial distribution only, probably in violation of the license that authors agreed to on publication, so I'd rather not funnel traffic directly to them when a version still exists with the original license.

Do you *seriously* want to tell me that, whether because of some weird obsession with women's virginity leading to outlawing the practice or your romanticized notions---and I don't object to those notions, as long as you limit the focus to your personal collection of private parts---of sex needing to correlate with love, that sex workers deserve fewer rights than billionaires who probably have the blood of millions of humans on their hands?

## After Effects

If the "sex workers, as humans, deserve human rights" argument didn't do it for you, consider this:  Our culture often uses sex workers as the test cases for censorship and other thought-crime style laws.  Most prominent in recent memory, we have [FOSTA-SESTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSTA-SESTA) in the United States, a law that *claimed* to want to stop sex trafficking, something that I imagine we all agree with.  Those of you who don't agree can go read elsewhere, thanks.

Despite its alleged intentions, though, the law had one clear effect.  It drove sex work further underground where enforcing rights becomes more difficult.  Who knew?  Oh, right.  The [Department of Justice warned that would happen](https://www.techdirt.com/2018/02/27/doj-tells-congress-sesta-fosta-will-make-it-more-difficult-to-catch-traffickers-house-votes-it-anyway/).  And in retrospect, we know that [the bill utterly failed](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-385.pdf) in its alleged aims.

It had another, related effect, though.  It made [payment companies and online services skittish](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13634607211023013?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.19) about anything that anybody might interpret as overly sexual.  And again, we knew that this would happen, because it *always* happens when somebody passes laws that draw attention to sex.  From the linked paper.

> For example, even when a platform allows certain activities, if a third-party supplier has different Terms and Conditions, or if they are applied in stricter ways, users are impacted. This was the case in 2014 when PayPal withdrew its service to Patreon because some artist-creators used the crowd-patronage platform for explicit/sexual content (Swords, 2018). It resulted in many users being unable to access existing pledges or accept new ones and it is not the only example over the last few years (Stryker, 2014).

The idea that coming after sex workers will impact artists who don't sell sex might sound almost mawkish in the abstract, but for example, do you know an artist struggling to find some way of accepting payment for their work, because the big platforms cut them off for violating some prudish rule that you don't even think applies?  If so, then you've seen those effects.  Or, going further back, the hollowing out of the community on Tumblr---once the driver for a lot of Internet culture at the time, arguably why I avoided it---had similar reasons, of worrying about payment processors balking at "pornography" driving artists away, which drove away their fans.  And today, I see multiple people talking about a reactionary shift on Tumblr, starting with [TERFs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TERF), and expanding from there.

## Spillover

Going further, don't think for a moment that right-wing politicians won't look for any opportunity, over the next couple of years, to expand that distaste of sex work to expand the scope to attack more people.  The folks behind [Project 2025 want to outlaw anything it declares pornography](https://stopproject2025comic.org/comic/internet-freedom/), imprison anybody in the supply chain, and close any company that makes it possible.  What do they consider pornography?  The nine hundred pages mostly avoid talking about that, but the "Promise to America" introduction gives a fairly significant hint, page 5, *massive* content advisory for bigotry.

> Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare.  It has no claim to First Amendment protection.  Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women.  Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.  Pornography should be outlawed.  The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned.  Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders.  And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.

Did you catch that?  The political right says that they see pornography "in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization"---by which they seem to mean acknowledging that they have gender, and/or somebody might admit that they have had the wrong one assigned at birth---of children.  They call the existence of transgender folks in media "as psychologically destructive as any crime," and then suggest shutting down any path ever used to do it, and arresting and stigmatizing anybody who doesn't act against it.

Happy Pride Month, right?  However, you'll notice that they accidentally admit that people want better representation in media, declaring depictions of transgender folks "as addictive as any illicit drug."  And yeah, once you see that the world doesn't end because a show casts a transgender woman or whoever, we start thinking that maybe we should do that more often...

If you cared about my little introduction at the top, seeing the crosshairs drift from sex workers themselves to gender and sexual minorities led me to spin this off into its own post as I tried to explain that "sex workers" doesn't only *mean* sex workers.

And keep in mind that this has already begun in earnest.  Not long ago, we had a Supreme Court justice misreading the presence of a fictional drag queen in a leather jacket from a picture book as [bondage play](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2024/24-297_p8k0.pdf#:~:text=leather%20and) for children.

> **Justice Gorsuch**:  That's the one where they are supposed to look for the leather and things --- and bondage, things like that, right?
>
> **Mr. Schoenfeld**:  It's not bondage.
>
> **Justice Gorsuch**:  A sex ---
>
> **Mr. Schoenfeld**:  It's a woman in a leather ---
>
> **Justice Gorsuch**:  --- sex worker, right?
>
> ...
>
> **Mr. Schoenfeld**:  That's not correct, no.
>
> **Justice Gorsuch**:  I thought --- I thought --- gosh, I --- I read it.
>
> **Justice Barrett**:  It's a drag queen in drag.

At least eleven percent of the Supreme Court of the United States, then, read (or pretended to read) a thirty-two-page picture book using a Pride parade (and presence of the dog) as a pretext to teach the alphabet, and misconstrued a cartoon caricature of a drag queen in a leather jacket as a BDSM sex worker.  And I take a certain amount of glee that the justice who everybody decried as too extreme---because she applies her belief of (human) life starting at conception to companies as well as uteri, remember, instead of giving a pass to any discarding of embryos by a corporation, not that I agree with her on much---gets to describe the error to him.

Meanwhile, Congress began the process last month of [banning as much as possible](https://www.lee.senate.gov/2025/5/lee-bill-establishes-obscenity-definition-across-states), a couple of weeks ago, pushing readers to "exclusive coverage" by the right-wing [Daily Caller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Caller) website.  How would Utah's Mike Lee define pornography?

> (i) taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;
>
> (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or lewd exhibition of the genitals, with the objective intent to arouse, titillate, or gratify the sexual desires of a person; and
>
> (iii) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

Now, you or I might believe that the presence of transgender people has artistic, political, and scientific value, because it *does*, especially in the face of these threats.  But remember, Project 2025 and Neil Gorsuch outright told us how they want to play this game, that they connect the bare act of acknowledging the presence of transgender folks and drag queens to an attempt to titillate children, and that it has no value to them.

And by the way, don't forget that---again, in the United States---we still have the so-called [Kids Online Safety Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Online_Safety_Act) lurking in Congress, a bill that takes the same shape as SESTA and FOSTA, allowing authorities to demand taking down of online content that they see as "harmful" to children.  And what do they mean by harm?  Co-author [Marsha Blackburn said outright](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/senator-appears-suggest-bipartisan-bill-will-censor-transgender-conten-rcna103479) that she saw the bill as "protecting minor children from the transgender in this culture," the grammatical error telling us almost as much about her thinking as the statement itself.  And the [Heritage Foundation's opposed the bill {% cc %}](https://web.archive.org/web/20230727231011/https://www.heritage.org/technology/commentary/how-not-keep-children-safe-online), because it didn't make the transphobic angle explicit enough, stating outright that they want an outright ban on minors having the ability to learn about transitioning online.

## Since They Already Need to File Paperwork

Speaking of children's books, we should also talk about Republican-led efforts to [ban books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_commonly_challenged_books_in_the_United_States).  If you sort the list on the Wikipedia page by number of bans 2010--2019, the latest, you'll notice how many books offend people for no other reason than the absurdly vague "LGBT content" or "LGBT themes," which means pretty much anything.  Digging deeper, you might also notice that many of the complaints about "sexual content" (or variations) go to autobiographies of authors of color describing traumatic events.

That process definitely didn't stop where the table runs out of data.  Quite the contrary, since 2021, we've seen [thousands of demands to censor books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_banning_in_the_United_States_%282021%E2%80%93present%29), by groups that "aim to disrupt lessons on race and gender," while "alleging discrimination against white students."

Oh, and don't forget the executive order in March, [condemning the Smithsonian Institution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/), "seeking to remove improper ideology from" the museums, research/education centers, and the zoo.  What does Trump mean by that?

> For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features “The Shape of Power:  Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit representing that “[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.”  The exhibit further claims that “sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism” and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating “Race is a human invention.”

Yep.  It makes him sad that people might learn that the United States---the country that invented the idea of treating slaves as a permanent underclass to manage like livestock, then spent another full century maintaining that underclass after we fought an entire war to end slavery, not to mention the brutal early versions of Border Patrols---has disenfranchised people of certain races or that Europeans made up race to justify "discovering," conquering, and colonizing other people's land.  And it indicates what he thinks of as proper ideology[^2].

[^2]:  If I didn't find the condemnation of Republican hypocrisy a waste of time, because you won't find anybody who doesn't already know and cares deeply, I might point out that Republicans spent decades railing against [political correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) (by which they meant speaking about people respectfully), and have embraced an almost precise synonym.  But I do, so I won't.

In other words, especially if they have pigmented skin, then they also urge us to erase the lives of people from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially if they dare to mention that they didn't have an easy life.  Your existence, apparently, discriminates against people like me, I guess because I didn't have the same opportunities to get assaulted as a child?

## And So On

While we have to head down this road of the right-wing trying to censor and erase groups that they don't like, let's not forget the Junior Generalissimo to call [professors and universities "the enemy," quoting Richard Nixon](https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2024/09/09/jd-vance-says-aggressively-attack-the-universities-in-this-country-promotes-my-new-book/), not from some famous speech, but from secret recordings immediately after he won re-election in 1972.

Trump himself keeps [attacking major universities](https://theconversation.com/harvard-fights-to-keep-enrolling-international-students-4-essential-reads-about-their-broader-impact-257506) for "violating" his preferences on the above issues, not to mention going on about [prosecuting his political enemies {% cc by-nc-nd %}](https://truthout.org/articles/trump-threatens-media-opponents-with-legal-action-in-doj-speech/) for similar reasons.

Many of us probably qualify as Trump's political enemies already.  Over in [my archived tweets](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/), you'll find more than one instance where I replied to Spineless Leader (and Apartheid Clyde) telling them what I thought of their ideas, so even I probably have an FBI file, even with as little power as I have.  But who else might have *become* a political enemy, since Trump's inauguration?

Well, Republican voters have started to realize that [tariffs hurt them](https://theconversation.com/trumps-job-cuts-are-causing-republican-angst-as-all-parties-face-backlash-252940) more than anybody else.  Likewise, [gutting the bureaucracy](https://therealnews.com/hands-off-trump-doge-backlash-packs-dc) crushes them more than most of the country.  Over in the land where some people need medication to survive, [Trump replaced Biden's plan with a toothless wish list](https://cepr.net/publications/cheap-drugs-for-all/), while his favorite bear-corpse enthusiast released a somehow-non-satirical [report blaming your eating habits, screen-time, and prescription drug use](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf "seventy-three (73) pages if that AI-generated garbage") for your health problems while soft-pedaling on chemical contamination and actual disease, which connects directly with the attacks on (now) [foreign students at major universities](https://theconversation.com/harvard-fights-to-keep-enrolling-international-students-4-essential-reads-about-their-broader-impact-257506), because they do a lot of the research that enables the creation of safe and effective prescription drugs.  Let's not even get started on the [rifts forming around the One Big Beautiful Bill](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/5/24/2323893/-Conservatives-are-suddenly-not-so-sure-about-House-GOP-s-tax-bill) that'll add trillions to the debt while we have high interest rates, while cutting programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which---once again---Republican voters disproportionately need.  Even the conspiracy theorist wing now [questions Trump's commitment to releasing the files on Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hyped-release-epstein-files-sparks-anger-disappointment-right-rcna194087) after a blatant half-measure by he and his cronies.

No doubt, many Republican voters will continue to move the goal posts so that Trump can do no wrong, because at least we didn't elect the woman with brown skin who talked about solving problems.  But some of them have become vocal in their criticism, which might make them political enemies, too.  We see time after time, after all, that these people get so little accomplished because their [whiny in-fighting {% cc by-nc-sa %}](https://boingboing.net/2025/05/30/musk-shoved-scott-bessent-in-angry-fight-white-house-confirms.html) inevitably wrecks their coalitions.

## Underlying Drivers

I should mention---as I surely have before---that a lot of these bigotries have a common root:  Misogyny.

Why does society have such a problem with sex work?  When we shifted from living as communal nomads to living in households in agricultural communities, men turned around and decided that they couldn't imagine any worse fate than maybe one day accidentally raising a child not directly related to them, even though they could only guess how to identify such a situation at the time.  And they couldn't think of a better way of preventing that than controlling women, limiting how they can pass through society, lest their ambulatory wombs, suddenly deprived of identity, might incubate and deliver somebody else's baby.  This gets to the bizarre obsession with virginity, which doesn't actually have any biological meaning, and so any "test" will get it wrong a lot of the time.

From this core atrocity, you can directly see the hatred of sex workers form.  We tend to associate sex work with women, and they represent liberation from that inane idea that we need to monitor and control women's sexuality.  If word gets out that women could have sex with whoever they please for whatever reasons they like, who *knows* what could happen...?  Likewise, I assume that everybody sees the direct connection to identical opposition to abortion.

Misogyny also feeds homophobia and transphobia.  After all, when you have an entire part of culture dedicated to controlling the sexuality of women, how does that pan out when you have people who don't conform to that gender binary?  What happens when you (a misogynist man) suddenly now needs to account for women who have no interest in your control or give you any justification?  Will a gay man treat you the same way that you treat women?  And how do you even *identify* a transgender person?  They solve that problem with hatred and control, big surprise.

Racism, likewise, stems from this same worry.  White folks *invented* race to justify conquering, occupying, and enslaving other people's countries, but they sustained those actions by screaming that "those people" would "take our women."  When those "fun" activities started to lose currency, societies passed anti-miscegenation laws, often as not enforced extra-judicially, also with a eugenicist panic about [white genocide myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory), most of which center on miscegenation.  When I mentioned the brutality of the early United States Border Control, this drove them, an abject terror of Chinese and Mexican folks sneaking in and seducing white women.  We have stereotypes about the sexuality of various ethnicities, warning women away from these men because they don't do it well, or those because they get too intense.

And it drives the rest of toxic masculinity, too.  Why do men have more dangerous jobs?  Well, we drove women out of those fields for the aforementioned reasons.  Why do we insist that men shoulder most of the burden of financially supporting their families and looking suspiciously at any man who voluntarily spends time with children?  Well, we insisted that women manage the household, and we can't have somebody illustrate the artificial nature of that.  Everything revolves around domination, because a crack in the hierarchy exposes that we don't have "biological imperatives" to treat each other like garbage, and can walk away at any time, singly or in unison, and get far better results[^3].  This horrible vision of masculinity exploded into the biggest [pyramid scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme) in history, because not only do we all need to follow the rules and *believe* in them, but we also need to become the recruiters and enforcers to participate, at least judging people who don't conform if not actively participating in brutality against them.

[^3]:  Opposition to feminism thrives in this space, by the way.  By ignoring underlying cause of misogyny, misogynists get to recruit with specifically these sorts of problems, but blame feminists.  By agitating for policies that take more power from women or amplify toxicity, they make their own lives worse, which (a) lets them brew up new conspiracy theories about how those diabolical feminists have taken a stronger hold and (b) brings in the next batch of recruits, who might have looked at the crackpot plans more skeptically before things got worse.

Policies follow these channels to hurt everybody, because the extrapolation of misogyny has built the infrastructure to enable that spread.

## The Point

I realize that this seemed like a twisting path, but I did that to make the point that we really only have one fight, here.  At the signing of the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence), we claim that Benjamin Franklin said the following.

> We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.

Either Franklin didn't actually say it, or he borrowed it from an April 1776 letter from [Carter Braxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Braxton) or wherever *he* borrowed it from.

Regardless of its origin, it holds significant meaning for us.  When we fight back against one of these attacks, we fight back against all of them.  And when we opt to [sacrifice one of these fights {% cc %}](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/03/newsom-transgender-athletes/) in hopes of not offending "undecided voters," we actually give up on all the fights, by both gutting alliances and giving the aggressors more confidence and authority.

In other words, we should care about sex workers---remember *them*, back at the top of the post?---both because we recognize them as fellow humans who deserve the same rights to safety and health as the rest of us no matter what you think about their careers, and also because we care about somebody else "downstream" of the attacks against them.  The people who demean sex workers often associate them intrinsically with gender and sexual minorities[^4], who they use as test cases for policies against racialized groups---sometimes laundering them through prisons, first---and then roll out to the rest of us.  Even if you don't care about anybody else in the world, you still live at the bottom of the mountain with the avalanche in progress...

[^4]:  In looking for a header image for this post, I saw one banner at a protest declaring "Sex workers are part of the LGBTQ+ community," presumably exactly for the reason that an attack on one inevitably becomes an attack on the other.

And there you go, the offhand comment that I almost made in tomorrow's post.  Now go figure out how to agitate for sex workers' rights...
