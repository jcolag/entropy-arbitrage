This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) watches **The Man Behind the Machine**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Man Behind the Machine

The film's blurb reads as follows.

 > X33, an Artificial Life machine, battles with its own mortality and individuality after a new Government ruling.
 >
 > Winner of: ★ Best First Time Filmmaker (short film) at Cannes World Film Festival ★ Best Sci Fi Short Film at Touchstone Independent Film Festival ★ Best Sound Design at Touchstone Independent Film Festival ★ Best Exploration of Human-Machine Discomfort at Burano Artificial Intelligence Film Festival
 >
 > A debut short film written and directed by Dalano Barnes, featuring Kamran Vahabi as X33 and Robert Firth (Guardians of the Galaxy, Snowden) as Martin Bradshaw, the machine's owner.
 >
 > The cast includes Lydia Helen (Channel 4's Humans), William Bassoumba, Hattie Hillard and Kane O'Brien.
 >
 > With an original soundtrack composed by Nathan Meneghini and a dystopian sound design by Kane O'Brien.
 >
 > This is Dalano Barnes' debut short film, responsible for producing, writing, directing and editing of the film. The budget for this film was entirely raised through Kickstarter, and saw an independent cinema release that sold over 110 tickets across 3 screenings. 

I don't have more than that, other than to congratulate them on the awards.

## What Works Well?

Especially given that this provides us with, primarily, one person's vision---Burke produced, wrote, directed, and edited---this seems extremely impressive.  Everything feels snappy and slick, even when it might lack a certain amount of clarity.  And I don't want to put the responsibility for that on a single person, because the cast also works well with each other and the overall setting.

And speaking of the setting, even though it definitely has more than a few aspects that we've all seen before, it comes together feeling fresh.  Maybe that comes from the "thriller" aspect of the story, or maybe it has enough original touches that it gives the sense of breaking new ground, but something does help.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I don't know that the rapid flashbacks serve the story well.  They distract a bit, especially given the frequency, and they don't often add anything to the "main" part of the story.  And given the perspective shifts, the film never really makes it clear *who* remembers this, though the context definitely suggests a specific character.

## Opportunities

The aforementioned blurb includes the following links.

I haven't looked at any of the social media, though.

## What's Adaptable?

We see the Turing Corporation and their Artificial Life units, plus a Juggling Mania event in late September.

Note, by the way, that I didn't see any reference to a Creative Commons license in the film's credits or anywhere in the [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dalano/the-man-behind-the-machine/description), so you might want to tread lightly, here.  Burke definitely [released the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2wb3-iuRk) on his YouTube channel under the specified license and hasn't changed it in the twenty or so months since the release.  But if he didn't *intend* to do it, then I imagine that might cause problems.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll start reading **Cairn**, a role-playing game.  It runs a bit long, so we'll split it across three weeks, starting with the (second edition) Players Guide and backgrounds, followed by two weeks trying to split the Wardens Guide as evenly as possible.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the film?
