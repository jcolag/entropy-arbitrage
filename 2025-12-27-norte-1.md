To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Norte

The book's page provides the following synopsis.

> No espaço entre Buenos Aires, os desertos de Catamarca e a Patagônia aos pés da cordilheira andina, Téo Miranda está deslocado de seu território habitual. Acostumado a investigar adultérios na São Paulo urbana, o detetive particular descobre-se em paragens remotas, contra o vento e a poeira, na busca por um tio desaparecido há mais de trinta anos.
>
> Marcada por curvas imprevistas e a aridez da Ruta Nacional 40, a investigação se torna ainda mais difícil pela companhia insistente de Gustavo, com quem Téo mantém um relacionamento incerto. O detetive logo se dá conta de que para encontrar o tio precisa compreender seus motivos, mas a tarefa o obrigará a enfrentar suas próprias inseguranças --- ou correr o risco de se perder nesse eterno meio de caminho no rumo do fin del mundo.

Or, for those like myself who don't read Portuguese, that translates to this.

> In the space between Buenos Aires, the deserts of Catamarca, and Patagonia, at the foot of the Andean mountain range, Téo Miranda finds himself displaced from his usual area. Used to investigating adultery in urban São Paulo, the private detective finds himself in remote locations, against wind and dust, searching for an uncle who disappeared more than thirty years ago.
>
> Marked by unforeseen turns and the aridity of the National Route 40, the investigation becomes even more difficult by Gustavo's insistent company, with whom Téo maintains an uncertain relationship. The detective soon realizes that to find his uncle, he needs to understand his motives, but the task will force him to face his own insecurities --- or risk getting lost in this eternal middle ground on the way to the end of the world.

As you can guess from the blurb, I'll read this in shoddy machine translation, so may miss some nuances.  Also, based on the crowdfunding campaign, it looks like that version printed to 180 pages, suggesting that we probably don't have the full book in the repository, similarly meaning that I might not spot something critical.

## What Works Well?

I have to admit that the first chapter---despite the unnecessary dry exposition and through the translation---managed to draw me in, both with the "teaser sequence" of the lost child, and in the loving description of the scene.  Part of that probably comes from the asides sprinkled through Téo's narration.

The relationships also *might* feel more real than any of the other stories that we've looked at in these posts, astonishing given that it happened (so far) in only about five thousand words.  It doesn't take much to see the affections and stresses in Téo's marriage to Gustavo, and to a lesser extent---she doesn't get nearly as much attention---the friendship and business relationship between Téo and Elisa.

Also, despite the translation making a mess of the prose, the protagonist's sense of humor comes shining through.

> He knew that there was no way to get lost; it was enough to find San Martín Avenue
>
> (It's always a San Martín Avenue)

I suspect that everywhere has something *similar to* the idea, aspects of almost every town in the area that you can use as a landmark without knowing anything about it.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

This feels like a reach, especially since the author may have done it intentionally for some effect that we'll discover next week---or that maybe the text already revealed, and I missed it in the translation, for that matter---but it often feels like the book jumps around without a plan.  We start out well, moving from introducing the situation to setting up the road trip to actually seeing the early stages of the road trip.  However, we then jump to a maybe-unrelated event where Téo plans for a flight, shortly after meeting Gustavo.  And then Gustavo has gone to visit some of Téo's family and no longer seems relevant, while Téo wanders back to the main plot...probably.

## Opportunities

The Codeberg repository exists, though it hasn't seen any activity since the crowdfunding campaign.  I imagine that, especially since the campaign beat the target by eighty percent, you can probably buy the book somewhere.

## What's Adaptable?

I didn't see anything named.  Or rather, the story introduced me to [Juan José Saer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Saer)'s work, but he and **La pesquisa** actually exist.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up reading **Norte**, from *3* to the end.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
