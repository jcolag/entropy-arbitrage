This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading the *Aether Galaxy*, finishing the **Foundational Guide**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *Aether Galaxy*
 * Location:  <https://github.com/tfclarkdesigns/Aether-Galaxy>, <https://tfclarkdesigns.github.io/Aether-Galaxy/>
 * Released:  2025 --
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Terrance Clark
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately seventeen thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook

The repository describes itself as follows.

> Mythic space-opera setting released under CC BY 4.0. An open galaxy for writers, artists, GMs, and world-builders. "No canon, only coherence."
>
> ...
>
> Aether Galaxy takes place ages ago, in a far-distant galaxy of many advanced species. Civilization is shaped by two Great Powers—and by the ancient Orders that stand beside them.
>
> ...
>
> Nine thousand years have passed since the Commonwealth’s founding. The balance of the galaxy stands upon the edge of a blade. Without heroes, there can be no hope.

And now, other than that I discovered it because the creator occasionally posts to Mastodon under reasonable tags, you know pretty much what I do about the project.

## What Works Well?

I might argue that *Appendix B* (Creator's Toolkit) does some of the most important work, stretching even beyond the specific project.  It goes through the licensing and attribution information, a style guide, and at least the start of recommendations for expansion.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The planets often seem somewhat loosely sketched, despite a clear intent to use many of them as adventure seeds.  It seems especially thin given that the list takes up a substantial part of this half of the book.

Most prominently, the framing of *Appendix A* (Relevant Public Domain Technology) makes me uncomfortable.  To use its own explanation, the terms:

> ...represent genre-relevant concepts that are in the public domain and may be freely referenced, adapted, or expanded upon within the **Aether Galaxy** setting.

Unfortunately terminology doesn't really work that way.  Nobody can secure copyright for a word, so ideas such as the public domain don't apply.  By contrast, people and organizations can secure words as *trademarks*, but you don't have an affirmative public domain in that sense from prior art.  In that way, the list gets it wrong on both counts:  Anybody can refer to a "warp core," even if a major franchise uses it prominently.  But if they use it so often that it becomes associated with them (or if they register the term as a trademark), then you shouldn't use it as part of a competing product's identity.

That said, I only really see a problem with the *framing*, here, that somebody has found "acceptable words."  Having a "glossary" of the in-universe jargon actually makes plenty of sense.

And as a final, small issue, buried at the end, the book's credits *might* indicate where many of the other problems that I have noted come from:  "with editorial and research assistance from ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI)."  It does note that "Every section was planned, reviewed, and rewritten by the human author," but since language models don't care, it goes a long way to explaining why the book doesn't seem to know whether it has two governments or one, believes that the genre has proprietary terminology, and so forth.

## Opportunities

The GitHub repository has seemed highly active since October, though with only one contributor so far.

## What's Adaptable?

The Gazetteer does most of the heavy lifting, here, with six regions of space hosting twenty named planets of importance to the fictional universe.

## Coming Attractions

Next up, we'll wrap up the material for the *Aether Galaxy* setting, at least the material currently available, with everything beyond the **Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook**, a couple of short references and starts of stories.

{% include fchelp.md %}

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the reference material?
