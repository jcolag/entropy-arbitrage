As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Research shows that people gain a sense of connection by experiencing positive emotions together. And this sense of connection is not only in your mind.

We all know that you can't socialize based on a formula, I assume, but these details might help a few people.

 > ...reduced food insecurity in the mothers' family environments, and lessened the mothers' depression, alcohol, and drug problems, and their use of corporal punishment.

It amazes me how often we see research that shows and confirms that supporting parents reduces future problems.  Everybody who opposes such support needs to explain why the feel comfortable propagating those problems.

 > Corporate pay practices are still based on the ridiculous notion that the "genius" in the corner office is almost single-handedly responsible for company value.

As usual, I don't have much interest in supporting "we need to do this thing that we have no power to do," because it just gives people an excuse to feel powerless or, worse, turn on the politicians who largely agree with them for "not doing anything."  However, with those caveats, I'd call this discussion fairly well done.

Doctorow links to and quotes from a few other articles that I found well worth reading.  Honestly, I almost linked to one or two of those, but then decided to go with the summary, instead.

While granting that we really shouldn't encourage people to travel with likely two pandemics that we "can't" fix...without mildly damaging corporate profits, we still need more facilities like these.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A brief history of Esperanto, the 135-year-old language of peace hated by Hitler and Stalin alike](https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-esperanto-the-135-year-old-language-of-peace-hated-by-hitler-and-stalin-alike-186025) from The Conversation.

 > Unfortunately, conflicts over language are common around the world.

I still need to put some effort into learning Esperanto.  I took an initial few stabs at reading it, and felt so successful---many words have similar roots to languages that I already know---that it mostly fell away.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Navajo Code Talker Samuel Sandoval Dies; 3 Code Talkers Remain](https://www.voanews.com/a/navajo-code-talker-samuel-sandoval-dies-3-code-talkers-remain-/6680831.html) from Voice of America

 > Hundreds of Navajos were recruited from the vast Navajo Nation to serve as Code Talkers with the U.S. Marine Corps. Only three are still alive today: Peter MacDonald, John Kinsel Sr. and Thomas H. Begay.

It occurs to me that Sandoval might represent the first *name* of a Navajo Code Talker that I've heard.  Like everyone else, I've heard of the *program*---a military project to use a Native American language as an extra layer of "encryption" to communications during World War II---but always in the abstract, as if the people doing the work didn't matter.  That disappoints me in a few ways.
