Incidentally, happy [Armistice Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day)---[Veterans Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day) in the United States and [Remembrance Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day) in former British territories---where depending on your circle, either celebrates peace or military service.

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1589619429586833410) [Why there really is no ethical reason not to vote](https://theconversation.com/why-there-really-is-no-ethical-reason-not-to-vote-193612) from The Conversation

 > But an uninformed voter can fix that problem and remove the ethical dilemma --- and with minimal time and effort.

I doubt that anyone who refused to vote would bother to read this article---certainly, when I didn't vote, I insisted that I had it right and everybody else got it wrong, without bothering to identify where I disagreed with the argument---but I assume that people who have non-voters in their lives can make better use of the article for future elections.

 > Anti-abortion groups have made voter suppression their rallying cry because between two-thirds and three-quarters of all US citizens support the right to abortion.

All this work, and sacrificing almost every principle of their religion, for nothing more than to disempower women...

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1590343702077128706) [GitHub Users File a Class-Action Lawsuit Against Microsoft for Training an AI Tool With Their Code](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm3k5/github-users-file-a-class-action-lawsuit-against-microsoft-for-training-an-ai-tool-with-their-code) from VICE Motherboard

 > Other programmers who have been using Copilot have noted that it generated the incorrect license for code and produced users' copyrighted code verbatim without proper attribution or license.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I opted not to get directly involved in the lawsuit, since I believe that any training-based use of my code---barely, and only barely---falls under Fair Use doctrine.  However, I did have a brief discussion with organizers about my [experiments with Copilot]({% post_url 2021-11-03-copilot2 %}) from about a year ago, including the point that reproducing the text of licenses shows that it violates those licenses, by not imposing proper terms on users.

 > The judge who granted the search warrant, Mary Shaw, was chosen by Joshua Jaynes, one of the detectives accused of falsifying an affidavit, because he believed she would "not look too closely at the application."

If you've read around here for long, then you know that I don't love these "Democrats need to be more like *me*" think-pieces, when those people refuse to work for the party.  I wrote an [entire post about why political parties don't reflect people]({% post_url 2020-08-30-parties %}); a party can't represent you, if you don't participate in it.  However, this does work well as an overview of the good happening, and what other *activists* should learn from.

 > This PM2.5 category of particulate matter is known from previous research to significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and even ocular diseases.

I've heard a lot of people, recently, complaining about these sorts of problems.  It might be worth it for people to start investing in air purifiers...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why schools' going back to â€˜normal' won't work for students of color](https://theconversation.com/why-schools-going-back-to-normal-wont-work-for-students-of-color-192228) from The Conversation

 > Children's books depict nonhuman characters, like dogs and bears, almost three times as often as they depict characters who are Black, four times as often than Asian characters, five times as often than Hispanic characters, and nearly 30 times as often than Indigenous characters.

It consistently frustrates me that people still have the nerve to talk about "getting back to normal," as if "normal" worked for everybody.  We had such a great opportunity to make lasting change for the better, and scrapped it, because media people wouldn't shut up about wanting to hug people.
