While I don't generally indulge religious holidays---except for Christmas, which [stitches together so many solstice traditions]({% post_url 2019-12-24-christmas %}) that it functions secularly, no matter how many weirdo Christians think that they have [a war to win]({% post_url 2021-12-05-war %})---the [Epiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_%28holiday%29) more or less wraps up the Christmas season that arguably started about a month ago, and has loosely adapted traditions such as [Koliada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koliada) much as Christmas adapts traditions from so many other holidays.

On that brief note, on to the projects.

## Scheduling Note

I'll bring it up as we get closer, but at some point soon, I plan to change servers.  While Linode has mostly served me well, Akamai purchasing them a while back has bothered me, since I don't need more huge companies in my life, especially since they announced the acquisition with a price increase and no visible improvements since.  Plus, we now have a generation of cheaper VPS services, meaning that I no longer need to throw a couple-hundred bucks per month at hosting a static blog and an occasional application, a lot like signing up for Linode however many years ago meant that I didn't need to rent a physical server at a much higher price than that.

Again, I'll issue reminders when the plan solidifies, but due to DNS propagation, moving things over slowly, and possibly my forgetfulness, you might see occasional outages of the site.  If you can't get through to something, please give it a few minutes and try again.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

As I put it in [last week's post]({% post_url 2024-12-30-rizal %}), not much actually happened, here, so don't expect anything exciting.

Partly to not leave another task completely hanging, but also to stay on "lighter duty" work for the week, I continued reformatting the code for consistency.  Eventually, this will drift into refactoring the worst of the code---a lot of this project "evolved organically," code for slop that I wrote as I needed it without a plan---but that'll need to wait until I have the fortitude to push through the code.

## Next

I'd like to move onto better projects, including revisiting some items that I've forgotten about.  But continuing to clean up the **Morning Dashboard** code might prove irresistible.
