As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

If you haven't noticed, most of Trump's "big" moves involve avenues for people to bribe him.  This has no camouflage on it, similar to when he extorted law firms to donate pro bono work to his hand-picked causes.  But the politics of tariffs revolve entirely around carving out exceptions for allies.  His obsession with personal loyalty and isolating himself from the media goes to reduce the chances of anybody catching him.  Even the obsession with stopping immigration goes to forcing Americans into low-paying laborer jobs.

 > And this supports our core theory going into the study: Terrorist groups act strategically, balancing the benefits of exploiting a crisis against the potential reputational fallout.

I feel like this holds a lesson for a lot of us.  When you want to change minds, you need to balance how it affects the reputation of people in power and your own reputation.

Mind you, Republicans see those real-world costs as the *benefits* to cutting the program, because education and a middle class doesn't work for making the rich richer...

Authoritarians love to describe themselves as "strongmen," and yet, they can't deal with the tiniest bit of criticism.  An objective observer might get the impression that they don't actually have much strength at all...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
