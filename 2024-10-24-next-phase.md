## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *star-trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Next Phase

While I actually enjoy a lot about this episode (no way, John likes an episode where Michelle Forbes has a lot to do?), we'll probably breeze through a lot of it, since it focuses almost entirely on its plot.  We'll get orders of magnitude more fake science than anything approaching social commentary.

 > **PICARD**: Repeat your last transmission.

*We* heard him.  I don't know why Picard didn't hear him...

 > **RIKER**: I beg your pardon, Ensign. I didn't quite catch that.

We *get* it, Riker has a problem with Ro.

 > **VAREL**: They are offline.

You might recognize Varel as [Susanna Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Thompson), who we'll see again in about six months, then somewhere during the **DS9** run as Dax's ex for one of television's first same-sex kisses, and a recurring role as the Borg Queen on **Voyager**.  More recently and prominently, she also had regular/recurring roles as Moira Queen on [**Arrow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_%28TV_series%29) and as Carol Preston on [**Timeless**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeless_%28TV_series%29), among a bunch of other roles over the last thirty-plus years.

 > **RIKER**: Geordi, you and Ro.

Huh.  I mentioned in [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}) how strange and maybe telling it seemed that Locarno referred to everyone on his team by their given names *except* for the Bajoran, and we see Geordi make the same awkward move here, presumably to make a point, since Riker can't seem to do anything else.

 > **PICARD**: Ensign, lay in a course away from the Romulan vessel. Engage at warp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode.

Ah, yes, the core of every humanitarian rescue mission:  Looking for excuses to run away and abandon more of the crew to die.

No, really, if they see the Romulan situation as *that* dire, why not evacuate them and destroy the ship?

 > **RO**: Doctor. Doctor Crusher. Doctor Crusher, I'm right here. Damn it.

I appreciate that this episode has the restraint to never try to explain to us how she and La Forge can't touch anything but don't fall through the floor.  We could probably brainstorm a dozen or so ideas about the artificial gravity, but critically, it has nothing to do with the plot.

More importantly, though, I feel like this episode strongly gestures at the lack of casual physical contact that I think that I've mentioned before.  This far in feels like a bizarre point for somebody to notice that they can't touch anything or anybody.

 > **DATA**: Captain? I have a personal favor to ask. I considered Commander La Forge to be my best friend. I believe it is my responsibility to plan and conduct the memorial service. May I have your permission to do so?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Permission granted. Make whatever arrangements you think are appropriate.

Contrast this with how Picard has treated grieving in episodes like [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %}) and probably other episodes that I've forgotten, where he assures everybody that you save grief for later, when nobody has anything else to do.  Here, he still comes off as extremely dismissive, but at least allows it to go forward, at least for the person who will claim to not feel any grief.

 > **WORF**: Commander, the...the Romulans want a computer. We cannot give them access to Federation technology. That is an unacceptable security risk.
 >
 > **RIKER**: What about a computer core from thirty or forty years ago? One the Romulans are already familiar with.

We can't have an episode featuring Romulans that doesn't also feature our protagonists acting as petty as they possibly can.

I mean, if their technology works anything like ours, then the difference in computers decades apart comes more from the manufacturing techniques than capabilities.  If you handed today's top-of-the-line desktop computer to a computer user in 1984, they'd have more computing capacity than probably the rest of the world combined, but nothing (assuming that you didn't give them a Wi-Fi adapter) about the box would surprise them[^3], nor would it put anybody on the path to duplicating it.

[^3]:  Actually, [microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode)-based architectures, where you have small, high-speed processors emulating the microprocessor that the machine claims to have, *might* represent a new idea.  I don't know if somebody can find it without knowing to look for it, though, since the chip still acts like its specification.

And on the other side of this argument, imagine somebody today desperately needing a computer for something important, and you offer them a [Macintosh 128K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K).  Does that sound like a reasonable response?  And when this aired, the analogy would look more like offering an [IBM 701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701), a device from a time when we probably had fewer than a hundred computers in the world total, and we didn't even have [magnetic core memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory) yet.

 > **LAFORGE**: But my uniform, my visor. Are you saying I'm some blind ghost with clothes?
 >
 > **RO**: I don't have all the answers. I've never been dead before.

I wish that I had something useful to say about this exchange.  It definitely says something about how disinterested everybody feels in Bajoran culture.

 > **DATA**: I suspect they travelled through the transporter beam. That may have been the cause of Geordi and Ro's death. I will go to the Romulan ship. Perhaps I can discover the source of the emissions.

Data does the same "Geordi and Ro" thing that Riker did, presumably to show that he cares more about one than the other, given his interest in the funeral arrangements.

 > **PICARD**: You did know La Forge longer than any of us.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Actually, I was thinking more about Ensign Ro.

Should we brace ourselves for the first eulogy where the speaker follows every assertion with "...if you know what I mean"?

Also, we got indications that La Forge and Riker had history in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}).

 > **DATA**: Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends. I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me as though I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. He accepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. But I do not know how to say goodbye.

Other than Data's weird attempts to pretend that he doesn't display emotions, here---and at least we don't need to listen to him explain it, this time---I notice that Worf seems to grow uncomfortable during this conversation, and I wonder if it has to do with this line.  After all, who accepts Worf for himself?  Everybody either praises him for the times that he has rejected his heritage or treats him like a stereotype.

 > **LAFORGE**: It's supposed to change the structure of matter so it can pass through normal matter and energy. Hang on a second. A few years back, we got intelligence reports that the Klingons were working on trying to combine a phase inverter and a cloaking device. In theory, they believed that a phased ship could hide anywhere, even inside a planet, and that conventional weapons would be useless against it.

Hang onto this thought.  We don't care about it here, but we might have reason to refer back to the story before the end of the series...

 > **LAFORGE**: Data, stop being so rational. Try using your imagination once in a while. These aren't just random patterns, it's me! Hey, watch where you point that thing. Wait a minute, Data, I think you did something here . It's not so easy to push through anymore. The molecules in my hand must have been partially de-phased by the anyon beam. Data, if a low level beam can bring my hand part of the way back, maybe a high level beam can bring me all of the way back. I'll just have to get you to turn up the beam intensity so that. Hey, wait a minute, don't stop now. No, no, no. Data, don't give up on it. It works, I was just creating more fields. Your method is fine. You just need to turn up the intensity, Data.

This brings back the literacy issues that I've mentioned before with episodes such as [*The Mind's Eye*]({% post_url 2024-04-18-mind-s-eye %}):  Why didn't La Forge draw or write something to make the point that an intelligence created the fields, rather than screaming at somebody who can't hear him.  Data sees the points as random, because he *creates* them randomly.  Trace out a giant *G* on the wall, or polygons with increasing sides, and see if Data can dismiss it as random...

 > **PICARD**: Deck ten. I've been thinking about the first time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned to pilot me on an inspection tour, and I made some offhand remark about the shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. And the next morning I found that he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusion initiators. Well, I knew then that I wanted him with me on my next command. Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro?

Starfleet apparently prioritizes people who put their work before their health.  Personally, I've learned never to trust anything produced during an all-night work binge...

 > **PICARD**: if she hadn't lost her rank as a result of that incident at Garon Four, I think she would've made Lieutenant Commander by now.

Wait, really?  I have a clear soft spot for the character, but---again, assuming that the character and performer have roughly the same age---at twenty-seven years old at the time of the episode, that seems like awfully fast advancement.  For comparison, in our timeline, 1980's [DOPMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act) governs minimum qualifications for promotion.  Lieutenant commander requires nine to eleven years of service with minimum time in each rank.

Oh, right.  We have the death certificate, which matches the crew manifest file from [*Conundrum*]({% post_url 2024-08-15-conundrum %}).  That lists Ro's date of birth as 2340 January 17, enrolling in Starfleet Academy in 2358 and graduating in 2362, which both confirms that the Academy does work like a college, and---assuming that almost exactly four seasons after [*The Neutral Zone*]({% post_url 2022-11-10-neutral-zone %})'s 2364 sets this in 2368---establishes Ro as about a year older than Forbes.

Anyway, if Starfleet has something like DOPMA, then this alternate-timeline Ro would still need about another year before her promotion to lieutenant commander, suggesting that Starfleet does allow for more rapid advancement.  Still allows it, I mean, since Captain Kirk (created in pre-DOPMA days) definitely didn't have over twenty years of service when the original series began.

By the way, why do they use the same calendar that we do, when they seemingly have a non-Earth-centric calendar in use throughout the franchise in their stardates?  I assume that Mrs. Ro didn't give birth on Earth, and unless you actually live in Earth's orbit---or in orbit around the Earth, yes---then the year has absolutely no meaning for you.  And that doesn't even go near the issues of information about events needing to travel, which makes up a lot of the background that went into [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity).

You might argue that the prop department did this as an inside joke, and never expected us to pause to read the entire dossier.  But if so, then why did they get the information as close to "correct" as we can expect, given the fictional setting?

Regardless, I hinted at this at the end of last week's post teasing this week, but in a lot of ways, Ro and La Forge listening in on the funeral arrangements to hear what people think about them strongly recalls the funeral scene in [**The Adventures of Tom Sawyer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer), where everybody presumes that young Tom has died and, hearing about it, attends his own funeral with the help of his friends.  And somehow, this does a far better job with Mark Twain than the episode(s) *with* the man as a character, coming up in two and four weeks.

 > **LAFORGE**: Maybe we should develop our own interphase device. If it can teach Ro Laren humility, it can do anything.

Oof, do we really need to go with that as a takeaway?  She has a chip on her shoulder after the system repeatedly failing her and everybody dumping on her, but she seems far more humble than at least half the people in charge of the ship.  But as an outspoken woman, the show (and La Forge) apparently needs to dump on her.

Also, *should* they develop their own device?  As I said above, keep that in the back of your mind---La Forge has mentioned it twice, now---on the (ahem) slim chance that we need to revisit the idea.

## Conclusions

As I mentioned at the top, despite the episode having a lot to like about it, it doesn't give us much to work with.

### The Good

It seems like maybe people have grown more comfortable with grieving, since we see no evidence of the prior demands to compartmentalize a death until a more convenient time arises.

### The Bad

We continue to see the Bajorans presented as some sort of underclass, both in how they seem to consistently get Ro's name wrong, and how they present their spiritual beliefs as barely worth mentioning in the context of death.  They also continue to make a point that Riker gets to discipline Ro more aggressively than anybody else on the ship that we've seen.  Similarly, we see Romulan lives treated as disposable and of a far lower priority than protecting even minor proprietary technology.  And Starfleet apparently imposes the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) on the galaxy.

Along with the racism, we also see sexism in how we still treat Crusher as too emotional and Ro as to mouthy.

The episode also seems to accidentally draw attention to how sterile everybody's interactions feel, where somebody in need of medical attention can try to get anybody's attention without making physical contact with another person or object, and not seem conspicuous.

They praise people who go without sleep to do complete extra work tasks.

### The Weird

It still feels like the crew doesn't actually understand the alphabet, since using it could have sped up parts of their plight.

## Next

Come back in a week, when Picard learns to play a flute, in *The Inner Light*.  Do other things happen?  Sure.  Can you name anything other than the flute without looking it up?  No, you probably can't...
