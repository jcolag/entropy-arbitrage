The world has gotten busy, and recent events have included a lot that I wanted to talk about, but not so much that I could fill an entire post.  And even if they would each fill a post, by the time that I got to some of them, everybody would've forgotten about the context.

![A series of vertical lines with cracks, cut diagonally so that none of the tops and bottoms fit together](/blog/assets/33571225706_a9e3b26803_o.png "...Tag yourself?")

Hence, you can think of this post as a series of mini-posts.  Maybe they'll converge to a point at the end, but I wouldn't count on it.

## Jesse Jackson, RIP

While I don't have as much of a history with [Jesse Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson) as some do, I grew to respect him over time.

Other people have followed his career carefully or even met him.  By contrast, I primarily knew Jackson from his two failed presidential campaigns, where the media portrayed him as a marble-mouthed opportunist who wouldn't stop talking about race and wouldn't go away quietly.  People drew a line from "the bad elements" of the Civil Rights Movement---as in anything that didn't fit the sanitized version that makes white people comfortable---through Jackson to similarly maligned Al Sharpton[^apx2J9].

[^apx2J9]:  Championing Tawana Brawley, even as her case fell apart, fed into every racist and sexist stereotype, and it became highly toxic for a while, probably unfairly.

It took me many years to see through the selective editing---that the media would continue to deploy against any candidate for anything who makes fair points about social progress---and *need* to keep talking about race.  Seeing that let me see the good work that he did for decades, yes, with occasional missteps, and he leaves a powerful legacy behind.

That said, I do find it funny how many people *definitely* remember seeing Jackson on **Sesame Street**, even though it aired before their (and my) births and didn't re-air often until people ripped it from the DVD set for social media.  And I also find it frustrating how many people want to praise him for clearing a path for Bernie Sanders to run for president, happily reducing a civil rights icon to a supporting character in a white man's story.

## Epstein Files

Before we get started on this, don't use this to trivialize or excuse the trivialization of the industrialized child abuse or misogyny found in the files and the publication.  I see them there most prominently, but everybody else has already talked about it, so you don't need to also hear it from me.

Anyway, while you couldn't pay me enough to actually dig through the Epstein files---old Jeffie reportedly built his empire on blackmail, so we could all guess what sorts of atrocities lie in there, even if he didn't have a larger reputation---I have seen a pattern that I don't think that anybody else has commented on:  Behind the repulsive acts, you can see a desperate need from his cronies to feel like part of the in-crowd.  These people would (and did) anything to win the approval of child abuse's answer to Walt Disney.  Only feeling like they have proximity to power really matters to any of them.  Every time that somebody reports on somebody's e-mail angling for an invitation, it shows how pathetic they universally feel.  That fits well with their love of hurting underprivileged people, which reads as needing to cover their impotence.

You might also notice that Epstein served as a hub for almost all right-wing "thinking."  He worked his way to the center of [the Edge {% cc %}](https://www.thenerve.news/p/epstein-billionaires-eugenics-project-harvard-academia-john-brockman), the pseudo-salon that gave you permission to have all sorts of evidence-free ideas over the last few decades, for a big example, but he also [brought anti-transgender activists {% cc %}](https://trans-express.lgbt/post/807892145783570432/epstein-backed-billionaires-dinner-network-of) together, and you see similar thematic work in favor of racism and sexism.  He and cronies also openly see [getting rid of poor people](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01157206.pdf) a valuable goal.

We can't put all the blame on Epstein, nor should we if we want accountability, but it does seem likely that, if you brought any "scientific" bigotry out of the 1990s, you probably learned it partly due to Epstein's influence.  He fits in the tradition now carried on by fake education such as [Prager U {% cc %}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PragerU).  That seems worth calling out more, because it rightly connects those toxic ideas directly to the world's current most toxic brand.

## Sales Pitches

In one of my first not-quite-a-posts in the [newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), in May 2021, I mostly complained for a couple of paragraphs about how ad campaigns had shifted from stating a value proposition in a clever way to goofy antics to at least keep the brand in people's memories, and from there to pitching a service as...terrible.  Insurance, for example, has spent quite a while selling itself as willing to constantly harass you to buy more *and* wear you down so much that you'll need therapy, because what, you'll live without home and car insurance?  That doesn't seem like a service that I want.  But who cares about the value when you have a legal obligation to buy it somewhere, right?

The companies providing AI chatbots, I've noticed, seem to have decided to take this a step further:  Hurry up and get on board.  Do it.  Do it now.  Stop asking questions about whether it will [actually help]({% post_url 2026-01-18-using-ai %}).  Accept that you need it and pipe down.

And it comes off as so desperate.  We see the worthless product that, at its best, can dump out code that it found on Stack Overflow or find synonyms for words in a sentence that you write.  Some people apparently do want that---more on maybe why in a later section, as it'll turn out---but the companies want to show "it doesn't seem worth using to me" as some extremist viewpoint to stomp out.

In a way, this makes some sense.  Silicon Valley hasn't had a great few years for charting out the future.  They insisted, at least a decade too late, that the world should move to cryptocurrencies.  When that didn't work---except among the Epstein class[^3rF2vr], to call back to a prior section, and which probably explains why coin prices started dropping alongside the document releases---and even the proof-of-concept "deeds on the blockchain" (NFTs) went nowhere, they pivoted to insist that we all desperately needed to live our lives in ~~virtual reality~~ the Metaverse{% emoji trademark %}, Facebook so sure of its bet that it rebranded the entire company for its imminent cyberpunk future.  And when that flopped, they pitched LLMs as the future, replacing all the icky *people* in the system with chatbots capable of consistently saying exactly the most generic thing.

[^3rF2vr]:  According to the documents released by the US Department of Justice, Epstein started [pouring money into Bitcoin exchanges](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00680068.pdf) and other infrastructure starting in 2014 and 2015.  From 2016, the price of Bitcoin started rising from a couple-hundred dollars to its first peak of almost nineteen thousand at the end of 2017.  He could have invested for any number of legitimate reasons, but prices started crashing since the end of September 2025, landing between the Epstein estate releasing the "birthday book" (08 September) and the release of the first twenty-three thousand files (12 November), followed by the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.  I don't know how *you* read that, and I wouldn't blame you for dismissing it all as coincidence, but it reads to me like at least half of Bitcoin's value came from wealthy people using it to avoid accountability for whatever they might have done with Epstein, and that rats need to flee the sinking ship before a wallet ID shows up in the files that features in their transaction history.

In other words, this feels like the proverbial third strike against the industry.  And to extend that baseball metaphor, the LLMs keep hitting foul balls as the Chinese companies show that big-AI doesn't actually need to drive up our RAM, hard drive, and energy prices.  Plus, independent researchers even find that you can build a [credible model without alienating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05209) the entire Internet by scraping things that people don't want shared.

And if they don't get widespread adoption quickly, if companies don't fire all their employees soon, then we won't need to commit to the wrong-answer machines.  If we still have a functioning economy, then we can turn off the chatbots and go back to work.  But if they can get rid of the workers and set us at each other's throats fighting for the remaining jobs while our skills deteriorate from interacting with the digital sycophant, then we become reliant on them, even if they never produce anything of value.

It doesn't feel like shouting that we need to hurry up and get hooked will actually get many customers, though...

## Other Bad (Tech) Behavior

Speaking of trying to push people to consume, it seems worth a reminder that [Google still plans to lock Android down](https://keepandroidopen.org/), ensuring that you can only run apps that they approve.  I don't give it much thought because I don't give much attention to mobile devices, but it does seem worth pushing back where we can and look at alternatives.

And note that, even if Google does back down in some meaningful way, instead of continuing their word games---as I have written elsewhere, technically Google only says that they'll refuse to *distribute* unapproved apps, without indicating what happens if the user tries to install such an app outside their flow, which gives them plausible deniability if Android blocks installation for other reasons---they have still laid the groundwork to do this in the future, if the community doesn't take more control of the ecosystem.

You might also want to know that Wikipedia has started [removing Archive Today links {% cc %}](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/), because they have apparently put their resources to bringing down somebody's blog and altered archived pages to attack the same blogger, plus tried to extort the guy.  That makes them unreliable and unpleasant.  That strikes me as a shame[^nqb783], because Archive Today previously felt like a reasonable alternative to the Internet Archive, which has a tendency to center itself in discussions, then [push the boundaries of copyright law]({% post_url 2024-09-08-internet-archive %}) so that they can use the resulting lawsuits to play victim and beg for donations.  But if they can't serve as a passive archive, then I don't see any value, there.

[^nqb783]:  I admittedly check there when I consider sharing pay-walled articles, to make sure that it says what the headline (and people sharing it) says.  I also considered putting in the work to make sure that the blog gets archived there alongside the Internet Archive, but abandoned that when they made it clear that they had no interest in building any interface that didn't go through their human-checking code.

## Playing the Oddities

I worry that we have a gambling problem, or will soon.

In the United States, not too long ago, we legalized online gambling.  This has not only led to a massive and overt marketing push for the apps themselves, but also partnerships with sports leagues and news organizations.  You can now jump on your second-screen and bet on the smallest details of a game---reflecting the sports gambling craze more than a century ago, but with brokers taking a cut---and turn the news into a *game*.

Did I mention that we don't regulate the gambling?  We can already point to several events where somebody in the White House almost certainly made a bet, then influenced policy to turn a massive profit on it.

Meanwhile, it seems increasingly clear that the aforementioned AI tools look a heck of a lot like slot machines.  You feed in tokens and *maybe* you'll get something useful.  Or maybe it'll give you something completely broken.  Sometimes, it'll ignore your question and give you something unrelated.  You can only find out if you shove in more tokens, available through subscription.

Add in the continued attempt to push cryptocurrency, the elimination of pensions, the dismantling of health care because we need to brave the risk, and so forth, and it feels systemic.  It also feels like it might explain why some people take to all these things while some don't, and neither group can fathom what the other group gets out of it.  Maybe those of us who don't catch the gambling bug don't get attached to the AI chatbots and the like, whereas others do.

Granted, I only have my own anecdotal evidence, here, but it feels consistent...and worrying, since we may need to treat gambling addiction at scale, and I don't think that we know how to do that.

## Pledge America

I shouldn't forget FCC Chair and wannabe warlord Brendan Carr's [Pledge America Campaign](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418890A1.pdf), where he begs broadcasters to participate in the Trump administration's "Salute to America 250" by...well, let's quote his list outright.

> - Running PSAs, short segments, or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history.
> - Including segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites.
> - Starting each broadcast day with the “Star Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance.
> - Airing music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, or George Gershwin.
> - Providing daily "Today in American History" announcements highlighting significant events that took place on that day in history.
> - Partnering with community organizations and other groups that are already working hard to bring America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light.

And oh, *please* take him at his word, broadcasters, and monkey's paw the Hell out of it.  Absolutely promote civic education, and be sure to include [Nat Turner's Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_Rebellion) in your American history lesson to show what it sometimes takes to stand up for our rights as citizens of a democracy.  Show off our National Parks and what Trump's budget cuts have done to them.  Run the highly patriotic [*Lift Every Voice and Sing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Every_Voice_and_Sing) alongside *The Star-Spangled Banner*.  If he wants Aaron Copland, you can't do better than labor anthem *Into the Streets, May First*, even before we touch on the potential that recommending Sousa, Ellington, and Gershwin as examples opens up.

I don't think that they *actually* want to "America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light," when they think that means that we only talk about white, straight, cisgender, straight men who inherited wealth.  Broadcasters have the opportunity to celebrate the actual best of this country's history and blame it on the FCC.  Will they?  Probably not.  But he did ask them to do it...

## Tariff Lightning Round

I should mention that the news coverage of [*Learning Resources v Trump*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf) seems bizarre if you glance through the opinion.  Hooray that the tariffs went away, I guess, but a few observations leap to mind.

- Don't cheer yet.  As we saw with higher prices due to COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, now that companies have seen people pay these higher prices, you can bet that they won't lower the those prices back to pre-tariff levels, because that wouldn't mean as high a profit.
- The decision focuses almost entirely on the so-called [major questions doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_questions_doctrine) a nonsense legal fiction that sees government agencies as illegal---or I guess that they can exist, but can't actually do anything---because the Constitution doesn't explicitly say that Congress can delegate food and drug testing, for example.
- Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett misused their (again, fictional) major questions doctrine to replace the idea of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) between the legislative and executive branches, overturning the tariffs because *Congress* did something wrong in their eyes by (I guess) delegating the power, even though they didn't do that.
- Roberts writes an opinion that appears to profusely apologize for failing to side with Trump, scrambling for a line of reasoning that might give Trump what he wants next time.
- Gorsuch writes a concurrence whining about his colleagues and putting words in their mouths to defend the major questions doctrine, which---once again---has no sensible basis in anything.  Heck, he even uses his concurrence to scream at Amy Coney Barrett for not fully committing to his imaginary version of the major questions doctrine; he spends a *lot* of time on this.  And he praises the sharp thinking of the dissenters in the opinion, because it sounds like he regrets not giving Trump everything as much as Roberts.
- Barrett uses her concurrence to call Gorsuch out over his mansplaining.  But she also bows down before the (seriously, totally fictional) major questions doctrine.
- Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson push back against the major questions doctrine and point out that Gorsuch seems hilariously angry.
- Jackson concurs separately to explain to the other Justices how to read.  No, seriously.  "Like the Chief Justice’s opinion, the principal dissent declines the help of legislative history."  "But why would it matter which interpretation *we* think is 'best' when Congress has already told us?"
- Thomas (with Kavanaugh) waxes poetic about his imaginary version of the still-imaginary major questions doctrine, while patting Kavanaugh on the back for "getting it."
- Kavanaugh (with Thomas and Alito) says that the imaginary major questions doctrine totally doesn't count in foreign affairs, therefore Trump can do whatever he wants.  Seriously, "...the Court has *never* before applied the major questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context, including foreign trade."  If only we had a founding document that explained what the different branches of government can and cannot do instead of needing to rely on fan fiction written in 2022, right?  Anyway, he goes on **at length** about this.
- Alito has nothing to say, here, even though this case seems to have everything that he loves to rant about...except for how he thinks that, really, civil rights legislation means that we actually have an obligation to discriminate against disadvantaged folks.

Anyway, I think that I picked out different pieces than they did, but the [Strict Scrutiny {% cc %}](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/strict-scrutiny/) podcast[^GK4-iI]'s overview of the decision convinced me to give it a skim for myself.  They also point out that this decision pretty much gives the power to remedy the situation to Trump, so he still wins, even has he looks for the next law that might give him authority to legislate tariffs, like his new ten percent on everything.

[^GK4-iI]:  Highly recommended, by the way.  I would probably dislike one of them if we ever met, but nobody ever promised me that I'd like everybody...

## Everything Else

Yeah, that didn't come together, except maybe for how the powerful treat the rest of us to compensate for their...limpness, I guess.
