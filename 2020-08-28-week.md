As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The city has started allowing outdoor dining, but only half...only getting 30 to 50 percent of their normal volume.

Generally speaking, it's not a great economic indicator when nobody is taking care of the people whose job it is to take care of others.  There are many examples of this, but this one is the clearest in the obvious disconnect between serving food and access to food.

It might seem trite or excessive to talk about the "psychological accessibility"---for want of a better term---but that's the sort of thing we do every day for ourselves in our own spaces.  The idea that we could do it with some forethought and make things better for people generally is relatively straightforward.

 > ...House Judiciary Committee members have been the recipients of $1 of every $12 in congressional campaign contributions made by Facebook...

This is also, of course, why Facebook cares more about stopping some kinds of extremist speech (environmentalism, opposing right-wing extremists) than others (advocation of violence against foreigners or dark-skinned people, fake medical cures).  Other than the fact that [the latter is better for business]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %}), they want the party in power that's most receptive to protecting monopolies at the expense of small businesses and users.

 > Lithuania remains a likely destination for opposition supporters if the political situation in Belarus deteriorates further.

This is a complicated situation that seems to involve more pieces as it goes, and it's worth watching how it plays out, given how similar the tactics are to what the Trump administration has openly admitted to doing in the United States.

 > ...sheds additional light on the emptiness of DeJoy's promises from his Tuesday press release...

In other cases, postal workers looking to defy that order have discovered parts of the machine missing.  The whole goal is to slow the system down, partly to skew election results and probably mostly to "require" outsourcing USPS labor to the companies DeJoy invests in.  This can't be allowed to continue.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth, seventh, and...heck, even an *eighth* article (because the Oracle/Java mess is a thing to behold, if you're a software person) that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention more generally.

 > This isn't the first time social media companies have removed political content based on this kind of "both sides" false equivalence. In the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook took down #AbolishICE pages used by leftist organizers as part of a purge which targeted white supremacists and right-wing "political influence" campaigns. During that same time, Twitter suspended 80 accounts associated with the Occupy movement, during a purge that targeted far-right 4chan trolls pretending to be liberal activists.
