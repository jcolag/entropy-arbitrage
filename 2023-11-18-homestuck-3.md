This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading **Homestuck** with Act 2, *Raise of the Conductor's Baton*, for the final five scenes.

## Unrelated Plug

I'll almost certainly cover selections at some point soon, ideally making it a semiregular feature for the book club.  Before I get there, though, people who enjoy these posts might want to plunk down a couple of bucks to support Free Culture *as people create it*.

The project that I know about right now?  The [**Fodongo**](https://fodongo.jectoons.net/) zine, an anthology of Free Culture comics, which has the following features that you may find relevant.

 * Each comic carries a license compatible with CC-BY-SA.
 * Emiliano "Jectoons" Carrasco, who you might remember from [**Random Vignettes**]({% post_url 2023-05-13-vignettes %}), organizes the project.
 * Half of every sale gets paid to the artists.
 * If you can't or won't pay, the comics get dribbled out to the project's website over the course of eight weeks.

The first issue, already out now, includes a spooky grocery run, a horror vignette---that I suspect will get a few readers' minds racing---a piece on communications anxiety, and some space weirdness with the Jectoons frog.  And, for three bucks (Canadian, I believe), you get some fun short Free Culture comics, and can discover at least three creators who you may not have known before, who get a cut of your purchase.  Go!  {% emoji backhand index pointing right %}  I'll wait here with the actual post for this week.

## Back to the Post...

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Homestuck**
 * Location:  <https://www.homestuck.com/>, <https://homestuck.net/>, <https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/>
 * Released:  2009 -- 2016
 * License:  Public Domain as of 2020
 * Creator:  Andrew Hussie
 * Medium:  Transmedia Web Comic
 * Length:  Over one million words
 * Content Advisories:  Coarse language, flashing images and rapid motion

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Homestuck

The official website describes the comic as follows.

 > Homestuck is a very long webcomic with a quirky style of narration and presentation that makes it look like an old text adventure game—but really, it's just a linear story that you read and watch, barring some of the flash games. People call Homestuck a multimedia masterpiece because it's got musical segments, playable set pieces, cool animations and everything the World Wide Web will allow an artist to put in it.
 >
 > The plot of Homestuck is infamously convoluted but boils down to: four kids who know each other online play a video game together, inadvertently causing the apocalypse. To beat the game, they have to interact with the game world's characters, and with a disgruntled group of internet trolls.

I also note this later description, detailing why the fandom has bothered certain people.

 > Homestuck was an obscure webcomic appealing mainly to Computer Science nerds and Andrew Hussie's previous fanbase until it reached Act 5 Act 1: Hivebent, or The Part With The Trolls, in 2010. The trolls were twelve characters with strong personalities and a simple, recognizable, easily replicable visual template (custom blood colors, horns, zodiac signs on simple clothing).

Anyway, I had never heard of it---or if I did, the name didn't register---until I saw a bunch of people in various online places talking about it.  Investigating, I noticed that someone had built an application to replay the entire series *and* that the copyright at the bottom of the official page reads as follows.

 > Public Domain 2020 -- ∞

Much like [**Green Comet**]({% post_url 2023-06-03-green-comet-1 %}), it would take too long to get through the entire story, so we'll only cover the first two Acts of the story for now, and will maybe return to it at a later date.

## What Works Well?

Sections about Rose have an impressive tension to them.  I wish that the story spent more time, there.

The Wayward Vagabond also makes for a lovely change of pace for the story, with a character who brings something entirely new to the story and also has a whimsical aspect.  When these sections indicate a connection with prior scenes, it adds texture to them.  And it ends with a solid setup for the rest of the story.

And speaking of that setup, it looks like we finally have a story with some intention.  It has spent a lot of time messing around with side-exposition, but it seems like the various facets now have at least a rough focus.

## What Works...Less Well?

I continue to not understand the point of the sections about Dave.  He seems to take up more time than the other characters to not accomplish anything, and then repeat a "joke" from some other section to remind us that his story happened in the past and had no effect on the rest.

And I've ignored the issue, so far, because the story never focuses on it significantly, but this section feels like it relies *far* too much on (non-Free) pop-culture references.  Granted, this might come from the project only receiving its public license after it completed, but it still feels like a concern.

## Opportunities

Oh, goodness.  I told you that pretty much everybody had seen this except me, right?  The [official page](https://homestuck.net/index.html) notes a [Reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck) and [Discord community](https://discord.gg/homestuck).  Fans have shown up at conventions.  You can download art assets and fan-oriented resources.  Sometimes the creator sells merchandise.

The comic has a robust ecosystem, in other words.

## What's Adaptable?

This section brings us **The Daily Hornographer**, though I didn't see much else among the barrage of real-world brands.

## Next

We'll put aside **Homestuck** for the duration, now that we've gotten a taste.  I enjoyed a lot of what we saw, so I'll probably return to it when I start revisiting prior works and creators, but next time, we'll "sample" another similarly long work, spending four weeks reading the first six chapters of **A Vessel for Offering**, starting with the first two chapters, next week.

As mentioned previously, by the way, the list of potential works to discuss has run low, so I need to ask for help, again.  If you know of any works---or want to create them---that fit these posts (fictional, narrative, Free Culture, available to the public, and not by creators who we've already discussed), please tell me about them.  Every person who points me to at least one appropriate work with an explanation will receive a free membership on [my {% emoji latte %} Buy Me a Coffee page](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic to this point?  Do you have a longer history with it than I do?  Would you like to tell me where I got everything wrong because of some far-future chapter?
