In the United States, particularly New York, today we celebrate [Harriet Tubman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman_Day), the anti-slavery activist, Underground Railroad "conductor," scout/spy for the United States Army during the Civil War, nurse, suffragette, and more.  At least once, [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass) made the point that---unlike himself---she operated without support and largely by walking repeatedly into danger.  Support-wise, her social justice work certainly didn't pay, nor did her nursing, and the Army ponied up a whopping two hundred bucks, which would equate to about four thousand, today, for wartime spy work, and that only gives you the tiniest view of her story.

Now that we all feel inadequate in comparison, on to the projects.

## Open Badges

{% github jcolag/badging %}

The feature needs more research to work out what it actually needs, but after generating public and private keys last time, the badges now include at least the potential for the required "proof."  Without getting this right, the badges become a free-for-all, where anybody can claim that somebody issued them any credential, which defeats the purpose.  As it currently stands, the code should correctly create the signature, given the proper input.

On a lower level, the metadata that probably doesn't change between badges or organizations now stands apart in its own function.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

We have one-and-a-half changes, this week, after a few months of me mostly using my note-taking application as-is.

For the full change, select Markdown rules can now clear other rules in their space.  I noticed the necessity of this when dumping some example [YAML](https://yaml.org/) into a note as an example for some possible upcoming project.  Unfortunately, YAML has syntax elements that strongly resemble those in Markdown.  Let's take a quick hypothetical example.

```YAML
# Singular, plural, symbol
name:
- dollar
- dollars
- $
```

If you know Markdown, then you might already see the problem.  If the editor code doesn't refuse to style anything inside the "code fence," then the comments render as top-level headings, and the list comes out like a bulleted list, which in **Notoboto**'s case has different indentation.

The half-change, by contrast, starts the process of adding a pop-up document map.  I have some *long* notes---more than ten have more than ten thousand words, with a couple near a hundred thousand---that should probably become categories with multiple notes.  But until I break them up, which may not happen, the software should make the note easier to navigate.

It seems a bit clunky at times, but Tk has a [tree view](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl/TkCmd/ttk_treeview.htm) widget should do at least most of the heavy lifting, letting the code collect all headings and arrange them hierarchically.  Right now, the code only creates the window with the widget, with no way of opening or populating it.

## Next

I want to finish up the work on **Notoboto**, mostly.  After I have that done, maybe I'll look into adding notes in Markdown, so that it doesn't need to rely on my clunky CSON code as much.

And with any luck, by that time, I'll have figured out what needs to go into that Open Badge signature.
