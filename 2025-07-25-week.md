As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I definitely wouldn't call this the most important story of the week, but to cross the streams a bit, this reminded me a lot of the [**Aether Age**]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %}) stories, though they got to travel the Solar System instead of crouching in caves.

 > Trump financier Elon Musk has previously claimed that Trump‚Äôs name was in Epstein‚Äôs files, but with the administration obfuscating on the details, the full truth has not come out.

The content warning almost included "Please excuse Jeff and Donnie.  Teenagers kidnapped them and tied them up on a private island.  Signed, Epstein's mother."  But I realized that would obscure the issue.  And half the people out there probably wouldn't recognize the joke.

Note that I doubt that these files would actually incriminate Trump, but they'll certainly embarrass everyone in his circle.

Soon after the election, I published a post on my [fears, anger, and hopes after the second Trump election]({% post_url 2024-11-10-election %}).  In that, I said---and still stand by it---that everybody who chose not to vote for Harris owns *every* death caused by this administration.  It shouldn't surprise anybody that the bodies have already started piling up.

I'll have more about installing YaCy in Monday's developer diary post, but I felt the need to publicly declare victory, especially since I know so many people wringing their hands about finding a search engine that hasn't gone completely to seed, yet.

 > Part of the problem is that public goods like the National Weather Service are ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù ‚Äî that is, you don‚Äôt notice them when they‚Äôre working well. This makes them uniquely vulnerable to calls for budget cuts, because who‚Äôs going to notice under-staffing at the NWS?

Conservatives have also spent decades turning people against public agencies.  They want us to hate paying taxes, so that we cheer when they gut tax collection, even though taking resources out of tax collection focuses their attention on low-level offenses like ourselves, rather than billionaires who can afford to hide their crime and fight the prosecution.  Likewise, they've pushed the "never trust the weather forecast" narrative forever, no matter the real accuracy, almost certainly so that we'll shrug as they cut funding.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Amidst the restrictions for women, there are still small and diverse pockets of resistance. They come in the form of free online courses, mentoring programs, distribution of educational materials, miniature home industries, local women‚Äôs organizations, and covert schools. Examples include¬†the [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu/), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/press/futurelearn-commemorates-two-years-of-its-higher-education-initiative-for-women-and-girls-in-afghanistan#:~:text=Since%20December%202022%2C%20FutureLearn%20has,ban%20on%20women's%20higher%20education.),¬†and the initiatives led by the Afghanistan Law & Political Science Association and the [Herat Online School](https://childrenontheedge.org/how-we-help/education/online-education-for-girls-from-afghanistan), which provides college-level education.

The resistance seems especially important to follow, here.  You never know who might need something like it...

 > Project 2025 is an anthology, edited by the Heritage Foundation, collecting the post-victory aspirations of the most important members of the Trump coalition. As anthologists, Heritage's job was to choose which submissions to include and which ones to reject. Perlstein's key insight is that wherever Heritage included two or more directly contradictory plans in Project 2025, we can infer the groups that submitted those plans are each too powerful and important to sideline ‚Äì they are equally matched combatants, and it's impossible to predict which one will get their way and which ones will eat shit in the aftermath of a victory.

I have posted a lot about this, because it hasn't become any less true.  Republican voters hate each other as much as they hate everybody else, and only hold their nose to support Trump.  People have made such a big deal about micro-sabotaging the government, but the vulnerabilities lie in the shaky coalition, not clogging up some voicemail that they probably never would've checked.  They have libertarians trying to stand shoulder to shoulder with oligarchs and theocrats.  They want government hands off everybody's personal lives, but others of them also want to impose their weird view of normality on everybody.  And this week, they want to blow the Epstein investigation wide open, but they also want to cover it up so that they don't embarrass anybody with power.

We shouldn't fight them.  We need to set them fighting each other.
