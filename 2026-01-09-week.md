As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I can't imagine that it will come as a surprise to anybody that the Trump administration wants to make it impossible to get help if your dangerous job harms you.

More flippantly, it reminds me of my first "real" job.  While I sat with the Human Resources person filling out forms, they asked why I didn't check the box to deduct for the Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance.  I could only think to ask what the heck kind of work that they expected me to do...

 > From booing Trump at football games to flipping off Trump Tower, people found numerous ways to voice their dissent, displeasure and defiance. Each time someone spoke up, it emboldened others to take a visible stand, too.

This goes through almost everything as kind of a mild amusement directed at solidarity, but I feel like it would help more to think about these resistance actions based on how much they provoked a reaction by the administration.  We keep making this mistake, refusing to capitalize on the actions that provoke Trump into another incoherent rage, instead finding it *hilarious* to fill up an e-mail inbox with garbage, which I guarantee had no real impact.

I hate that we even need to have this conversation with people, these days.  We actually have examples of towns that stopped fluoridating their water, and---surprise---it maps to a sudden increase in false teeth.

I know that we don't want to interrupt an enemy when they make a mistake, but I love how their broken Epstein strategy---loudly covering things up, which serves to keep the story in the news and the public eye, because they can't shut up about it---has now infected everything that they do.  They spent decades leading the discourse around by the nose, and now they can't figure out how to shake the attention...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Past analyses that did show shifts focused on short-term changes, especially those brought about by manipulations in the way the study subjects were asked to categorize themselves.

The article itself worries me, because it seems to think of this as a *bad* thing, for some reason, instead of admitting that we really only have two classes, at this point, the billionaire class and everybody else who they want to impoverish.  Reducing class identity can only help us organize against them.
