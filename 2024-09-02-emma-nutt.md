Yesterday, we celebrated [Emma Nutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nutt) Day, who became the world's first female telephone operator.

OK, I realize my mistake in choosing this.  Gather 'round, kids.

![Emma and Sheila Nutt operating the Edwin Holmes's telephone exchange in 1878](/blog/assets/Emma-and-shiela-nutt-1878.png "When someone says that they'll patch you through to someone else, that refers to the patch cables that you see linking one slot to another")

A long time ago, ~~in a galaxy f~~ telephones interacted across wires[^1] running from your handset to the wall, up to the pole, to the central office, maybe to another central office, and then the reverse to whoever you spoke to.  At the central offices, before we computerized their jobs away, we had people who we called "telephone operators," who'd look at your outgoing calls and physically connect your line with the person who you wanted to talk to, through a literal switchboard.  They'd also handle early technical support, but that didn't come up as often.

[^1]:  A [series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes), you might even say...

Ms. Nutt broke the glass ceiling when the male operators in Boston---apparently including Nutt's husband William Evart---started acting up and playing pranks beyond what the company would tolerate, and so began hiring women to spite them.  Yeah, it sounds sexist when we put it that way, but you get the idea, the industry excluded women until somebody took a chance on Nutt.  And speaking of sexism, the telephone operator would quickly become a stereotypically feminine occupation, with a lot of the same issues---low pay, harassment, and so forth---that has historically gone with the territory.

You can also insert my usual early September rant, here, groaning about the [American version of Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day) that steadfastly avoids referring to the labor movement, to the point that the news will invariably stop at referring to it as "the unofficial end of summer" and probably look at some military demonstration and back-to-school sales.  It can't focus on unions, after all, because that might give somebody a whiff of {% sfx gasp! %} communism...

And on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

Once again, I needed to clean up some messy bits that I left lying around after the recent overhauls of the blog code, though I think that one significant improvement also came through.

Again, because I had to go through a lot of little pieces, I'll break this up into subsections, even though these shouldn't run as long as some recent posts.

### Image Shrinking

Following the shift to AVIF images, I noticed---I hope before anybody else did---that the blog plugin that I use to embed small images over in the margins "didn't get the memo" that I converted the images.  And so, this update takes the cheap route out.

```ruby
def render(_context)
  alt, url, title = params @text
  avif = "assets/#{url}.avif"
  url = "#{url}.avif" if File.exist? avif
  "<img alt=\"#{alt}\" class=\"image-right\" " \
    "src=\"/blog/assets/#{url}\" title=\"#{title}\">"
end
```

If the AVIF file exists, then it swaps out the filename, all on line #4.  And if anybody did happen to visit one of the twenty-five posts that include an "image off to the side" before I fixed it, please accept my apologies.

### Generating the Tags

It takes more work and time, because tags now have multiple semantically identical variants, due to the hyphenation, but it seems to all hold together.  The tag-generation script starts out---after collecting the list of pages to deploy---by running through every unique tag across all posts.

If the tag's name has a dash in it, the script generates a "stub" that redirects to the "real" page.  Otherwise, it generates the normal tag page.  Finally, it creates an index page at `/blog/tag/` to redirect people to `/blog/tags/`; I mistype this often enough that it bothered me.

### Tag Pages

Rendering the individual tag pages then iterate through the posts looking for hyphenated variations, adding them to the page title.  It then checks for an optional description of the tag---more on that later---and then lists all posts including any tag-variant.  The tag index does some similar extra work to count up the number of posts across the variations, too.

Speaking of the index, for at least a day or so, the [tag page](/blog/tags/) itself broke by appending a *comma* to every tag, for some reason, but I think that I have everything running, now.

### Other Scripts

After that, the script that generates the skeleton of each week's [social media roundup](/blog/tag/link-dump) post now hyphenates its tags (and adds a table of contents), and the script that generates the text for social media announcements drops any hyphens from the post tags.

### Tag Descriptions

That leaves the tag descriptions that I mentioned above.  It occurred to me, in all this work, that a typical tag page doesn't provide any context, and where I have multiple tags with a close relationship, it doesn't provide any insight into why posts appear here and not there, or why this kind of post got mixed up with that kind.  For example, the posts about [*Star Trek*](/blog/tag/star-trek) all have the [close reading](/blog/tag/close-reading) tag, because those come out of the idea of focusing on what the episodes genuinely show us instead of accepting what characters say.  The latter category doesn't yet, but it *should* include the times that I dig through laws and court decisions, such as my [analysis of *Roe v Wade*]({% post_url 2022-05-15-roe %}).

To solve that problem, the tag pages can now have a note at the top explaining these things and, in especially contentious cases, provides a place to link to the related category that readers will probably want to see instead.  Currently, I've added brief overviews to [advice](/blog/tag/advice/), [announcement](/blog/tag/announcement/), [blog](/blog/tag/blog/), [book club](/blog/tag/book-club/), [books](/blog/tag/books/), [close reading](/blog/tag/close-reading/), [dev journal](/blog/tag/dev-journal/), [education](/blog/tag/education/), [fiction](/blog/tag/fiction/), [free culture](/blog/tag/free-culture/), [indie web](/blog/tag/indieweb/), [let's fix](/blog/tag/letsfix/), [link dump](/blog/tag/link-dump/), [media](/blog/tag/media/), [new year](/blog/tag/new-year/), [oopsie](/blog/tag/oopsie/), [programming](/blog/tag/programming/), [programming languages](/blog/tag/programming-languages/), [Quora](/blog/tag/quora/), [politics](/blog/tag/politics/), [rant](/blog/tag/rant/), [recipe](/blog/tag/recipe/), [social showdown](/blog/tag/social-showdown/), [Star Trek](/blog/tag/star-trek/), [superhero](/blog/tag/superhero/), and [tech tips](/blog/tag/tech-tips/), if you want to see how the format shows or have any suggestions on improving the explanations.

I'll add to that list and refine the descriptions as I think of things, but this should improve the use of the pages for the majority of people.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

While I never expected to want to do this, I decided on a whim to show images embedded in notes.  I originally didn't care, because I never used the feature at all often, and launching the note as HTML does a decent enough job.  But I have projects where images might start helping, so it seemed time to take care of it.

In short, images in Markdown, if they have the following format, then they'll show up in the text widget, assuming that somebody stored the image file in the note directory tree, the `:storage` path needing to map to the notes' root folder.

```Markdown
![Caption](:storage/image-file-name.png "Title text")
```

In practice, however, it takes more work than I expected.  I can scrape through the Markdown to find images in that form, and then do this to embed the image after the link.

```Tcl
set image [image create photo -file $imagePath]
$widget image create $matchEnd -image $image
```

We have a problem, though, that the code doesn't do this once globally and forget.  Like syntax highlighting---in fact, I piggyback on the existing code for that, since it does something similar---it runs whenever the user changes notes or whenever the user pauses in typing.  And that causes huge problems, because `$image` vanishes when the procedure ends, removing it from view, as well.

To fix that, I needed a global variable to store all images in the note.

```Tcl
lappend imagesList $image
```

Mind you, nobody seems to *mention* that in any of the documentation, for whatever reason...

## The Light's Edge (Toys)

{% codeberg jcolag/lights-edge-toys %}

First, some changes to how the project handles licensing.

These toys have become my first test of [REUSE](https://reuse.software/), an [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/) initiative[^3] to help people reduce the complexity and confusion around extracting Free-licensed content from a project.  While I probably won't do this for older projects, especially if I haven't touched them in a long time, this seemed like a good point to experiment.

[^3]:  I feel the need to point out how much more engaging and informative their quick onboarding video feels---while also coming off as entirely inoffensive---in comparison to the awful [advertisements]({% post_url 2021-05-15-fsf %}) that the U.S. version of the FSF put out in hopes of getting donations...

In short, after installing their `reuse` tool, I ran the following.

```console
reuse download CC-BY-SA-4.0
reuse addheader --copyright "John Colagioia" --license "CC-BY-SA-4.0" .gitignore README.md LLL-1/lll-1.scad
reuse lint
```

The first line---to nobody's surprise, I'd imagine---downloads one or more license texts and places them in a `LICENSES` sub-folder.  The second adds copyright-and-license headers to the specified files.  For example, the OpenSCAD code now says this at the top.  If you use this, feel free to go the more pedantic route of specifying the copyright symbol &#xa9; in your copyright statement.  But the overwhelming majority of countries eliminated the need for explicit copyright statements decades ago[^4], so the careful formation of the statement doesn't have any legal meaning.  You do want to provide enough information for people to credit you and, for any people in regimes where copyright still attaches to it, date of publication.

[^4]:  While I don't want to get off on an anti-copyright rant because I largely stopped having huge problems with copyright when I stopped following corporate media so closely, but automatic copyright and renewal, I think, makes for some of the worst aspects of how things have evolved.  For example, repeating (with or without alterations) somebody's social media post without explicit permission *technically* violates their copyright, even though they probably didn't give it any thought.

```OpenSCAD
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 John Colagioia
//
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0
```

The headers adapt themselves to the kind of file, so the `README.md` file starts with an HTML comment, and the `.gitignore` file starts with a script-style comment, lines starting with a pound-sign.  In cases where you can't reasonably add a text-based header to the file---think of an image or a JSON configuration---it creates a `your-file.license` file with the equivalent contents.

This does mean that you need to know the [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for any licenses governing all content that you end up using, but it at least keeps everything consistent.  At this point in the process, if done right, every file should specify its license and original owner, and each of those licenses has its text in a common spot with a clear label.

Finally, the `lint` step checks to make sure that we've done everything right, reporting any problematic licenses, files without the appropriate information, and so forth.

Once I get rid of my original license file, the project complies with the specification, meaning that you can quickly check the licensing of any part of the project, either manually or programmatically.  If you grab a random file---not that you have many to choose from, right now---then you have enough information to license it correctly[^2].  More importantly, if your project follows the same standard, then you can pull out a file with its licensing information and drop it right into your setup without losing any information.

[^2]:  Notoboto would probably make a better example of why this would matter than a project with only one real file, because the buttons and menu items over there use [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).  There, my code falls under the AGPL v3 as the project license says, but the icons fall under the Apache 2.0 license, with Google as the copyright holder.  I point this out in the `README` file, but REUSE provides the information closer to where somebody would actually want it.  In that sense, it makes a good candidate for this standard.  Similarly for the website repository for [**The Light's Edge**](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/thelightsedge), which includes images from a variety of sources that I currently credit in the `README`.

Like I said, I probably won't go back to many projects to add this licensing help, but for new and active projects where it doesn't feel like a huge burden, I'll probably give it a chance, since it looks more reliable than a single license file in the root of every repository.  For a good example of what I mean by "a burden," consider the repository for [the blog's assets](https://gitlab.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-assets).  Getting that mess to comply with REUSE would probably help more than the monster licensing file that I generate, *but* I would then need to specify the license for over a thousand files, manually double-checking each file's actual license, which would take up far too much of my time.

Second---and I apologize that the "first" took so long---I've improved LLL-1 further, cleaning up the screw assembly and the pegs that attach the limbs to the main body, and improved the position of the leg recesses, so that e has...well, a *butt*, if you need me to say it.  In previous versions, I let the recesses drift too far back, making the figure mostly symmetrical.  This change re-hides the hip connections from behind.

## Next

I didn't have time to finish it for this post, but this week will definitely, finally see at least one vehicle model for LLL-1, possibly with a couple of 3D-printed accessories to make it look more serious.

As you can see in the footnotes, I might also expect **Notoboto** and maybe other small projects to get the REUSE treatment.  Otherwise, I don't know, maybe I'll start a new project or go back to something that I've neglected.
