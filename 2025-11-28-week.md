* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The findings confirmed that, even when holding the facts and platform constant, learning from synthesized LLM responses led to shallower knowledge compared to gathering, interpreting and synthesizing information for oneself via standard web links.

Hashtags:  #AI #Education

It absolutely astounds me that the software industry looked at a long-desired technology that actually has many good uses, and has systematically shoved it everyplace that it does a terrible job instead.  We *could* have refined semantic searches, proofreading that can point out things like "you haven't defined this term" or "you already described this," or helps to automate testing online security.  Instead, we can generate garbage or suffer through the worst versions of education...

 > Further, the bill imposes new work requirements despite the fact that 91 percent of families on SNAP that have working-age, non-disabled adults and children are already working. The USDA determined that work requirements have no effect on increasing employment among SNAP recipients.

Everybody seems too polite to actually say this, so I might as well:  The administration and its supporters do and permit this, because the Federal government has proudly employed Black people for decades, pulling many families out of poverty.  Therefore, they want to wipe out the bureaucracy, put the workers on welfare programs, and make the welfare programs unstable, onerous, and insulting.

 > Anti-trafficking is the child of colonial legacies, development aid and philanthropy, and it is an obedient child at that. Like its parents, it reinforces the same hierarchies of power and knowledge without question.

Way back when I spent time on Quora, and right-wing types constantly wrung their hands about "radical" feminists or whatever, I'd point out that radical actually means something like favoring change starting at root causes.  And with that in mind, why would you ever approach your movement as anything *but* radical?  I certainly don't want to treat symptom after symptom...

I had a couple of minutes and figured that I could do worse than post.

 > Even with third-party companies like Checkr doing the work, as is the case with third-party age verification that’s swept the U.S. and targeted the porn industry, increased data means increased risk of it being leaked or hacked.

Much like with the rest of these new checks governments have pushed, I don't care about the specific site or even the industry, but making creators---especially creators already frequently targeted by both government and criminals, not to mention the creepiest of stalkers---less safe in the name of some notional purity doesn't help anybody.  Denying a path to legitimately earning a living to people who have paid (more than) their debts to society only reinforces existing inequalities.

And OK, maybe I grossly misunderstand how a website that I've never looked at works, but I fail to see the danger in allowing people to subscribe to see a nipple or clitoris or whatever that has spent time in prison.

Between the constant mass layoffs, the return-to-office orders, the cramming of useless AI into every task, and so forth, it doesn't take much to imagine that happening.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > In witnessing this wreckage here in the South, and tracing the lines from our storms to our prisons, I finally understand Octavia Butler's _Parables_ not as prophecy, but as an autopsy. Butler's scalpel laid bare, in her time, the corpse of our present—a South where unceasing disaster is not an exception, but an expectation.

Regular readers know that I have beat this sort of drum---that dystopia warns you about the present, not the future---for years, now, most recently [earlier this month]({% post_url 2025-11-09-look-around %}) in its own post, so I appreciate somebody else picking up the same idea.
