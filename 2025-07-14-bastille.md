Today, much of the French-influenced world celebrates (what, in English, we call) [Bastille Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day)[^1], commemorating the storming of the armory and political prison, which...well, the government planned to demolish it and didn't have many prisoners inside, but it largely symbolized royal authority, making its capture a critical early propaganda victory in the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution).

[^1]: The French use much more exotic names, such as "French National Day" and the "Fourteenth of July."  Though I suppose that I can't laugh too hard, since only ten days ago, my own country celebrates "the Fourth of July."  But if you question why I don't use the native name of the holiday, especially in one of the few languages that I can even *claim* to know to any reasonable degree, the boring names probably provide some insight.  If I wanted to name posts after the date, then I'd do that instead of looking for holidays.  And yes, I realize that last week's choice of holiday took its name from the date...

Also, to those celebrating this sort of thing, have a happy [Netlabel Day](https://netlabelday.org/), sort of the predecessor of the other Free Culture-related movement holidays.  Like a lot of people, they don't distinguish between the legitimate and useless Creative Commons licenses, and therefore you'll find a *lot* of non-commercial and no-derivatives music that you "have permission to share," but you'll probably find something to like.

Anyway, on to the week's projects.

## Argh, Part 4

This week, things have started to shape up, I think, though with some inevitable imperfections.

### Mini-Server, Part 2

As mentioned last time, I have a second old Raspberry Pi.  If memory serves, I had it slated to run one of the Free Software voice assistants, on the chance that they'd prove useful.  It looks like my initial assessment---that I could wait the things out---bore out, considering that people use them far less, these days, and I never touched the little computer.

In any case, it now runs [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.org/), providing me with a lightweight office suite, relatively speaking.  With some [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) magic to supplement it, that gives me a full set of document types.

It takes effort to install the thing, though, because all the documentation assumes that you'll want to either run it for testing or out on the open Internet with full security for a large community. Oh, and the names. You can't run CryptPad from a folder (`http://computer.local/cryptpad`) and the mDNS that lets your computers name themselves on the local network doesn't allow anything that looks like a subdomain (`http://cryptpad.computer.local`; technically, `.local` serves as the domain, on local networks), so the service needs to at least pretend to have only one machine name.

For whoever needs this in the future, this worked for me.

- Install [Avahi Aliases](https://github.com/scott-ainsworth/avahi-aliases) on the computer where CryptPad will run.
- Give that computer a second name, as in `sudo avahi-add-alias cryptpad.local`.
- Clone the CryptPad repository as a dedicated user.
- Follow the normal directions, in terms of installing the libraries and editing the configuration, especially using that new system name in `httpUnsafeOrigin`.
- Set up CryptPad as a service, probably using [their sample](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/blob/main/docs/cryptpad.service) for systemd.
- Set up the web proxy, stripping down something like their [NGINX configuration](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/blob/main/docs/example.nginx.conf), which ends up looking like the following.

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name cryptpad.local; # or whatever

    location / {
        proxy_pass            http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header      X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header      Host $host;
        proxy_set_header      X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        client_max_body_size  150m;

        proxy_http_version    1.1;
        proxy_set_header      Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header      Connection upgrade;
    }

    location ^~ /cryptpad_websocket {
        proxy_pass            http://localhost:3003;
        proxy_set_header      X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header      Host $host;
        proxy_set_header      X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_http_version    1.1;
        proxy_set_header      Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header      Connection upgrade;
    }
}
```

From the example, I took all the information from the SSL/TLS site (port 443) and used that for the "old-style" (port 80) site instead of forwarding to SSL/TLS-land.

Start (or restart, depending on your situation) the CryptPad and web server (NGINX, for me) services, and check CryptPad's status for the setup URL. From there, follow the directions. Whew...

I also experimented with [File Browser](https://filebrowser.org/), hoping that I could move my working copy of the blog to a server, maybe making it faster to publish[^2]. It technically worked, but since it primarily wants to *explore* the file system and only edits incidentally, it has no syntax highlighting, and only supporting one file at a time means.  At that point, if I did move the files, it'd make as much sense to log in with `ssh` and edit with `vi`, instead...

[^2]:  During the week, one post went out much later than I planned, because Jekyll's build process took up enough memory to crash the system.

For various reasons, I couldn't work out how to install the following applications over there.

- [Nodebook](https://github.com/netgusto/nodebook) - It doesn't have a native Raspberry Pi build, and I had trouble getting its own Go build setup to work for me.  I did complete a normal cross-compile, but while it technically runs, it doesn't actually do anything.  However, a straight build *does* work on my (non-ARM) laptop.  I do like the idea of having a handy space---other than opening yet another terminal---to test out an API or algorithm.
- [Cloverleaf](https://cloverleaf.app/) - I couldn't find a build step, here.  It styles everything with SASS, and the repository has no `index.html` file, which means that they must *have* a build step, but I had no luck finding one that would run.  I probably wouldn't actually use it often, but the idea of a consistent password generator---it works some math on your (Cloverleaf) password and the name of the account to create a unique string---feels like a good complement for a broader password manager, if only because it would mean that I could quickly access key sites[^3] even when I can't access the password manager.

[^3]:  Think delivery sites, these days, where I might visit someone's house and want to either order groceries to cook them something or order from a local restaurant to save them the trouble of cooking.  Back when I still subscribed to and overused Prime, I set a not-so-great-but-memorable password on my Amazon account, for times when I went on vacation and needed something on-site, a similar idea.

If anybody has input on how to get them working, or a better option for a web-based lightweight text editor, I'd love to hear it.

### Data Recovery

I finally gave up on finding or writing some tool to convert my calendar from Thunderbird into an ICS file. Instead, I quickly installed Thunderbird and...actually, now that I think about it, this'll take some explanation.

In theory, you can drop the old calendar database into the new `calendar-data` folder, or replace that folder, except that the software doesn't know what to look for in the database; it'll treat it like an empty database that happens to have other stuff cluttering the tables. After you do that, then, open the database with SQLite to run `SELECT DISTINCT cal_id FROM cal_events;` and note those values. From there, edit `prefs.js` and replace the ID that it uses in all the calendar entries with one that you got from the database.

Open Thunderbird and export the calendar, if you want that calendar's information; for an example of where I didn't, I had a Trash/Recycling schedule from a couple of years back in my database, which won't help me much today. Either way, close Thunderbird, move to the next ID, and do it again until you run out of IDs.

Presumably, the file has some syntax that supports multiple calendars, since Thunderbird does that, but I didn't feel like spending time on a second research project for this.  You can also go the other way, taking the ID from `prefs.js` and updating every row in the database to use it, but that felt bad...

Likewise, I have *finally* gotten the data out of the old GNOME Authenticator database.  And I don't know that I've needed to do anything *this* ugly before.  You might want to strap in, for this one, and have the little ones avert their eyes.

- Export GNOME Authenticator's data, because this feels dicey enough that you'll want a backup.
- Backup GNOME Authenticator's configuration, something like moving `.var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator/` to `.var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator.bk`, in my case.
- Copy the old GNOME Authenticator configuration into the original's place, `cp -r /from/wherever /to/the/above/spot`.  I know.  "That doesn't look ugly to me, John.  It looks pretty routine for recoveries, in fact."  Give it a second.
- Back up the machine's keyrings, something like `mv .local/share/keyrings/ .local/share/keyrings.bk`.
- Copy the old machine's keyring(s) into the original's place. {% emoji face with peeking eye %}
- Stop the GNOME keyring service, and because it doesn't have an affordance to do so, we take the direct approach.  `pkill -15 gnome-keyring-d`. {% emoji face screaming in fear %}
- Open GNOME Authenticator.  This will restart the keyring service for you, and ask you to unlock the keyring with your password, which in this case comes from the *old* machine.
- If that failed to get you what you need, start undoing all the previous steps, because I don't know what to tell you.  For everybody else, export the data, the thing that we came here for.
- Delete the old GNOME Authenticator data (`rm -rf .var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator/`) and move the current data back into place (move `.var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator.bk/` back to `.var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator`).
- Do the same for the keyring.  `rm -rf .local/share/keyrings/` and `mv .local/share/keyrings.bk/ .local/share/keyrings`.
- Stop the GNOME keyring service again, `pkill -15 gnome-keyring-d`.
- Open GNOME Authenticator again, re-authenticate with the current computer's password.
- Import the backup and confirm that nothing from either side of the fence got lost along the way.
- Eventually, reboot, when not having the SSH keys handled starts to become annoying, because resetting the keyring definitely did that, and I couldn't find a quick way to get it back on track.  Something probably does exist, though.

If you want a quick summary of that monstrosity, swap out the Authenticator and keyring data, stop the keyring daemon, export, then repeat the process swapping everything from the current machine back into place.

Along the way, because I *really* didn't want to take this route, I tried out multiple scripts that claimed to export the relevant information, but nothing worked.  This, horrific and error-prone as it looks, actually did work, with no snags except for making me feel extremely anxious that I might break something...

Now, I "only" need to find a way to schedule an export of the two-factor authentication data, so that my ability to recover in the future doesn't rely on my ability to remember to manually export it or the nail-biting process above.  The [Rust code to fetch from the keyring](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Authenticator/-/tree/master/tools/keyring-fetcher?ref_type=heads) seems like the start to that, if I need to build something, thanks to the kind folks on the [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#authenticator:gnome.org).  The "fetcher" grabs the (encrypted and base-64-encoded) token information from the database, plus the "secret" from the keyring.  The output looks like this, with actual data instead of the nonsense that I filled in.

```
Found a secret: 
Attributes: {
    "application": AttributeValue(
        "com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator",
    ),
    "token_id": AttributeValue(
        "$argon2id$v=49$m=53959,t=1,p=VGhpcyBpcyBhIFJBTkRPTSBzdHJpbmcsIG5vdCB0aGUgYmluYXJ5IGJsb2IgeW91IHNob3VsZCBleHBlY3QgdG8gc2VlLg==",
    ),
    "type": AttributeValue(
        "token",
    ),
}
Secret: "SOMEALPHANUMERICSTRING0123456789"
################################################
```

If I can use the secret to decrypt the token, directly or with another step common to all the tokens, that'll give me my automated export without too much fuss.  When the output changes, I can encrypt it and push it out to some server for retrieval when I need it, similar to how [my password manager of choice](https://www.passwordstore.org/) stores everything as encrypted text files in a git repository.

## Stenotype Corner

I don't have anything to report, this week, other than that I've continued using the keyboard for as much routine work as I could. I find myself looking up words less, but still have no clue if that maps to speed, or whether that matters to me beyond the speed that should come with experience.

Though I will point out that I typed this entire section---and a lot of the others---in stenotype, only looking up "whether," if that interests anyone.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

This week continues the overhaul to support a more practical format than CSON.

Mainly, we now have an end-to-end ability to convert a CSON note into the equivalent YAML-and-Markdown note. This happens from a menu item, only available for the right kind of note. In addition, a configuration option sets the default note type, to avoid dealing with new CSON files.

After that, while not done and may cause problems for a couple more days, the process has started on giving notes useful names. This project inherited files named after ID values, which makes it difficult to find anything without the application. More about it in the next section, but I have a plan for making the names useful that started with a shell function and a list of so-called stop-words, those words in a phrase that don't usually tell you anything, such as most prepositions, "the," or "one."

## Next

Expect to find more of the same, next week, as I finish the Markdown/naming code on Notoboto. Roughly, on every save, it should grab the title, down-case it, drop any stop-words, hyphenate what remains, maybe add a unique ID to prevent problems when someone (me) gives two notes the same title, save the file to the old name, and rename to the new. That should minimize the chances of Losing a file or not cleaning up old work.

And, since I currently work on a tiny screen, I want to move controls for some of the user interface buttons up to the (otherwise unused) menu.

I'd also like to at least test out the Framework laptop to see if I can move over there; I didn't get to it, this week, with other obligations and distractions. And who knows what other servers I might get running on one Raspberry Pi or the other?
