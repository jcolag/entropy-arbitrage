This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to **floodlight up. liquid god**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **floodlight up. liquid god**
 * Location:  <https://botflymother.bandcamp.com/album/floodlight-up-liquid-god>
 * Released:  2023
 * License:  CC BY (or public domain)
 * Creator:  [Botfly Mother](https://botflymother.bandcamp.com/)
 * Medium:  Music album
 * Length:  Approximately eleven minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Frequent references to death and succumbing to it

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## floodlight up. liquid god

The band describes itself as follows.

 > the bleeding edge of tranarcho-pop.

And despite the CC BY license marked on the album, they also say this.

 >  all songs (except *a song for em*, who i wrote the song with) and all recordings by botfly mother. released into the public domain. no rights reserved. copyright is illegitimate. (ignore the funny little link below)

Still, credit them anyway, because we should *always* credit the source of art, even if the artists say that they don't care.  You do that for the audience, more than the artist, because they'll want to know where to get more of what they like.

## What Works Well?

As usual, tastes will differ, here, but despite the short run, here, it almost makes more sense to think of this album as a single, continuous work, rather than a series of songs.  Despite changing metaphors and ubiquitous mentions of death, the songs suggest a deliberate arc to them, crawling out of a deep depression, from a desire for death to acceptance of bad circumstances and seeing the potential for a better life out there, with the final visit to the moth suggesting that they haven't really learned the lesson that they should have.

I'd also point out that we have some lines that...I don't know, maybe they'll resonate in the current environment.

 > It's OK, I think that we are gonna make it through,
 >
 > not unscathed, and not all the way.
 >
 > What else can you do?

And really, we *don't* have options other than surviving.  The implied alternative only passes the problems on.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Again, this comes down to taste, but a lot of the lyrics often feel like they only want to describe a situation plainly, with any prosody or rhyming treated like it might have happened accidentally, along with the music.  And I can see the role of such a thing in music in general, but it doesn't feel like it fits with the darker themes, here.

Also, this has less to do with the album than the presentation on Bandcamp, but it feels like necessary politesse to warn prospective listeners and customers that about half the songs revolve around the protagonist actively and openly pining for death.

## Opportunities

You can buy the album (plus an earlier one) on Bandcamp, and the page has a sparse "Community" tab.

## What's Adaptable?

The moth surely has some narrative uses elsewhere, no...?

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll play **Speciare Lunar Research Facility**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
