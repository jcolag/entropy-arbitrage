This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads two stories from **The Aether Age Codex:  Helios**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Aether Age Codex:  Helios

The editors describe the anthology as follows, at the start of their note.

 > Welcome to the first volume of the Aether Age Codex, which we have labeled **Helios**. Discover tales of a humanity given a single prime to the pump of progress as they stare into a sky that in a blink of History has burgeoned into life and mystery. Given the antecedents, is it any wonder that they take flight in airships, balloons, as winged hoplites, and aboard wooden rockets, even as Athenian philosophers argued over the very laws of nature?
 >
 > After careful study of the available materials, we conclude the familiar human drive to learn and to teach is as much responsible for the dramatic divergence of this history from our own, as the wondrous and strange nature of their physical world.
 >
 > During an era when our own civilizations labored in illiteracy and when major technological innovations were separated by centuries, the people of the Aether Age Codex progressed at an astonishing speed. Ideas spread across borders and seas. Science, invention, and industry proceeded at a pace only recently seen in our own world.
 >
 > Despite the spectacular circumstances and drama, these are accounts of people contending with the unknown through bravery, fear, and the entire emotional spectrum. In that sense, these windows into the Aether Age open into a world as familiar as it is unexpected.

I've heard other people describe it more tersely as "[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk), but less [WASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestants)-y."

I should note that, starting with the **Helios** posts, the Book Club plans to at least bend one of my guidelines for these posts, for I think justifiable reasons.  Normally, I try to avoid going back to the same source and involvement by the same creator, at least until we have exhausted the available authors; I want to spread the attention, not keep reminding you of the same handful of people.

However, Brandon H. Bell edited this anthology---along with Christopher Fletcher---and also edited a Free Culture anthology *periodical* at around the same time.  As such, to spread attention to more people, expect to see Bell's name come up disproportionately, as we talk about the short stories in *that* anthology at some point.

As another note, it appears that supplemental content for the book has vanished from the Internet, assuming that its creators ever released it.  The editorial remarks mention audio adaptations of some stories, possible dramatizations, and a soundtrack.  Sadly, I can't even find evidence of much of it.  An episode of the long-defunct [Outer Alliance Podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20110823215320/http://outeralliance.podbean.com/2010/12/17/outer-alliance-podcast-2/) included an excerpt of one of the later stories in the book, but I can't find the recording.  Somebody took down the book's trailer video, which apparently included music from the soundtrack.  And maybe that feels appropriate for a book that calls itself a translation of a fragmentary text that arrived from another timeline...

### Technology (and Capitalism) Note

Many of you will feel put off by the fact that you can only get the book, at least for the moment, at Amazon.  I don't blame you, because I had the same twinge when I bought it, ultimately relenting because I needed to buy something else there anyway.  As always, I won't post a copy of the book to get around this, since that would encourage people to avoid supporting the project[^1].  Some good news does exist, however.

[^1]:  I will see if I can find and contact the editors, though.  If the age and discount means that they no longer really care about monitoring sales or the money, then I'll dump my PDF somewhere.

First, a lot like [**Occupy This Novel**]({% post_url 2021-10-23-occupy1 %}), the book has no [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) on it, so once you buy it and navigate through Amazon's user interface maze to download it, you can convert the book to something sensible, like the PDF that I read from.

Second, you can borrow the book through the Internet Archive, if you absolutely refuse to engage with Amazon or spend the dollar on (so far) a fairly good book and don't know somebody who might share their copy with you.

## What Works Well?

While frustratingly exposition-heavy, *Goga's First Law* does provide a lot of information on the world, for those interested in working with this setting.  More to the point, in contrast to something that I'll talk about later, it all feels true to the setting.

Also, the main characters---Goga and Henku---feel like they make some sense, and their adventures could prove entertaining.  They have actual personalities and motivations, rather than characters who we've seen who seem to mostly do what the plot needs of them.

And similarly, both stories do a good job of introducing the characters' situation and escalating the tension.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

We have some awful stereotyping of the Japanese in *Goga's First Law*, specifically the following.

 > ...the Nihon always produced them with a taste of the artistic that made their ships look as though they could not survive a voyage into the aether.

This feels highly uncomfortable to me, a stereotype that, first, conflates art with engineering---consider that, when the Japanese have gone to war, everything looks far less "dainty," for example---for seemingly emasculating purposes, but also doesn't add anything to the description but racism.

Goga's entire character arc also sometimes feels nonsensical.  While the story mostly holds together as a concept, the character asks permission to build something to attack another ship, then "innocently" tinkers with a missile when denied that permission.  But when asked to mount an explosive on the missile, he balks, because he would never have any interest in attacking another ship.

*The Heart of Carnelian*, on the other hand, doesn't seem to understand its world, telling what feels more like a cyberpunk story than anything in this setting.  Much like, [last time]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %}), we had *The Flight of the Ibis* arbitrarily introduce magic into the mix, this gives us hand-guns, electrified staves, sonic grenades, hospitals, satellite telephones, and working artificial eyes, in the early days of this expansion of science and technology.  In a lot of ways, it feels like the author might have written this for some unrelated project, then shook in a handful of Egyptian-themed references in hopes that it would fit.

## Opportunities

I sincerely doubt it, other than buying the book from Amazon.  They published the book almost fifteen years ago and never---to my knowledge, but please somebody correct me, here---tried to build a community around the concept.

## What's Adaptable?

As mentioned, we get quite a bit of information on the mechanics of this setting.  But as to specifics, we don't get much more than a couple of characters and ship names.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading **The Aether Age Codex:  Helios** with the next three stories in the book, *The Birth of Hellas*, *The Arms of the World*, and *Advance Gratitude*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about these stories?
