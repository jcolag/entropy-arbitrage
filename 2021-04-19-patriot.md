Parts of the United States celebrate [Patriots' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots%27_Day), today, celebrating the anniversary of the first battles of the American Revolution and---on a more global scale---sparking the [Atlantic Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions).

I don't go in for nationalistic holidays, but I think this one can be justified.

Anyway...

## Doritís Onomáton

This is shaping up.  I tried to find a better sliding tile, but experiments didn't pan out, so I worked out a better workflow for the sliding, instead, and that'll have to be fine, for now.

I also added alphabets, generalizing the code so that they can be added easily.  In addition, diacritical marks are now optional, based on a menu option.

Finally, the menu can also show a basic *About* dialog box.

## Next

I'll probably add alphabets this week, and clean up the About box, which I think completes the basic functionality.

The next step would be to set up a server to catch the saved names.

At that point...I guess I start figuring out the process of submitting this to the app stores?
