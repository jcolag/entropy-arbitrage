This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Aumyr**, from the introduction to the geography of *Zeitan*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Aumyr**
 * Location:  <https://www.aumyr.world/en/>, <https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting>
 * Released:  2019 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Marco Bertolini](https://github.com/bertolinimarco)
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately sixty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Standard fantasy tropes, suggestion of a natural disaster leading to a refugee crisis in the past, weapons.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aumyr

The website describes the project as follows.

 > Aumyr is a fantasy setting for role-playing games, born with the aim of being free, adaptable and ready to be played. It can accommodate many types of systems (d20™, Dungeons & Dragons®, Pathfinder®, Labyrinth Lord, etc...), provided they contain classic fantasy tropes as magic and wizards, elves, dragons, dwarves, warriors and so on. For a campaign set on Aumyr, use the basic rules for your favorite role-playing game. No value is provided typical of some systems such as Armor Class, Skill, Saving Throws, Difficulty Class or other mechanics, so that it is entirely entrusted to the narrator the ability to conduct the session independently.
 >
 > ### The world is yours
 >
 > In these pages you will find only some information about world history, deities and geography: it will be up to you to give life and color to everything else. Aumyr is designed to be used both by Masters who like to schedule their own game sessions, and for those who like to improvise and let themselves be guided by role-play. In the first case you will have several details on the setting, in the second it will be enough for the Master to take what he wants to start playing.

And it then goes on to detail more aspects of the world of Aumyr.

I should note that Bertolini wrote the book in Italian, which---like many languages---I haven't learned.  As such, I'll read this through machine translation, so the usual caveats apply that I may overlook clever turns of phrase or may not see connections that fit together in the original.  You can find a lot of the same material on the website translated to English and French, but because I want to follow a standard ordering---to know where to start and stop posts---and don't know how far the translations have progressed, I'll stick with the book.

## What Works Well?

I certainly can't fault the project's ambition.  I'll talk about this in more detail dealing with adaptable elements, but once the book finally starts rolling we have a forgotten ancient race leaving behind wild technology, an extensive timeline scattered around the book, multiple creation myths, a collection of artifacts, and four (so far; we still have a bunch coming) regions with governments, militaries, populations, religions, histories, districts, key locations, and tourist spots.

Also, while this might cut either way as we move forward, the structure---explicitly mentioned a few times in the early parts of the book---keep things fairly modular.  While designed to form a complete world, if you want to pick out the Native/Nativi people, the region of Valdarn, and a couple of artifacts, they don't have *much* tying them to the rest of the world's contents.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

While others may well differ in opinion, I found the first pages difficult to get through, for how often the text feels the need to tell us how exciting and mysterious we should find this new world.  While it doesn't really pan out that way, it does give a strong impression that those interesting parts probably won't come from the book.

Similarly, this takes a lot from the general culture of playing fantasy role-playing games, most prominently by referring to "Adventurers," as if people should write that on their hypothetical census and tax forms as an occupation.  Similarly, other than the quirky "Natives," we have the same Tolkinesque "races" with more or less the same traits that we could find anywhere.

## Opportunities

If you visit [Aumyr's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting), you'll find what looks like the entire book in HTML sections, where you can file issues and suggest changes like any other repository.  They also offer an open invitation to join the [Aumyr Discord server](https://discord.gg/HP9bA4Z).

You can also check them out on a number of platforms, including the [Aumyr-it Deviant Art Gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/aumyr-it), though I note that none of the images carries an explicit public license.

## What's Adaptable?

The Natives/Nativi seem to have the most background of the various populations.  Prior to them, we have the Askari and their assorted inventions and scientific/technological sites.

We have the "five adventurers" who may have populated the world from across the multiverse and ascended to god-like status worshiped by the majority of people, and the smaller pantheon of the Natives.

The book also lists plenty of imposing artifacts of various sorts, with extensive descriptions.  And so far, we have four large regions of the Aumyr continent, including an ancient magical prison and its Guardians.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading the background for **Aumyr**, from the geography of Laentas to the geography of Inkari.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the world?
