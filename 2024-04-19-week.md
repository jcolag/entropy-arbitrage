As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...a more effective approach is to alternate boring tasks with meaningful ones. This helps prevent the effects of boredom from spilling over into subsequent tasks.

Mind you, this method assumes that you have enough meaning in your job to alternate, and I know from personal and shared experience that not everyone has that luxury...

 > The UAW has lodged a complaint with the NLRB, naturally. But the UAW has also filed a complaint with BAFA, the German regulator in charge of the Supply Chain Act, seeking penalties against Mercedes-Benz Group AG.

Hashtags:  #Labor #Capitalism

I find it interesting that this premise *only* really cuts in one direction.  When businesses organize internationally, is leaves them vulnerable.  When workers organize internationally, it also makes the businesses, rather than the workers, vulnerable.  Without governments going to bat for companies internationally---in the form of myopic trade-partner treaties---corporate money doesn't really buy them much.  Boohoo, right...?

 > The researchers found what they described as a significant reduction in participants‚Äô ‚Äúanger experience‚Äù when they disposed of the feelings paper.

Hashtags:  #Emotions #Health

I've actually tried things like this, over the years, and at least in my not-at-all rigorous experience, the disposal doesn't necessarily help---assuming that you have the process in mind---as long as you believe that you've had your say.  In other words, journaling probably works about as well, provided that you don't constantly go back to ruminate on your anger.

 > A modest 5 percent tax on all wealth above $1 billion would raise more than $244 billion this year alone. And that‚Äôs likely an underestimate, since some billionaires keep their wealth concealed from Forbes.

We, as a society, don't talk about the well-documented correlation between economic equality and political stability *nearly* enough.

Funny how we treat certain people---especially in professions with a traditional gender bias---terribly, as capital disassembles their entire industry, and then we wonder why they switch careers...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The Supreme Court held a hearing to consider the constitutionality of laws passed by Texas and Florida in 2022. The Court is presently deciding whether the laws in question infringe on First Amendment rights by prohibiting website operators from banning users or removing content based on the political viewpoints of these users‚Äîin other words, by compelling website operators to host online speech and content.

It amazes me how much work Wikimedia does to keep the Internet working as expected, while the Internet Archive gets all the press for mostly only arguing against copyright.
