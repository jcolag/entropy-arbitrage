## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Firstborn

Since our last post---following almost immediately from [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}), in fact---the **DS9** crew investigates rumors quickly spreading that Federation colonists now living in Cardassian space may not have accepted the political situation, in *The Maquis*, part I.

In this episode, though, we'll spend a *lot* of time with Klingons, so don't expect too much...

 > **ALEXANDER**: I'm sorry. We made fullerenes in chemistry class today and filled them with water.

I don't think that they actually made actual [fullerenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene), given that sixty carbon atoms (and nothing else) doesn't actually give you a soccer ball; it gives you a large molecule, which fits into crystals, as you can see in the [buckminsterfullerene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene) article.  I can believe that they made [truncated icosahedrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron) *modeling* sixty-carbon fullerenes loosely inspired by the work of [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), but not actual fullerenes.

This seems bizarre, because they definitely did some research, here, for a form of carbon only discovered less than a decade before.  For example, the lavender color comes from the color of dilute fullerene solutions.

 > **WORF**: You may not care about it now, but someday you might.

Last time, the pressure that Federation parents put on their children came to a head in [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}), but I have to admit that having children make career decisions before they turn thirteen feels like a few steps further...

 > **PICARD**: As a result, we won't be able to rendezvous with the *Kearsarge* for another four days.

The United States Navy has had multiple ships by the same name, the original specifically named for the [New Hampshire mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kearsarge_%28Merrimack_County,_New_Hampshire%29).

 > **PICARD**: Yes. And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiet time, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. There are some ancient ruins that are just being excavated.

We have seen that, in the aftermath of previous trips to archaeological sites, he usually brings home some important artifacts, so we can probably assume that he'll spend most of this episode pillaging some cultural heritage that he doesn't care about...

 > **PICARD**: We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targeting system. Mister Worf?

Worf may have zoned out because they literally upgraded the weapons in [*Genesis*]({% post_url 2025-10-02-genesis %}), two episodes ago.  Do they ever *not* want to shoot things?

 > **PICARD**: Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with you for a moment? I noticed several times during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted.

How does he expect people to pay attention when he rambles on about how he'll abandon his post for a few days to go play an Indiana Jones villain?

 > **PICARD**: But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take part in that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich cultural heritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival.

For the record, Picard pushed Worf out of his job, so that Alexander will grow up wanting to kill things.

 > **WORF**: It is the tyrant Molor. He was so strong no one could stand against him.

Not the line itself, but while speaking the line Worf passes street food that he recoils from, once again going to the "everybody feels disgust at foreign food" well.

 > **CRUSHER**: What's he saying?

They really do insist that every alien learn English around them.

 > **K'MTAR**: Ni'tokor bak'to! Q'apla, Worf. You are too much for them.

If you recognize---or have recognized, since he has prominently skulked around the street fair---our buddy, here, [James Sloyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sloyan) plays him, last appearing in [*The Defector*]({% post_url 2023-07-06-defector %}).

 > **K'MTAR**: We have other evidence that indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa and B'Etor, were behind the attack.

And you presumably remember them from [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-02-redemption %}).

 > **WORF**: Why did you treat Commander Riker so disrespectfully? You were rude.

Riker doesn't exactly model politeness either, mind you.

 > **ALEXANDER**: Yeah. She died when I was little.

Specifically, that happened in [*Reunion*]({% post_url 2023-12-21-reunion %}).

 > **RIKER**: You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Those vouchers are only good at your bar.

His whining about the validity of his winnings, not to mention the implication that he somehow broke the bank with his implausible luck, leads me to think that *maybe* he didn't play fairly.

 > **QUARK**: They learned of a magnesite deposit on the Kalla system. It belongs to the Pakleds, but those fools don't even know it's there. Your...err, friends tried to get at it.

We met the repulsive caricatures of people with intellectually disabilities in [*Samaritan Snare*]({% post_url 2023-03-16-samaritan-snare %}).

 > **RIKER**: Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again in a few days, and I wouldn't be in as good a mood.

It certainly sounds like Riker's back-up plan involves violence, because---ha---who cares about some foreigner?

 > **K'MTAR**: Listen to me, Alexander. When a human looks at you, he does not see himself. He sees a Klingon.

This returns us to the idea that the Federation doesn't make non-humans feel welcome.  For all the rhetoric that we get from characters representing the majority that the Federation embraces everybody, the people outside the majority consistently feel and express something different.  And the reveal at the end of the episode suggests that they don't fix it anytime soon.

 > **YOG**: I am Yog. Why are we speaking?

While difficult to spot him underneath the prosthetics and goofy voice, you *might* recognize Yog as [Joel Swetow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Swetow), who got his start at around this time---relevant to us---previously playing a Cardassian in the **Deep Space Nine** pilot.

 > **TROI**: You're up to something.

How clever of her to realize that he doesn't *actually* want to buy ore... {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **WORF**: No. Who knows what the future will be now that you have disrupted time? I may die tomorrow or I may outlive you. But when I die, I would like an honorable death. And the only way that is possible is for you accept yourself as you are, and stay true to what you believe. The cause of peace is a just cause. The struggle must continue.

I do find it interesting that Worf always seems to have the strongest commitment to peace out of this crew.  He slips occasionally, especially when Romulans (or Q) get involved, but everybody else tends more towards a [peace through strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_through_strength) philosophy than anything where you might care about people and accept them.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, since the episode focuses on plot, we don't get much out of this.

### The Bad

While technically related to the Klingons, we continue seeing parents pressuring children to already map out their careers.

Picard continues to believe that he can wander in and out of important archaeological sites.

Violence still stands as a high priority, with down-time consistently going to improving their weapons.  Picard, at least, quickly gets behind the alleged need to turn Alexander into a warrior.  And Riker strongly implies that he'd commit violence against somebody who doesn't have the information that he wants.

We see more evidence of racism, too.  Humans completely dismiss foreign foods as repulsive.  And despite the (alleged) translation devices, nobody can understand spoken Klingon.  Likewise, people judge foreign etiquette by human standards, but don't seem to judge humans at all.  And maybe most importantly, future-Alexander repeats the assessment that we've heard before, of humans in the Federation seeing non-humans as perpetual outsiders who have no chance of joining the mainstream.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the show throws another secret family member (or does it?) at us, in *Bloodlines*.
