As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I have always mildly regretted not actively calling on random students to speak in class, back in the days when [I still taught]({% post_url 2020-01-19-teaching %}).  I organized the tests in such a way that didn't favor "male-coded" traits---avoiding questions where one might memorize the class of answers, or rely on some flash of insight, for quick examples---and most women generally performed extremely well on them.  However, a high grade doesn't manifest in the classroom, where the other students have the opportunity to see through the stereotypes.

 > Many conservatives have blasted Francis' emphasis instead on social justice issues such as the environment and the poor, while also branding as heretical his opening to letting divorced and civilly remarried Catholics receive the sacraments.

This feels like a good sign, to me.  The weak point in the conservative movement has always sat somewhere near the detail that the right-wing largely *despises* named, organized denominations, because they have consumed endless conspiracy theories about conflicting loyalties; for illustrations, see their fears about JFK's Catholic upbringing, Obama's "secret Muslim" background, and even Nancy Reagan's astrology obsession.  They *tolerate* the alliance, because their goals sometimes coincide, and they like the ability to use Christianity as a shield for their ludicrous philosophies.  But this removes the shield and forces Catholics to make a choice between "allies" waiting for an opportunity to sell us out and the (legitimate) values that they claim to espouse.

In my (figurative) backyard, we have the example that [Robert Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) apparently lowered bridges on major roads and reduced parking at our parks for large vehicles, all to decrease the chances of public transit dropping off non-white people.  We all hear versions of this, growing up, yet somehow, nobody ever fixes the problem, thus perpetuating over decades.

Argh.

Seriously, I don't have anything useful to say, here.  Can we maybe stop this?  Those of you committing hate crimes (assuming that you somehow read my blog) have to realize that you come off like complete losers, here...

The gloom and doom aspects of this article highlight, at least to me, the fact that the author fails to mention that it took *forever* for this policy to make it into the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window).  Yes, it'll take time for the prices to move through the system.  Yes, companies will happily waste money fighting this in court if it deprives the government of even one penny that we could use to regulate them.  But also, if we had started this process as part of the Affordable Care Act where it belonged, those years and court cases would have already passed.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The studies show that vertically differentiated firms leverage the perception of "high-quality" to pay their employees less. Conversely, horizontally differentiated firms pursue jobseekers that reflect the distinctiveness of the brand and, for them, are willing to pay more.

I've always had this sense in the software industry, where students (up until recently) actively dreamed of "landing a job" with one of the Big Four software companies (Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta/Facebook), despite the fact that you get a job there by...applying and interviewing, pretty much like anywhere else.  And as a result, those companies treat many of those employees terribly.
