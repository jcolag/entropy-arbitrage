As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I'll grant you that I have always woken up early, so this never affected me.  But seriously, if we have evidence that students in general can do better if we make minor changes to policy, then either it makes sense to change the policy or we need to admit that we don't actually have a goal of helping students succeed.

 > Congress never lifted the ban on speaking fees or gave the justices a major raise. But in the years that followed, as ProPublica has reported, Thomas accepted a stream of gifts from friends and acquaintances that appears to be unparalleled in the modern history of the Supreme Court.

Due to pensions, I used to say that elected officials, when they leave office, should get taxed somewhere well over one hundred percent of all earnings above their successors' salaries, to prevent them from using their connections to clear the way for corporate overreach.  While I realize that comes off as heavy-handed, Thomas makes it readily apparent that public service does need to have *some* sort of duty beyond showing up.

I realize that everything about this situation touches a serious nerve with a lot of people, but "never again" only works if it applies equally to everyone and prevents pro-Holocaust politicians from gaining support.

These systems can't identify Black people as human, a significant part of the time.  Do we *really* trust them to tell us anything about the people who they *can* identify?

By now, you all know that I can't pass up a story like this, right?

If you want to check out the music in question, I followed links to links to yet more links to find two songs posted to [Jashnan's YouTube <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> page](https://www.youtube.com/@jashnan).  If you have some familiarity with music from and adapted from neighboring regions, you'll especially appreciate that blend of sounds and motifs.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > I think instance admins wanting to protect their communities, and community members not wanting to see anything from Threads, is a totally fair position. The promise of the Fediverse is that individuals ought to be in charge of who and what they see on the network.

I appreciate this clear-headed analysis of the issues involved with Meta's ActivityPub experiments.  Too many people have made up their minds on no evidence.

## Follow Me

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
