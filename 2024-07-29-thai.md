Today, we---but mostly Thailand---celebrate [Thai Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language), commemorating King Bhumibol's public discourse with the Thai Language Club of the Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University in 1962.  You know that I like a language day.

If you don't, then today also marks [International Tiger Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tiger_Day), bringing awareness to conservation efforts.  And I found better pictures of tigers than I could have of Thai writing, so guess who gets the header image slot...

And on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the third.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the sixth of August.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For July, I wrote a piece on the weirdness of a certain kind of supernatural fiction that almost became a post, discussed media consumption skewed slightly towards celebrating Disability Pride Month, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage %}

The good news?  I finished propagating the "What do we mean by *less well*?"  Posts going back to [**Orang-U**]({% post_url 2020-05-09-orangu %}) now clarify that I mean the section to describe the work that *somebody could do* on the project, rather than criticizing the creators.  It actually bothers me that it didn't occur to me to do this far earlier, given that a non-negligible number of creators have kindly contacted me---you can see the majority of them in comments on the relevant posts, though one or two privately did so---offering their intents or expanding on what they wish they had done.

The bad news?  I started adding Tables of Contents to old posts, hoping to make navigation easier.  As of yesterday, I have only worked month-by-month, back as far as last December so far, but I'd expect that to accelerate as I test ways to automate the process starting with small batches.

## Fictopedia

{% codeberg jcolag/fictopedia %}

Much like touching up the old blog posts, Fictopedia now has corrected links and licensing blurbs for all pages through those starting with the letter *R*.  Soon, it should actually make some sense to point people to arbitrary pages that might interest them.

However, this has some non-great news, too, in that I've started to notice that the original Fictopedia community didn't always manage this well.  As a result, several pages miss category markers that they almost certainly should have, most visibly with the assorted fruit-themed poetry.  In all honesty, I don't know how I want to handle it, because it bothers me that people will have significantly more difficulty navigating the pages than they should, *but* I also don't want to accidentally make myself responsible for the contents of the archive by changing things that I see not working[^1].

[^1]:  If I took the step of making part of the archive what *I* would have done with the pages, then I'd feel strongly compelled to delete the many **ZRPG** planning pages---all of them empty or nearly so---get rid of the duplicate categories for individual solar systems that never have less in them than the superset category, and so forth.  At that point, it no longer works as an archive and becomes my derivative work based on the original wiki.

That said, if anybody *else* would like to file a pull request on Codeberg adding those references---adding the link to the category on the page, then the link back to the page from the category page---I envision fewer problems with that process.  I mean, I'll already presumably need to accept pull requests, if anybody has more pages squirreled away somewhere.

## Next

Expect the steady updates to the blog posts and Fictopedia to continue.  If I finish updating the blog posts, then I have another quality-of-life-type of addition to the blog's code that I hadn't realized that I could do entirely in CSS until recently; the ambitious of you can find hints of it commented out of the blog's CSS, as I've run those experiments and tried to work out exactly what I need.  Fictopedia also has some small adjustments to come, once I finish cleaning up the links.
