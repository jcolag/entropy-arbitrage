* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Every once in a while, I grumble about the prospect of writing a blog post.  It feels necessary to write, but I feel like I have said most of it already, and while repetition of form gives a blog entry points into what passes for a community, repetition of content often feels either lazy or like filler in the absence of a "real" idea or story.  And sometimes, that delays a Sunday post dramatically[^ssoeMq].

[^ssoeMq]:  Sometimes it even takes until the next week.  I really wanted to get this out *last* week, but couldn't pull it together in time, with everything else that I had to take care of.

![A small truck plowing heavy snow](/blog/assets/jacob-coffin-snowplow.png "I certainly didn't want a picture of the other kind of ICE around here...")

Anyway, I think this way when I read, especially when the writer has some fame or power.  While I won't name names, yes, I read somebody---who you probably read, too, if you read here---who has published pretty much the same post at least half the days of the last three weeks, but seemingly written from scratch every time, as if suddenly realizing this idea actually pushed for decades.  It feels awkward and alienating to read, even if I agree with most of the sentiment, so I try not to write that way.  My blog (probably) won't go anywhere anytime soon[^1bXNR6], so if you wanted to know my thoughts on one of those older topics, you *could* read the old post, making another post seem like a waste when I could talk about anything else.

[^1bXNR6]:  This has nothing to do with the post, but because I like redundancies:  Even if I vanish and stop paying the bills on domain names and servers, the Internet Archive crawls the blog at least monthly, and I push the latest Markdown source to three separate git hosting services.  Archive Today may also have some coverage, though their anti-bot measures preclude it from crawling except when a human requests a specific page.  The site analytics have shown a few amateur attempts at scraping the blog over the years.  And I have no idea how many people might have cloned the post repository from one of the services.  In that way, I have even secured the material from even my own interference.  If I say something horrible, for example, then I need to answer for that instead of quietly covering it up.

{% cw As you might have guessed from the post's title, this post deals with (ahem) "law enforcement" in the United States.  If you might need to put off reading it or need to prepare yourself, I'd recommend doing so. %}

{% cw Also, at times, links to other sites will come in rapid succession, and because up-to-date news requires resources, not many outlets have released appropriate articles under Free Culture licenses. %}

And yet...

## Background

First, let's talk about the history.

### Minnesota

Starting about two months ago, the Trump administration launched [Operation Metro Surge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Metro_Surge)---which sounds more like a 1990s snack brand aimed at disaffected teens than an enforcement operation, but let's roll with it---looking a heck of a lot like an invasion of a major United States city (and then the entire state) to hunt for Somali Americans, because somebody feels threatened by Ilhan Omar not liking him.  This activity has continued, with the ICE (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement) agents extrajudicially executing [Renee Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good) and [Alex Pretti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Alex_Pretti)[^Yoi7dr] this month, leading people across the United States to actually pay some attention, for once, now that they can envision this violence turned against *them* instead of victims who they can blame for living in the country without governmental permission or looking like maybe they did.

[^Yoi7dr]:  Yes, I know.  I'll get to the others and explain why I started with these two cases.

Alongside this, ICE has advertised heavily, with a marketing campaign often relying on [outright racist jingoism](https://www.cbc.ca/news/ice-recruiting-9.7058294), while they keep trimming back the requirements to join and offering massive bonuses (with obscured strings attached) to new recruits.  They apparently also have a low-end Large Language Model managing the application process, leading to [people accidentally getting jobs](https://www.slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-recruitment-minneapolis-shooting.html) without filling out the paperwork, passing their drug tests, or even accepting the offer.  Oops.  And we have started to see a spike in reports that, to absolutely nobody's surprise, overt [white supremacists have joined](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/2/20/headlines/texas_observer_links_ice_prosecutor_to_white_supremacist_social_media_account) in large numbers.

This has led to a lot of backlash, more than I expected[^DqYBOY].  A clear majority of Americans now see ICE as the wrong way to manage immigration.  People have begun (again) calling for the abolition of ICE.  And Minnesota staged two actual general strikes to protest this invasion over the past two Fridays. {% emoji clap %}

[^DqYBOY]:  And, the United States operating as it does, we also have plenty of backlash against the wrong people.  Yes, we have walked right back into the "our non-fascist elected officials should follow the vibe on social media and do exactly what we want, or we'll blame and punish them for the fascism.  Those who do try and fail, we'll also blame them.  But we won't blame the actual fascists, or take strategic measures to get them out of office."  That worked out *so* well for everybody in 2024, after all. {% emoji eyeroll %}

### Earlier Posts

Now, on the blog side, more than a thousand miles from Minneapolis, I also have a bit of history, here.

About five-and-a-half years ago---in Minneapolis, not far at all from where an ICE agent murdered Renee Good---a police officer murdered George Floyd.  I took that incident as an opportunity to educate myself about the history of such actions, and published what I learned in a post about [the nature of policing]({% post_url 2020-05-31-police %}).

Why bring that up?  Those incidents have more to do with each other than a law enforcement agent murdering an innocent---by law, we see every person accused of a crime as **innocent until proven guilty**, remember, and their deaths preclude any convictions to change that---person on the streets of the same neighborhood.  They both derive from the same philosophy of policing and the same structure.

Similarly, shortly before "Metro Surge," I warned against the obsession with [trying to exoticize hate]({% post_url 2025-11-30-locally-sourced-hate %}), because we have plenty of it at home.  Often, our hate *inspired* the examples that you might have on your mind, and we ignore that at our democracy's peril, because in addition to letting it fester, it also plays into the xenophobic idea that we need to maintain some 1400s-European vision of the United States.

![An ICE graphic posted to X on 2025 April 10, stating that, if it crosses the US border illegally, it's our job to STOP IT. It lists people, money, products, and ideas as examples](/blog/assets/ice-stop-at-border-740.png "Not listed:  Qatari jets, cryptocurrency to fund Republican campaigns, the Tate brothers...")

And let's not mince words.  Only about nine months ago, ICE posted to {% x %} about how they stop *ideas* at the border.  You might disagree on which ideas should get stopped, but identifying what you see as "Nazi stuff" makes ICE's case for it, even when you mean them.

## Getting to the Point

This brings us close to where we came in.  Part of me wants to gesture at those older posts emphatically, so that I can talk about something new, or maybe take a weekend off to think about other things[^McMzel].

[^McMzel]:  Had this gone out last weekend, I framed this in the context of the massive winter storm sweeping the United States.  My area made it through with "only" about a foot of loose snow with a layer of mixed precipitation on top.  A strip of the country, though, got a couple of inches of freezing rain, exactly the sort of situation that pulls down trees and power lines, right as temperatures dropped dramatically.  My sympathies go out to anybody affected by that.

OK, with the history out of the way, let's try to actually find something useful to say, here.

### Keep Paying Attention

First, if you finally noticed ICE because you saw white people in danger, I guess welcome aboard.  But can you start checking these things out *before* requiring video evidence that events might directly affect you?  You don't need anybody's formal permission to empathize with Black, Latine, Asian, transgender, or any other people.  They can't fine you for seeing yourself in them *even if* your skin color differs.

In addition to Good and Pretti, you might want to spare a thought to the people left behind by:

- Luis Gustavo Núñez Cáceres, died in custody at a hospital
- Geraldo Lunas Campos, a homicide victim in detention
- Víctor Manuel Díaz, "presumed suicide" in detention
- Parady La, pulled from drug withdrawal treatment
- Luis Beltrán Yáñez–Cruz, "from heart-related issues" in detention
- Heber Sánchez Domínguez, no explanation

Those eight deaths happened *last month*, not over years.  If you want to go back a few months to July 2025, then you can add at least three more executions, two vehicular collisions, one fall from a roof, and ten with little information who died in detention, among those who ICE reported.  That doesn't even get to the injuries, as agents have carefully taken their "non-lethal"[^AhiR5a] weapons to close range to inflict as much damage as possible to people.

[^AhiR5a]:  No such thing exists, as you can presumably guess.  The term refers to anything less likely to kill outright than firearms (with metal projectiles) and knives.

Seriously, I'll talk about other angles on this, but if you want to point to one single reason that we ended up in this position, it all starts here.  The fact that most white Americans---spurred by the media[^yBpr6l] picking and choosing its stories---have no interest in police violence or government overreach until the victim looks like them, gives that violence time to fester and grow bolder.  The Trump administration has so much power, because for two hundred fifty years, we have quietly agreed that the government can do whatever authoritarian and/or violent things that might interest it, as long as white people don't need to suffer from or think about it.

[^yBpr6l]:  I include so-called "independent media" in that, by the way.  Notice how they *absolutely* didn't care about the deaths of people with darker skin or non-Anglo-Saxon names, and most of them still don't, even if they diligently covered every change in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia cases.  Many have started trying to distinguish the two more famous victims by referring to them as "citizens," as if that makes their killings worse.

You can see it even if you go back a few paragraphs and only look at last month, January 2026.  At the start of the month, we watched Renee Good's execution.  And we saw an outburst of fear and anger at the time, and then...the story faded back into the background.  Throwing senior citizens outdoors in their underwear or arresting local children to use them as bait, those got a reaction, but not as much, probably because it didn't happen to a white person.  Even the six other deaths *this month* due to ICE operations don't even rate a mention, mostly, because the majority of their ancestors don't have roots in Europe.  The fear and outrage didn't start to stick until Alex Pretti's execution made Good's more than a one-time lapse.

We can't fix racism by pretending that race---a social construct around which we have structured much of society to preserve the higher status of white people from when white people could own slaves as a kind of livestock---but we can start fixing racism by at least giving a damn about people regardless of how white supremacists would treat them.  If we reserve our empathy for people who white supremacists would respect, you *do* understand what that makes us, right...?

### Policing in General

Next, I want to get back to that history of policing.  As you might already know or remember, modern policing generally traces back to a handful of inspirations or predecessors.

First, we have private security.  I don't mean any old private security, though, but rather people in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries patrolling docks to protect resources extracted from colonies and products to ship back.  Not only does this mire the concept in slavery---who do you think gathered those resources?---but it establishes the pattern that policing protects property from people, and that people pose a threat.

Then, proudly in most histories of policing, you have Robert Peel's [Royal Irish Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary), an arm of the occupation of Ireland tasked primarily with the suppression uprisings, and developed to free up the military to fight overseas.  They developed a series of [principles of policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles) to buy legitimacy in London, but you'll notice the two biggest principles inherent to the progression:  Policing quells dissent and does so because it would cost more---economically and politically---for the military to do it.

We then get to slave patrols in the United States, militias organized to monitor and discipline enslaved people.  This continues the themes of seeing humans as threats, putting down uprisings, and standing in for military occupation, which most people wouldn't accept.

Finally, we get the [Mounted Guards](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/history) and precursor organizations.  Starting in the twentieth century, a few dozen agents based in El Paso hunted Chinese immigrants along the United States-Mexico border, sometimes in cooperation with the Texas Rangers, having them do the actual policing.  Notice that Border Patrol itself celebrates looking for Chinese people to harass; I didn't make that assessment.

As I have pointed out before, other than the slave patrols, pro-policing organizations love to point to these predecessors as part of a tradition to take pride in.  The parts about protecting property, occupying conquered territory, and overtly enforcing white supremacy, they quietly hope that we won't notice, or that---in our [temporarily embarrassed millionaire](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/temporarily_embarrassed_millionaire) traditions---we'll notice and approve.

This gets to why I made a big deal about forces for hate originating domestically a while back.  People have an urge to talk about ICE using "gestapo tactics," but you can see a direct lineage between ICE and both slave patrols and, most directly, border patrol.  Blaming Nazis pretends that we don't have this problem central to our policing.

Seriously, do you think that ICE's predecessors enforced the overtly xenophobic [Alien and Sedition Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts) by politely asking worrisome people to please watch [**Þe Olde One-Room School Opera Buffa!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolhouse_Rock!)?

#### Bad Apples and the Like

Notice that this has nothing to do with individual officers.  The *job* does this, the role in society, not the individuals in those roles.  You could hire the kindest, most egalitarian people around to enforce laws, but due to the structure of the current system, you'll quickly get the same results.  When you build the system around white supremacy, treating humans as threats, and quelling dissent, then the system will do that, no matter who stands on the front lines.

Add in some so-called bad apples, and as the idiom goes, they'll *spoil the barrel*, corrupting every other officer, no matter their intentions, and apart from the organizational priorities.  And therefore, "good cops" get pressured both from the nature of the job and their less-ethical colleagues to serve authoritarian, white supremacist ends.

[ACAB](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ACAB), as they say, because the system demands it.

And by the way, when it comes to accountability, don't let the higher-ups fool you with their bad apples.  I already see people talking about how this *all* comes from Stephen Miller.  And...no.  Miller may have written some policy or other, and may have a significant amount of influence, but every single person in this administration supports and endorses these policies.  If some brave state arrests and convicts Miller, he has thousands lined up to take his place.  Any plan for accountability needs to get all of them.  More on that later.

### Bigger

The story doesn't end there, though.  As part of the "Global War on Terror," the United States created the [Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security) in 2002 and [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) in 2003.  At the time, people said "sounds like a fascist thing" and "don't we already have something like that," respectively.  But it capitalized on the fear of terrorist attacks on American soil to tie xenophobia to "national security," largely erasing the huge problems of domestic anti-government and anti-abortion violence from the security conversation, to say nothing of general bigoted violence.

From that perspective, it shouldn't come as a shock to see that this supercharged the protection of property from people, the white supremacist movement, and so forth, because anything shady by "one of them" could have served as part of some act of terrorism, providing ideal headlines to grab attention.  And anybody in power who openly saw this as a step too far, much like the racist definitions of crime a decade earlier, the country silenced.  Right-wing elements accused them of supporting terrorism---the new version of "soft on crime" from the prior decade---and voters dropped them, so it hasn't seen much real opposition since.

I'll bring this up again later, because it has a lot to do with how we might fix this, at least in my own opinion.

And again, I need to emphasize that we have too many people who only care now, because they watched a couple of white people die.  The (almost) quarter-century of ICE committing violence off-camera against non-white people, that apparently seemed fine.  The centuries of law enforcement acting the same way, that also seemed fine except for a few months five years ago.

## Where to Go

Well, I think that we learned from "Abolish the Police" that screaming "Abolish ICE" won't do any good.  That energy might last for a couple of months, yeah.  Then we'll get some high-profile arrests of foreign "terrorists," so that it feels politically harmful to say that we don't need *some* enforcement.  And ICE will start taking some care with white people, and politicians will all suddenly need to pivot to "oh, we'd never *abolish* any of this," because they fear our sentiment reverting more than they fear it staying the same or radicalizing further.

Mind you---in the spirit of full disclosure---I don't believe in enforcing borders at all, myself.  I believe in governments, and therefore *having* borders, because I have yet to find an alternative plan that maintains roads, keeps people up-to-date on vaccinations, and brings the wealthy to heel when they start trying to control people's lives[^LBNwKD].  But only the most bigoted fever-dreams even try to suggest a connection between people crossing that border with danger, *except* when taking advantage of different legal regimes, something that the wealthy generally do more of than refugees would.

[^LBNwKD]:  Yes, because of right-wing influence, governments have done a terrible job of those things.  It sounds pretty foolish to abandon the idea because the people who hate it sabotaged the implementation, doesn't it?  Let's get rid of chocolate, because this one (hypothetical) time, somebody put it on gefilte fish and nobody liked it...

I think that abolishing pretty much all traditional law enforcement organizations---and reimagining those few that we absolutely need, to create them from scratch without the baggage---should stay on the long-term agenda, then, but expect the current outrage to ebb quickly, given the lack of momentum.  As a longer project, though, we can start the process of discrediting the enforcement process.  That means remembering to treat every victim as innocent, not limiting that sympathy to citizens or white people.  Take the death of Delvin Francisco Rodriguez as seriously as the death of Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, and as seriously as that of Alex Pretti.  If your eyes glazed over at the first two names, fix that.  Sit with the feeling and interrogate where it comes from, instead of waiting for the next time when you feel directly threatened.

Stop buying into police-blotter journalism, especially around holidays, such as the evergreen fearmongering about "porch pirates."  Those stories exist entirely to sell you on the idea that we live in a country under siege, both so that you'll continue to consume the news (and, more importantly, pay attention to the ads in your stunned state), and so you'll support whatever powers that law enforcement might want.  Likewise, stop choosing convenience technology that you know shares your data with law enforcement to find other people; if you wouldn't report random activity outside your house, then don't use a doorbell that reports it on your behalf.

And I say this more as I get older, but explain your position to representatives, in forms that they need to deal with.  As I have said many times[^fwnq3], that means written them paper letters and meeting with them.  Stop it with the "if you don't do what I want, we'll primary you" nonsense that makes you a crank.  Position yourself as a resource, somebody who has educated yourself on the issue---also, educate yourself on the issue---and has a stake in the outcome.

[^fwnq3]:  I learned all this from Republicans, by the way.  They consistently contact all their representatives, no matter the party.  They want to encourage the right-wing to stay there, while encouraging everyone else to compromise.  Do you wonder why progressive candidates become more conservative as they stay in office, but conservative candidates stand fast?  Some lie to get into office, sure.  But mostly, it happens because *you* don't show up, but Republican voters do, making their case while giving a strong impression that your side doesn't care.

By the way, we all make fun of politician-speak like "as the father of daughters," but politicians use it because it works, and they think that way.  Introduce your point with whatever (true things only) makes you a resource or somebody worth listening to.  "As a constituent and donor" shows off your tiny amount of leverage over them without making threats, and I know people who make minimum donations to every campaign in the area exclusively so that they can identify themselves as donors.  Identity and career (small-business owner, veteran, second-generation immigrant, person with a disability, and so forth) show your value to the community, your needs, possible expertise in context, and most cynically, lets them mentally check the box that they spoke with your part of the community.  Social ties (family, educator, religious ties, clubs, etc.) indicate that you can sway others---another implied threat---while also showing your connection the community.

As I hinted before, this dampens the "soft on crime" effect.  In the 1990s, if a politician came out in favor of criminal justice reform, Republicans smeared them, and voters bought into the smear.  Every "establishment Democrat" survived that by compromising to stay in office, because as much as well-meaning (and ill-meaning) people want to think that their threats of "primarying them" instill fear, nobody loses an election in the United States for supporting the police unless they support specific corrupt police officers.  We probably can't change that.  But we can show increasing support for the opposite, making it politically *possible* to make either choice on these enforcement issues.

Finally, embrace "the lesser of two evils."  Quit your whiny "well, actually," game theory nonsense about how you can't bring yourself to vote for imperfect candidates.  You don't go hungry if you have run out of your favorite foods.  You haven't given up on corporate search engines as the companies scuttle their own results to push you to AI.  Let's not pretend that you play perfectionist games with your *own* quality of life, so maybe stop doing so with other people's lives, hoping that the rest of us will save you from your own apathy.  Voting for the lesser of two evils gives you---get this---less evil.

### More Immediately

And honestly, the short term looks a lot like the long term.  Capitalize on this outrage, and (politely, as an ally) pressure your representatives to do everything that they can to rein in ICE and DHS.  Claw back funding.  Impeach the public figures.  Finally pass laws that require accountability.  Everything.

Similarly, while I advised against personalizing these plans, "let's you and him fight" works *really* well---why do you think that the "go primary them" nonsense never leads to progressive policies?---especially when you have a coalition of diverse forces.  We have seen the fractures forming all year, starting with the various fights between Trump and Musk.  The Epstein files have worn a lot of them down, as their need to protect themselves has led them to alienate the supporters who they [conned into believing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) that Trump went into politics to expose the pedophilia ring of powerful people.  Cost of living has worn them down more, as Trump campaigned on affordability, now calling [high prices a hoax](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/nx-s1-5639957/trump-affordability-hoax-economy-midterms).  Oh, and we have [another batch of Epstein files](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/31/epstein-files-trump-howard-lutnick-steve-tisch.html), with more references to Trump, plus Musk, plus (Secretary of Commerce) Howard Lutnick, plus (Federal Reserve Board Chair nominee as of this week) Kevin Warsh, plus Steve Bannon[^oPVg83]; Epstein also pressured Democrats to back off from attacking Trump...plus plenty more redactions protecting perpetrators, and attempts to remove released files, raising new suspicions.

[^oPVg83]:  Bill Gates features, too, in maybe the most damning of the revelations, that he picked up an infection on the island that he passed on to his wife, and tried to find a way to cure it without her knowledge...presumably leading to their divorce.  That doesn't have anything to do with this post, since Gates doesn't quite fly in Trump's orbit, but I wanted to mention it for completeness.  And also, Gates has done some horrible things in his "liberal" aims, such as demanding that we enforce patents for COVID-19 vaccines despite treaties requiring that we don't, and his push for privatizing public education, so it shouldn't surprise anybody that he does terrible things in his personal life, too.

As such, now that the Alex Pretti execution has Republicans [blaming each other](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-miller-kristi-noem-minneapolis-b2909530.html), capitalize on it however you can.  That goes double, since the administration suddenly [opposes gun rights](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/2nd-amendment-advocates-issue-dire-warning-over-trumps-pretti-gun-remarks-00758740), yet another major faction of their coalition.  Amplify their fights.  Get your conservative friends (and representatives) to take sides.  We already saw that Marjorie Taylor Greene couldn't handle a few days of threats for taking a stand against Trump, and so she fled Congress entirely.  The rest of them won't hold out for much longer, if an actual feud breaks out.

And follow the Minnesota example.  They have spoiled the Trump narrative of a violent city with their non-violent resistance, not only making the administration look like petty warlords, but pressuring them to expose their endgame, [access to voter data](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/bondi-links-minneapolis-violence-voter-data).  By "crime" and "fraud," the losers mean that too many people vote against Trump for their tastes.  They *always* meant that.  When they talked about [government efficiency](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/23/nx-s1-5684185/doge-data-social-security-privacy), last year, we now know that they farmed out Social Security data to overturn election results that they didn't like.  When they use the word, "fraud" means that they have the sads that Trump lost the 2020 election.  "Waste" means that billionaires need to pay some taxes.  "Abuse" means that somebody other than a straight, white, cisgender man of wealth might get to exist in public, and they might need to see it.

I have said for a while, now, that we need to learn the lessons of COVID-19.  When people stopped going to work and shopping, Republicans scrambled to put money in everybody's hands to keep the economy going.  When people started shopping again, they wanted that money back, retroactively claiming that they actually meant to send *stimulus* checks, not relief checks.  And when that failed, they went to the CDC to shave down quarantine periods to a bare minimum of five days.  In other words, they told us *exactly* how long that their donors can accept a strike or a boycott before folding.

## Stay Safe

I could go on, but I think that I've rambled enough on this.  While the situation has gotten much worse---and I do hope that everybody can stay safe, because so many people sit in a more vulnerable position than I do---it also holds massive opportunities.  But it requires the political will to say that we want to do better than "go back to normal."

If we don't face down the systemic racism (and sexism), and our own ability to neatly compartmentalize violence based on the victim's race, then in 2031, we'll get to do this all over again, but something worse will have provoked it, maybe staged public executions or a replay of the [MOVE bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_MOVE_bombing).
