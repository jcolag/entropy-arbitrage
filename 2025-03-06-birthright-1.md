## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Birthright, part 1

Let's jump in...and probably jump right back out.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46578.4. The Enterprise has arrived at Station Deep Space Nine, to assist in the reconstruction of the Bajoran aqueduct systems damaged during the Cardassian occupation.

Since we made it (back) to the station, over on *DS9*, they would have recently fought off alien possession in *The Passenger*.

 > **WORF**: Delicious.

We've had the joke before that Worf likes "disgusting" food in [*Time Squared*]({% post_url 2023-02-16-time-squared %}).

 > **BASHIR**: Come in, come in. I need a hand with this field generator. See if you can boost the power output to sixty-five percent.

Part of me wishes that we would've gotten more of this quirkiness, here.  **DS9** introduced Bashir as abrasive in his naïveté, and a bit on the hyperactive side, so commandeering random parts of the *Enterprise* makes a lot of sense, and also contrasts with how the show's cast often does this for less-legitimate reasons...such as learning to dream.

Anyway, we'll talk about him a lot more starting in something like a year.

 > **SHREK**: Klingon. You are Starfleet, Klingon.

You might recognize random alien as [James Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cromwell), who we last saw in [*The Hunted*]({% post_url 2023-07-13-hunted %}), and will eventually star in **First Contact**.

 > **TROI**: Would you like to talk about what's bothering you, or would you like to break some more furniture?

She actually almost arguably...does her job, here.  She both respects Worf's situation, listens to him talk, validates his emotions, and nudges him to solving his problem.  I don't know how to handle this...

 > **BASHIR**: Your creator went to a lot of trouble to make you seem human. I find that fascinating.

It never occurred to me how much this scene feels like flirting, both in everything about someone seeming so fascinating and in its metatextual callback to Data's "fully functional" construction described in [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %})---and also Lois Lane in **Superman:  The Movie** censoring herself in asking "putting it delicately, do you...eat?"---which prompted me to wonder if Soong designed androids so that he could have sex with himself.

 > **PICARD**: Not at all. I'm here studying the intricacies of Bajoran aqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please, sit down.

How boring that sounds, as compared to his usual reading of people digging up archaeological sites without any context...

 > **PICARD**: Yes, you do. You're a culture of one, which is no less valid than a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding your experience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When we look at Michelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb, and we don't ask what does this mean to other people. The real question is, what does it mean to us? Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focus on it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you.

Or, rather, Data has a culture, because he lives in the Federation and has a rather specific career.  And I won't quote it, but I should note that, when Data reaches out, he reaches out to Worf, the ship's other token outsider.

Oh, and do I need to point you to the [*David*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_%28Michelangelo%29) statue?  The tomb seems original to the episode.

 > **BASHIR**: It sounds to me like you're talking about dreaming.
 >
 > **DATA**: An accurate analogy.

Also, Soong called it that in the vision, meaning that---once again---Data talks like this deliberately.

 > **BASHIR**: Thank you, Data. And sweet dreams.

I don't mean to alarm anybody, but did Bashir wear ballet slippers[^1] to the *Enterprise*...?

[^1]:  Yes, I know that they make booties for various production purposes, such as noise reduction and letting people trek across freshly painted sets.  The idea that Bashir stays ever-prepared for a highbrow dance-off, though, feels more satisfying...

 > **GI'RAL**: He must leave at once.

You might recognize the Klingon woman as character actor [Cristine Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristine_Rose).

## Conclusions

We don't get much out of this episode, to my chagrin, focused as it is on the personal experiences of two characters.

### The Good

After almost six years, we finally see something approaching legitimate therapy with the intent of helping someone.

### The Bad

Security seems so low that somebody can camp out in a medical office and take it over for unknown projects.

We continue to see that they find learning new topics boring and beneath them.  And Data continues to seem to affect his pedantic personality, as he uses overly technical language to prompt the use of a description that he already knew to use, in effect modeling his ethnicity.

Speaking of which, people seem to believe that their ethnicity defines their personal cultures, rather than the literal cultures that they live in.  Outsiders also don't feel comfortable speaking openly about their private issues.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we pick up Worf's story in (to absolutely nobody's surprise) *Birthright*, part 2.
