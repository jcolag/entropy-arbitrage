As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...fathers who said they had highly nurturing dads were much more likely to achieve their goals in a healthy manner, be more emotionally open and believe in equitable partnership.

Readers probably already know that I'm fairly resistant to talking about myself on the blog.  But for an additional data point, as terrible as my own father would become before I was ten years old, I do have to admit that he was nurturing for the first few years.  And while I certainly had a long, unpleasant stretch where I supported some extreme right-wing views, it looks like I may have at least had a better position to return to for those early years.

 > “Did we know we were lying about the drugs?” Erlichman asked. “Of course we did.”

This is the central problem whenever somebody tries to "improve" the War on Drugs:  It's doing exactly what it's *designed* to do.  We could solve far more problems with drug use by mailing people [naloxone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone)---which is literally as old as the War on Drugs, by the way---and similar overdose and addiction drugs than we ever could by paying to prosecute or incarcerate someone.

 > In a more hostile context, a gender-conservative context, men’s unemployment will leave a more negative psychological impact on the man, which reverberates within the couple.

I'm not going to search for it, but I'm certain that I've mentioned (probably just in passing) how right-wing groups, *especially* "Men's Rights Advocates," handle almost all their recruitment by talking about real issues such as this one, but then refusing to acknowledge the issues as a *symptom*.  That is, the right-wing solution to the problem presented in the article would be to guarantee jobs to men.

However, if you read the entire thing (or just think about it for a few seconds), since the stigma doesn't extend to gender/sexual minorities, unmarried men, or other non-traditional households, the solution is simpler:  Reject the idea of a single "breadwinner."  That's the solution, because the underlying problem is *misogyny*, generations of men conditioned to believe that they need to provide for "their" woman, as if she was a caged bird.

It's not exactly a critical story, but it's certainly an interesting story.

 > ...they can triple the albedo, sending more radiation back into space.

Roads just generally need to change.  It's possible to produce a seamless-looking road that's modular enough to easily replace sections that get damaged, include space for cables and pipes to pass underneath, won't soften in a heat wave, *and* can keep a city cooled down.  I'm sure that asphalt is probably cheaper per foot on its own, but a road can be doing a lot more work, which would make higher costs justifiable.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Let’s keep meetings virtual after Covid](https://knowablemagazine.org/article/food-environment/2021/lets-keep-meetings-virtual-after-covid) from Knowable Magazine

 > A recent poll of more than 900 readers of the journal Nature found that nearly three-quarters want scientific meetings to be all virtual, or at least to have a remote option, even after Covid is over.

Seriously, even when everybody is in the same building, virtual meetings free up floor space, avoid privileging the people who were able to physically attend, and are far easier to make accessible to attendees.  There are times when putting all the bodies into one room is useful, sure.  But those are special occasions, and the default *should* be to make everything a teleconferencing call.

That probably means giving employees separate offices, but since every study has shown that privacy boosts productivity, I don't see how that's a legitimate problem.
