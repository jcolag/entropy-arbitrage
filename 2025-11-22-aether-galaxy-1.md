This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading the **Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook**.

![A galaxy](/blog/assets/aether-galaxy.png "No, not too far away...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *Aether Galaxy*
 * Location:  <https://github.com/tfclarkdesigns/Aether-Galaxy>, <https://tfclarkdesigns.github.io/Aether-Galaxy/>
 * Released:  2025 --
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Terrance Clark
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately seventeen thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Effusive praise of a certain mainstream non-Free Culture franchise, references to violence, oppression, and war

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook

The repository describes itself as follows.

> Mythic space-opera setting released under CC BY 4.0. An open galaxy for writers, artists, GMs, and world-builders. "No canon, only coherence."
>
> ...
>
> Aether Galaxy takes place ages ago, in a far-distant galaxy of many advanced species. Civilization is shaped by two Great Powers—and by the ancient Orders that stand beside them.
>
> ...
>
> Nine thousand years have passed since the Commonwealth’s founding. The balance of the galaxy stands upon the edge of a blade. Without heroes, there can be no hope.

And now, other than that I discovered it because the creator occasionally posts to Mastodon under reasonable tags, you know pretty much what I do about the project.

## What Works Well?

Maybe most prominently, I appreciate the *no canon, only coherence* premise, inviting people to not only use the material and participate, but also to take the project itself out of the center:  Your version has as much validity as theirs.

And while I think that the text has a long way to go before it does it *well*, the project does accomplish its goals of creating something that could pass for---but differs sufficiently from---a certain gigantic media franchise.  It has the elements that you'd expect, plus a few, largely in prominence to how fans have thought about their inspirations for the past almost-fifty years.

## What Works...Less Well?

The preface kicks off by making this assertion.

> Space opera was once a shared language. It was a place where anyone could take part in the story. The early vision of the genre was built by many hands who believed they were adding their voices to a myth.

This seems like news to me.  I can't think of a single space opera project prior to this century "where anyone could take part in the story."  Even in the nineteenth century, the authors had no interest in common myth-making.  Maybe, overstating things a lot, they might mean *children* playing at home with mass market toys based on "the legendary story that American filmmaker and philanthropist George Lucas began in 1977," but that feels like a huge stretch, since I don't think that anybody considered (for example) me and my friends playing with action figures in the 1970s added voices to anything.  And in addition to that seeming dishonesty, suggesting a "fracture over vision, meaning, and even values" sounds like a "how dare they let *those people* into my franchise" kind of argument[^y1axQq], especially in a Free Culture work, regardless of the intent.

[^y1axQq]:  While I don't want to guess at intent, I will note that the structure, lacking the need for a rebel faction and having what sounds more like a Cold War between two superpowers, seems to lend itself more towards replicating (what we now call) **A New Hope** than **Andor**.

Some of this also feels extremely tedious enough to warrant editing.  For example, did we really need separate entries and descriptions of the various ranks of warrior-monk?  Surely, mentioning "apprentices, knights, and masters"---problematic connotations of that last term aside---carries about as much information as the sixty-odd words currently used to enumerate the kinds of Concord.  In quite a few cases, it felt like my eyes glazed over from the "five-paragraph essay" feel that it all has.

And while I suppose that it fits its inspirations, it still feels extremely jarring in 2025 to go through "the thing" where every "species" has a narrow description of their jobs and ideas, but crams in a lengthy essay about the adaptability and variability of humans.  It has colonial echoes of "they all look the same," but mostly reminds me of old fantasy role-playing games where this "race" can only have certain careers and moral codes, that one a different pairing, but humans?  They can do whatever they want.

The description of regions of space also strike me as confusing.  It describes the "Core" as the heart of civilization, which seems reasonable to the extent that inhabitants probably wouldn't describe it in any other way.  Then, the Inner Rim sounds like exclusive Commonwealth territory, but then the Middle and Outer Rims become places where the Commonwealth and Dominion regularly mix, which...does the Dominion travel freely through the Inner Rim?  Does it not have any representation in the Core?  Maybe Core and successive Rims don't have a concentric structure?  It seems like the sort of thing that should make its structure clear, but instead feels like a mess.

## Opportunities

The GitHub repository has seemed highly active since October, though with only one contributor so far.

## What's Adaptable?

The author composed the entire book from elements for reuse, really, but among the more interesting things to look for, I'd draw your attention to the card game *Snod*, the assorted intoxicants, and the dozen or so life-forms.

## Coming Attractions

Next up, we'll continue the material for the *Aether Galaxy* setting, with the remainder of the **Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook**, from *Gazetteer* to the end.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story?
