As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > He composed another song laced with ambiguous language and Kikuyu idioms to warn the Moi government of the discontentment and disillusionment among the general populace and Kikuyu in particular.

You can't really go wrong with protest music...

 > Nomadism is as much a scientific mode of living in the Nufud as industrialism is in Detroit or Manchester.

 > Only 0.5% of patients experienced a serious adverse event, also comparable to previously reported rates after in-person exams.

This becomes a far bigger deal as states feel empowered to restrict abortion rights.  It won't end well for them, but with "boots on the ground," states have the physical ability to prevent people from accessing abortions at another site, but they do *not* have the ability to interfere with the Internet or the mail.

 > People were feeling this thing that they weren't being asked about, that nobody was writing about, that nobody was researching. It just really felt like an unmet need.

I don't share this experience---for which I feel grateful, of course---but I have known people who deal with this sort of problem, so I welcome this research.

 > ...oil companies “are buying back their own shares, funneling dividends to their shareholders, and paying lobbyists to demand cheap new federal leases so they can stockpile them for future profit”...

I keep saying that moving to renewable energy has the great side effect of impacting the fortunes of the worst people on the planet.  Even if we don't care about carbon dioxide, we should care about stopping the profiteering fascists.

Especially after two years mostly stuck at home, we need to check on each other, and some of us need to re-learn what other people consider normal...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Amazon Is Bombarding Workers With Union-Busting Messages](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdpqj/amazon-is-bombarding-workers-with-union-busting-messages) from VICE Motherboard

 > The company has deployed a staggering amount of anti-union propaganda, bombarding workers with flyers, mailers, Instagram ads, Facebook posts, brochures, videos, phone calls, posters, mandatory meetings, a website, text messages, and notifications on Amazon’s AtoZ app, the platform its workers use for scheduling. The resounding message is “Vote No.”

At this point, I feel like I want Amazon workers to unionize across the board, specifically because they've been so offensively awful in trying to resist it...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Facebook's genocide filters are really, really bad](https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/23/false-genocide-negative/#metacrap) from Pluralistic

 > The human rights org Global Witness tried buying ads on Facebook for eight pro-genocide phrases that had been used during the 2017 genocide. Facebook accepted all eight ads, even though they duplicated the messages it promised it would block in the future...

Every time one of the big software companies gets an official pat on the back for promising to fix a problem, I like to quickly search for the number of times that they have *previously* received praise for promising the same thing.  They won't actually change their policies until governments *force* them to do so, because their current policies extract the biggest profits.  Facebook would openly support genocide, if they thought it would bring in a few extra dollars.
