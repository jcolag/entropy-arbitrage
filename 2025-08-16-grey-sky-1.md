* Ignore for ToC

This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads the first half (so far) of **Grey Sky**.

![The comic's title, surrounded by its main cast](/blog/assets/grey-sky-01-05.png "The spellchecker will almost certainly whine about the British spelling of the title, leading to resentment...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Grey Sky**
 * Location:  <https://greysky.neocities.org/>
 * Released:  2014 -- 2018, 2024 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Yabo "Yalyn" Vinkindo
 * Medium:  Web Comic
 * Length:  Approximately fifty page so far
 * Content Advisories:  Sexism, guns

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Grey Sky

The comic's *about* page describes it as follows.

> Grey Sky is a Free Culture webcomic series created by Yabo "Yalyn" Vinkindo.
>
> The webcomics are created with Free/Open Source software in Linux OS and is published in [Copyleft license.](https://greysky.neocities.org/copyleft)
>
> The first comic was published around June 1st 2014.
>
> It was put on hiatus on May 31st 2018.
>
> Around August 2024, webcomic project is slowly coming back from the dead.
>
> For further updates, go to [https://mastodon.art/@Yalyn](https://mastodon.art/@Yalyn)

I can confirm that the creator indeed posts updates to the Fediverse regularly, which has kept me anxious to see what the comic actually has to offer.

## What Works Well?

This comic seems like the only one who knows how to do the "make fun of annoying things in the medium by doing it" trope well.  You do it *up front*, to set the tone, and then leave it alone.

I also have to appreciate the work going into establishing the house.  You might not notice unless you check the credits between panels, but they decorated the house with art from Free Culture properties.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Some of this could probably use an edit.  I mean that both in how the dialogue doesn't always flow and how the earliest installments jump around so much that it doesn't seem like it will settle on a story.

Maybe this has to do with the apparent translation, maybe the rhythm of the comic, or personal taste, but the jokes all seem to fall flat for me, with some so opaque that I don't even know where I could identify the joke.

And the story seems to land on traditionalist gender roles uncomfortably often.  We see this most directly in the early episodes harping on our presumed protagonist getting "beat up by a girl," but also in the parameters of and interruptions to the relationship.

## Opportunities

The comic does have a [support](https://greysky.neocities.org/support.html) page, which includes the following.

> It's been a long time that I've denied donations. I've now open it back up if you really want to support me.
>
> However, please understand that I have a full-time job which means that my webcomic project can range from being slow to really slow.
>
> If possible, sharing my work, translating my work or maybe even sending a nice comment to me (via Mastodon) would be wonderful.
>
> But if you want to donate to me then I have [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Yalyn/) and [Ko-fi.](https://ko-fi.com/yalyn)

And then a bunch of other Free Culture projects, many of which have shown up or will show up in these posts.  And on that list, it would appear that I have the creator of this comic to thank for making [**Project Ballad**]({% post_url 2023-07-29-project-ballad-1 %}).

## What's Adaptable?

We don't really see it in action, but the world itself seems like the only prominent thing introduced, a place where odd weather, monsters, and paranormal abilities have become common enough for people to know about them.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll read **Grey Sky**, an ongoing comic.  It looks like enough material in (I believe) an ongoing story that we'll split it into two posts, covering fifty pages apiece.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
