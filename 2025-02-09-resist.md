* Ignore for ToC

Things in the United States have not, as you might guess from the headlines, improved.  We all know this.  We all know how this happened and who we should hold responsible.

{% cw I'll almost certainly link to stories in here without much regard for whether the author or outlet makes their work available under a Free license.  If you find that distinction important, then you probably don't want to click through.  Also, plenty of United States politics and resistance to current trends. %}

I don't want to---or need to---draw attention to the overwhelming majority of this.  As mentioned, you already know the story at least as well as I do, and many of you probably live it more intensely than I do, because they might have you in their crosshairs, whereas they might not necessarily care about me until I threaten them.

![A painting of Washington, DC, mostly blue with yellow structures/trees and a reflection](/blog/assets/15269344268_ca316e9f6f_o.png "I haven't gotten down to the city since junior high school, and recent events have not convinced me to do so any time soon...")

Instead, I want to talk about the (shockingly weak) *reaction* to this anti-democratic administration and their lackeys, and what we might do better.  Specifically, I want to make the point that a lot of so-called resistance has decided to play into what they claim to resist.  Some of this probably comes more from the media than individuals, but definitely not all of it.  Speaking of which...

## Corporate News Stinks

Let's not sugar-coat this.  The corporate media has no interest in democracy or even truth.  They care about their stock prices, which means that they care about how much they can charge to run ads, which means that they *only* care about keeping you in a constant state of anxiety or anger, so that you'll sit through the commercials to get to the rest of the story *and* feel worn-down enough that you might wonder if maybe you *do* need to jab yourself with appetite-suppressant drugs with a long list of possible side effects or bundle your insurance so that only one company controls your life.

For the twenty-four-hour television channels, they want you in an even worse state, because how else can they get you to watch more than the overview of headlines and justify the other twenty-three hours and forty-five minutes or whatever of broadcasting?

Meanwhile, they'll pay what amount to bribes to the administration to avoid prosecution.  They'll scuttle critical stories so that they don't lose their cushy seats in the White House Briefing Room so that they can transcribe any lies first.  And they'll fire anybody who the powerful don't personally like.

For your own sake, *drop them*.  Do it for your own health.  As a broader rule, when the news makes you angry or fearful---especially if they center people who make you feel threatened---ask yourself how often they do it, and whether they might have that as their business model; if they do, go elsewhere for your news.

Finding better media takes work, both because you need to do the legwork of finding and vetting them, and need to make sure that they don't only feed you what you want to hear.  But I assure you that you'll feel better if you limit your TV news to (for example) PBS's [News Hour](https://www.pbs.org/show/newshour/), which has its imperfections, but they (at least mostly) challenge lies, with a tone of voice that reflects our eye-rolling.

### Also Watch out for Social Media

I should mention that, trained by years of working with the algorithms on Facebook and {% x %}, many people mimic the behavior of corporate-owned news in their posts.  Because incendiary fearmongering could "go viral" on the big platforms because that increases "engagement," they assume that we should use *all* social media that way, and so they post the same garbage that got them attention on their prior platforms.

Many have adapted better to the newer platforms, but you have the hold-outs who can't wait to illustrate their posts with an ugly picture of some fascist looking angry or predatory.  Exactly like you should drop any media outlet that treats you like that, stop following *people* who treat you like that, too.

They may not know better, but they also waste your time by generating outrage instead of letting you focus on fixing things.  We'll get back to that idea, later.

## Place Blame Where It Belongs

As often happens in American politics, when Republicans do awful things, the people who vote for Democrats...blame Democrats for the problems.  And can we maybe *not* do that?

I get it.  Somebody famous said something about fighting to show that they fight.  Somebody else famous said that the Democrats should embrace Freedom Caucus-like tactics to make things worse.  Maybe somebody called them [quisling](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quisling)s, or circulated MLK's condemnation of the white liberal out of context[^1] again.

[^1]:  The full context comes from white people voting for small improvements while insisting that people living the worst of current policies keep out of the argument, not that liberalism has somehow failed.  Seriously, go read.  I'll wait here.

Except that fighting for show wastes energy.  When the opposition to fascism take their cues from fascists, then you have no alternatives to fascism.  And did you learn *absolutely nothing* from the people who couldn't square the "huge" moral dilemma of voting for Harris because of her presumed insufficiently progressive views?

Marci Wheeler, citing a recent Axios piece, makes the point that you want to [put pressure on the *Republicans* in power](https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/02/07/how-to-attempt-to-get-republicans-to-object/), not the people who can only impotently object.  And this feels like a corollary to an argument that comes up whenever somebody suggests writing their representatives:  Counter-intuitively, it matters *far more* that you contact the representatives who you disagree with than those who you do, because the latter won't affect policy...though also reach out to those you agree with, to keep them on track, but keep your focus on opposing the worse people.

Don't conflate this with not criticizing or not pressuring the minority party, by the way.  But insisting that "the Democrats don't fight for us" got Trump elected, so the idea that doubling down on this seems to benefit the fascists, not democracy, so maybe *don't* do that.  And yes, that includes [Bernie Sanders ranting about the party abandoning the working class](https://theconversation.com/bernie-sanders-says-the-left-has-lost-the-working-class-has-it-forgotten-how-to-speak-to-them-243160) even though the Biden/Harris administration not only supported unions, but [Biden himself walked a picket line](https://aflcio.org/2023/9/27/service-solidarity-spotlight-biden-becomes-first-president-walk-strike-picket-line-joins), the only person in his position to do so.

It also matters, by the way, that you contact (where applicable) levels of organization above and below, trying to recruit them to put pressure where you want it.  When you contact your Senator, for example, send a similar message to your Representative, governor, and state legislators.  When you contact somebody in the state, go for your Federal and municipal representatives, too.  And contact all their offices, with as much physical presence as you can muster, meetings better than letters, letters better than calls, calls better than e-mail, and so forth, and above all [*You Can't Post Your Way Out of Fascism*](https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/).  Anybody can figure out how to "lose" digital communications or overflow the storage so that nobody gets through, but they can't ignore somebody who shows up.

Repeat after me:  Democracy does not stop after an election.

Remember, they may fear retribution for doing the right thing, but every single politician fears doing something so unpopular that it sparks an uprising.  Despite his public racism, Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act.  Despite his, Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency, and established the country's first affirmative action plan.  They didn't do this because somebody rationally convinced them to do the right thing; they did so because they lived in fear of infuriating an engaged American population.  And sure enough, when we show them that we can *see* them, the scramble to back off.

## Memory, Not Surprise

Too often on social media, I see people posting shock and outrage that the Trump administration has done far worse than they ever imagined.

And, look, I try not to do the *how can you not know this?* thing, because it assumes that everybody comes from the same background, or that anybody who doesn't come from that background doesn't matter.  But also, in this case...*how can you not know this*?

No, seriously, Trump proxies literally published their plans as [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) that you can download for the price of a (bogus) name and e-mail address.  People recorded podcasts, wrote comics, and more, describing its contents and what that meant.  And Trump literally campaigned on all this.  To not know, at this point, can only happen by deliberately ignoring it.

Go fix that.  If you don't, then you look like the creeps eight years ago telling us that Republicans would *never* try to overturn [*Roe v Wade*]({% post_url 2022-05-15-roe %}), only to quietly vanish when the Supreme Court [did overturn it]({% post_url 2022-05-08-alito %}).

## Pick Your Terminology Wisely

I feel like everybody has made fun of it so often, that the media in particular tends to use Republican terms for everything, followed by Democrats, ultimately losing fights because everybody with authority chose to call anti-abortion terrorists "pro-Life."

And I already see that happening with this administration.  The [U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency) doesn't qualify as a [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments) in the governmental sense.  It doesn't care about government efficiency.  And "of," like other prepositions (and articles), never shows up in acronyms unless you've grown desperate.  But we treat people seriously when they call it DOGE, or try to find "funny" ways to pronounce it.

Instead, might I recommend "billionaires ransacking the government," no acronym?  The group's "chaotic" actions have a common thread, after all, of blocking regulatory action against their ringleader's companies.  USAID had an [investigation into Starlink's business in Ukraine](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-enemy-usaid-was-investigating-starlink-over-its-contracts-in-ukraine-2000559365), for example.  They plan to [restructure financial regulation](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-advisers-seek-shrink-or-eliminate-bank-regulators-wsj-reports-2024-12-13/) while [{% x %} pushes to get involved in payment processing](https://www.reuters.com/technology/x-seals-payments-deal-with-visa-push-toward-musks-everything-app-goal-source-2025-01-28/) and wants to hawk cryptocurrencies.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [aired some dirty laundry](https://www.wonkette.com/p/this-press-release-from-the-cfpb) about Tesla and {% x %} (and others) that might have come under their jurisdiction, when the group invaded them.  I could go on, but you get the general idea of what "government efficiency" means to them.

Likewise, why call Trump's plans an "America first agenda," when those plans openly seek to dismantle the government, will tank the economy, and give many countries huge opportunities to replace the country's influence[^2]?

[^2]:  The existence of these dingbats exposes the danger of our outsize influence over the world, and it would serve everybody better to have a more cooperative environment, but that goes off on a completely unrelated tangent.

And, you know, don't give up referring to President Musk.  Petty?  Sure.  But Trump wants the status of the Oval Office with none of the work, and depriving him of that status will cause more problems that weaker terms like "co-president" or whatever never will.  That seems especially interesting, given that [Musk started working with Boeing to create a new Air Force One](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-boeing-air-force-one-replacements.html), which sounds innocuous until you realize that he makes a [vehicle more dangerous than the Ford Pinto](https://fuelarc.com/evs/its-official-the-cybertruck-is-more-explosive-than-the-ford-pinto/) and [Boeing deliberately violates safety rules](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/01/boeing-boeing/#mrsa), making any schism between them a potential assassination attempt, assuming that everybody's carelessness doesn't wipe them all out, first.

### Emotionally, Too

The terminology problem also works more broadly, because some have taken it upon themselves to tell themselves (and us) that we have no hope.  They will tell us that democracy has died, that we no longer have a country, or whatever.  Learn to endure, they tell us, and stop worrying about identity politics.

Except...wait, didn't mostly those same people tell us to stop worrying about identity politics and focus on "kitchen table issues"---whatever that means---before the election?  And remind me, how did that work out for everybody?

It turns out that this hopelessness favors the fascists, because it encourages us to stop fighting.  And worse, they do this while we see Trump and his lackeys back down on [freezing federal aid](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-rescinds-order-attempting-freeze-federal-aid-spen-rcna189852) and [tariffs on Chinese goods](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-china-tariffs), because of the backlash.

For all their hatred, ignorance, and greed---and I've talked about this a bit, when I talked about [calling them weird]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %})---they need a strong belief in their popularity and relatability.  If Trump still [obsesses about crowd size](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-08-14/trump-kamala-harris-crowd-size-presidential-campaign), and sends his lackeys to talk about his [wildly popular policies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karoline-leavitt/#:~:text=wildly%20popular) that [people actually dislike](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-sour-some-trumps-early-moves-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-01-28/).

They won't back down on everything, for reasons that I'll talk about in the next section, but in most cases, when it comes down to choosing between Project 2025 and their images, they don't want to dismantle the country *that* bad, for the most part.  Maintain hope, because no matter what the alarmists say, we can fight back, both directly and---as mentioned above---by convincing representatives that they have support in defying this agenda.

I do want to call out one specific emotional framing that has gotten out of control for decades, though, the idea that things have never gotten this bad before.  It might *feel* that way, but we should keep in mind that you only need to travel back about three hundred years to find a world where nearly every single human lived under an autocratic regime, and it only took about fifty years of writers asking [but what if...human rights?]({% post_url 2020-09-06-enlight %}) for that to collapse in the [Atlantic Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions), giving us a modern world where autocracies either get propped up by oil money, barely outlive pet rodents, or have no relevance to the rest of the world.  Seventy years ago, most women still couldn't have their own finances and, in the United States, vigilante mobs might brutally and publicly murder any non-white person with no consequences.  We had literal chattel slavery for centuries, in this country.  Things have gotten *much* worse than this[^3].

[^3]:  See also:  People who refer to [**The Handmaid's Tale**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale) or [**Parable of the Sower**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_%28novel%29) as "prophetic."  Both books draw on incidents *at the time* in disadvantaged communities and, like all good dystopian fiction, applied it to wealthy white folks, too.  Claiming that this represents the worst of things or that these wonderful authors somehow predicted the future only serves to show that you didn't care about these issues until they landed on your doorstep.

Hell, as I mentioned [after the election]({% post_url 2024-11-10-election %}), the [1984 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election) looked worse than this.

## Choose Your Battles

Everybody should always keep in mind that the Project 2025 agenda comes in four (sometimes overlapping) pieces.

- Actual desired policy that they need in place for some future subversion or theft.
- Policy to appease some far-right voting bloc or other.
- Loyalty tests, to see which legislators, judges, and bureaucrats might stand up to them.
- Garbage to waste our time trying to fight everything.

We won't necessarily know which category each bad idea falls into.  However, for quick examples, we can probably guess that all voter suppression goes into the "real" category at the top, effort to keep them in power even if they can't squash democracy.  In the second category, you have the [Ross Ulbricht pardon](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/trump-pardons-ulbricht-silk-road-00199848) from an administration that salivates over possibly [executing drug dealers](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/10/1152847242/trump-campaign-execute-drug-dealers-smugglers-traffickers-death-row) go to appeasing the libertarians.  The worst of the cabinet secretary picks go in the third category, challenging the Senate to turn down his choices.

And then you have the balance of their [shock and awe tactics](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/opinion/trump-shock-awe.html) to [flood the zone](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/08/1229996820/trump-flood-zone).  Shock and awe, by the way, works by demoralizing the enemy, and Trump wants to do that to *this* country, but I don't want to digress on that.

I do want to make that point, though, because it means that Trump has already told us that a lot of his policy exists to demoralize us and waste our time planning fights against things that his people don't really care about.

Don't try to focus on everything, because it'll [exhaust you](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/outrage-fatigue-is-real-heres-why-we-feel-it-and-how-to-cope/) *by design*.

Oh, I forgot to mention that, if you don't have time for everything---and you don't---focus on policies in that second category.  Project 2025, and therefore the Trump administration, fills itself with mutually exclusive goals, because Republicans have courted nearly every disaffected group.  And as I mentioned about occasional rifts between egos like Trump and Musk, these disaffected groups hate each other almost as much as they hate anyone else.  As Cory Doctorow pointed out, [Project 2025 exposes the fractures in their coalition](https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/14/fracture-lines/#disassembly-manual).  I mentioned in the previous section that they'll back down on a lot of this, given sufficient push-back, because it doesn't matter to them.  And that lets us play these groups off each other.  Get the law-and-order types angry about releasing insurrectionists and drug dealers back onto the streets.  Get the libertarians and anarchists angry about their obsession with controlling bodies.  Set them against each other and against Republicans, letting them carry some of this load as they take on the outrage.

## Act

Winding this messy post down, I want to point to a handful of people thinking about how to expend energy efficiently.

[Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide) leans a bit too heavily on the "popular mandate" narrative---suggesting that the vote swinging to Trump means a rightward shift in public sentiment and not voter suppression, I mean---and believes that pressuring Democrats (often treating them as enemies) to do things that won't succeed will work better than pressuring "safe" Republicans, but they also do have concrete steps that *mostly* have evidence behind them.

[It's going to take multiple strategies to win under Trump 2.0](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/01/social-movement-ecology-helps-groups-unite-under-trump/) from Waging Nonviolence talks about "movement ecology" and the five broad strategies that movements can engage in.  I don't know that they have a complete view of things, because every step seems legal.

I can't go without mentioning the Office of Strategic Service's (predecessor organization to the CIA) [**Simple Sabotage Field Manual**](https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf), which---designed for anti-Nazi direct action---details how to delay and subvert the output of companies and other organizations tasked with enacting the regime's worst policies.  These should go with a mention, by the way, that those who engage in different strategies *probably* want to isolate themselves from others.  If you show up at a demonstration, then people know your position, making you less useful at working secretly and (possibly) undermining attempts to change the system from inside.

And finally, I can't go without mentioning that we have the opportunity to undercut the oligarchs supporting this administration, too.  Abandon whatever of their services and products that you can manage.

Take care of each other out there...
