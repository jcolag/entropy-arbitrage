## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Frame of Mind

Maybe of interest, since the last episode, O'Brien got recruited as a cult leader, in *The Storyteller* over on **DS9**.

Anyway, this episode mostly serves as a vehicle for Riker, so don't expect much.

 > **PICARD**: There are no local authorities. The government is splintered. It seems that there are various factions vying for power. They're desperate for weapons or technology of any kind. Apparently, some of the factions have resorted to torture to gather their information. Well, a Starfleet research team would be a prime target.

First, the fact that you don't *like* the local authorities or have trouble choosing between factions doesn't mean that they don't exist, Jean-Luc.  You'll note that this fits with his prior disrespect of local governments.

Second, *does* a research team---presumably anthropologists and the like---really seem like a "prime target" for torture to get weapons information?  I don't think it does.  They should still help evacuate them from the emerging civil war, but insisting that they need rescue from imminent torture, combined with the insistence that no legitimate authority exists, feels like an excuse to stomp around on foreign territory.

 > **PICARD**: Oh no, no, there'll be plenty of time for that. We don't arrive at Tilonus for another five days. And besides, if you back out, she'll come after me to play the part.

Honestly, that sounds like wishful thinking, too.  Picard doesn't strike me at all as a usable performer, and he could get called away at any time.

Oh, also, starting with the play itself and meandering through the episode, I won't quote it, but we get a *lot* of ableist terminology used in disparaging ways that I'd rather not propagate here.

 > **WORF**: I suggest you pay closer attention, Commander. Your life will be at stake. Do you understand what I am saying?

Apparently, the show has decided to explicitly confirm that Riker never prepares for his missions.

 > **TROI**: Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it.

Remember, the widow credibly accused him of sexual assault in [*A Matter of Perspective*]({% post_url 2023-08-03-matter-perspective %}) and [*Violations*]({% post_url 2024-08-01-violations %}) seemed to strongly suggest that he attacked Troi.  And when his fantasies manifest, like in [*11001001*]({% post_url 2022-08-25-11001001 %}) or [*Hide and Q*]({% post_url 2022-07-21-hide-q %}), he comes up with women to exploit sexually.  Do we really need to see a darker side than that...?

 > **JAYA**: I hear you're a Starfleet officer. I'm Commander Bloom from the *Yorktown*. There are at least a dozen of us here, maybe more. We were kidnapped, brought here against our will. Sanders was on the *Yosemite*. They did something to his mind. I think they're trying to get neurochemicals from our brains. Stafko was with me on the *Yorktown*. I don't know what they did to him. We're going to get out of here. I've made a communicator.

You might recognize "Bloom" (Jaya) as [Susanna Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Thompson), who previously played Varel in [*The Next Phase*]({% post_url 2024-10-24-next-phase %}).

Also, the *Yorktown* or its predecessor got some attention in [**The Voyage Home**]({% post_url 2022-04-07-tvh %}), where I pointed out that most ships by that name take their names from the [Siege of Yorktown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown).

 > **SYRUS**: Try to associate your actions and emotions with logical thoughts. What do you think caused you to act and feel this way?
 >
 > **PICARD**: It was cold and dark because I was outdoors at night. I was in a narrow place. I was walking through an alley.

Apparently, Riker sees Picard as the embodiment of logical thought...

 > **CRUSHER**: Commander, do you know who I am? Do you know where you are? If you can't answer, just listen. You were on an undercover mission to Tilonus Four. Something happened. We were told that you killed somebody, but we do not believe it's true. We're being blocked at every turn. The hospital Administrator denies you're here at all. We're beginning to think that there's some kind of a conspiracy going on. I had to come in here posing as a health official. Sit tight, Commander. We're going to get you out of here.

She *posed* as a health official?  Does a doctor not qualify?  And yeah, this amounts to more of Riker's delusion, but that mostly shifts the blame around, suggesting that he doesn't see her as a health official.

 > **RIKER**: I remember now. I was in an alley. They attacked me from behind. I tried to fight them off with the nisroh Worf gave me. I managed to get off one of them off me, but I think they injected me with some sort of drug.

Well, wait, then.  If this entire setup reflects what the antagonists conditioned him to believe led to his hospitalization, then did he also kill and mutilate one of the attackers like the attendant described?  As mentioned early in the episode, we can't exactly say that he has no history with violent crime, given the sexual assault allegations, and they don't seem to care about these new accusations.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we don't get a lot out of this one, other than the play-within-the-episode.

### The Bad

The use of ableist slurs pertaining to psychological illness abounds in the episode.

They seem to believe that a lack of a unified government means that no authority exists.  They also think that people actively target Federation researchers for interrogation to acquire secret information, justifying illegal missions.

Riker actively dismisses preparation for an important mission.  And despite his prior issues, despite even some evidence that he brutally murdered somebody, some feel that he doesn't embrace his dark side enough.

We get some further indications that people don't take Crusher seriously, suggesting that she would need to fake her way through a health-related job.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when everybody treats Crusher like a delusional novice, which I realize doesn't narrow things down much, but this time it happens in *Suspicions*.
