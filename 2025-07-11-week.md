As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Think about how much money spent---decades of elections so that they could gerrymander districts, propaganda outlets disguised as news, attacks on institutions so that those institutions couldn't act in the best interests of the country, and so forth---primarily because they didn't like the idea of poor people eating.

And some people voted for it, because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for a dark-skinned woman and assumed that it wouldn't affect them directly.

Even though I do occasionally *try* (and almost always fail) to save myself time with these systems, I still don't see the actual value.  And we do need to stack that value against the fairly massive costs at every level.  I've never seen a technology this broken, certainly not with so many people excited about it because it pretends to act like your friend...

I've probably said this many times before, but few things bother me more when people ramble about our world as "the worst timeline" or try to liken it to some dystopian story, as if we haven't spent the last couple of centuries, the last few decades in particular, climbing out of *far* worse situations.  Yes, we have huge problems that we need to solve.  But sixty years ago, many women couldn't get a bank account.  About a decade earlier than that, the United States had extrajudicial executions of Black people because they acted too familiarly with white people.  Three more decades saw two world wars.  Another century, and the West funded its advancement through---this article's realm---mercantile colonialism and slavery.  Another century beyond that, and the overwhelming majority of people lived under autocratic regimes, where some creep claiming that (depending on where you lived) either he had divine blood or his ancestor made a handshake deal with the local god, and therefore owned the entire world including you.  None of what we see came out of nowhere and, on average, we've made things so much better than our ancestors had it.

We also got to this "local minimum," though, because we assumed that we finished and didn't have any more work to do, so don't let that make you complacent.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
