As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

It doesn't *surprise* me that treating children well improves their health, but I always appreciate having numbers to put to that sort of assumption.

I bring this up regularly, but really *think about* how Republicans see their own chances of success, that a singer recommending that people register to vote---and not much more than that---sends them into such a pants-wetting panic.  But they want us to fear them, needing laws to keep certain people out of public discourse entirely, and needing guns to enforce their idea of a "polite society."  Don't fear them.  Vote the impotent losers out and crush their movement.

What makes this even more difficult is that we paper over that fear of job loss with a story about individualism making us all want to negotiate better deals for ourselves.  That story serves to make people who value collective actions think of themselves as outliers who'd have no chance of success.

During the 1980 Presidential campaign, I often heard adults lament how we'd probably have a better time if organized crime ran the government.  At the time, I wrote it off as related to the still-improbable-to-me success of **The Godfather**.  In retrospect, though, I can't help but suspect that this came out of some arm of the Republican Party, both implying that we didn't and shouldn't have a functioning government, and also preparing a generation to accept corruption as a normal part of governance.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Jamendo and Winamp for Creators](https://decafbad.net/2024/01/27/jamendo-and-winamp-for-creators/) from Craig Maloney's Blog

 > Naturally one can't just delete their creator account. Winamp's system is so convoluted that there's always at least one dependency laying around. I can't remove the tracks that are on there, nor can I remove the album that's up there. Albums must have at least two tracks, so I can't delete all of the tracks from the album. As long as I can't delete the tracks or album I can't delete the account.

For those not in the know, Jamendo started life as a discovery system for Free Culture music, and went out of their way to help users find tracks with particular licenses, as well as the usual search criteria.  At some point, they stopped allowing people to search by license, and buried licensing information on individual song pages.  Now, it sounds like they've chosen to monetize "their" catalog without permission from the artists who uploaded their library.

I had hoped that the problems with the other music platforms might snap them out of whatever they envisioned as their modern direction, but apparently it caused them to reinforce that bad idea.
