As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

As a side note, today is the [Transgender Day of Remembrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_Day_of_Remembrance), a memorial to the men and women killed due to someone's transphobia.  It's easy to say "that's some other community," but 2020 has probably shown us more than any other time that---as Benjamin Franklin put it---"We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly, we shall all hang separately."

A have no idea how I managed to schedule this two hours late, but...

 > ...the number grew because the new group includes those “for whom the government did not provide any phone number.”

It's worth pointing out that the same administration that took these children from their families and placed them with foster families is the same administration that now "can't find" those children.  In any other situation, this would be called human trafficking and obstruction of justice, but the administration's supporters somehow believe that the president is working to *prevent* human trafficking.

 > ...“Lawn and Order,” “In Sod We Trust,” and “Make America Rake Again.”

I posted this partly because the slogans are pitch-perfect, but also because one of the most obvious questions about the Four Seasons Total Landscaping incident is how it never came up in the reservation process that there were no conference facilities.  Their sense of humor suggests that they found it as funny as the rest of us do, and never volunteered that bit of information, since the crack legal team with no evidence *surely* knows what they're doing...

 > The claims are backed by dozens of affidavits that offer much in the way of rhetoric, but little in the way of factual support.

As mentioned by many people, the only point of these lawsuits is to convince seventy million people that they were robbed of representation.  There is no evidence, because there isn't massive voter fraud.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [In this liberal fantasy comic, superheroes beat up racist cops and greedy landlords](https://www.fastcompany.com/90574407/in-this-liberal-fantasy-comic-superheroes-beat-up-racist-cops-and-greedy-landlords) from Fast Company

 > “Those games are awesome . . . the only problem is that the base-level assumptions of those games are really ugly . . . it’s very much like this reactionary fantasy of a world where crime is so out of control and nobody is doing anything about it, so it takes the mayor to strip off his shirt, beat everyone up, and get his daughter back.” (Note: That’s literally the plot of Final Fight.)

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Patients give higher ratings to docs of their own race](https://www.futurity.org/doctors-ratings-ethnicity-race-survey-2469652/) from Futurity

 > ...among Black patients, for example, the average ratings for white physicians were 0.03 points lower than those for Black physicians.

In the case of Black patients, there is actual historical reason for that, such as White doctors ignoring their pain.
