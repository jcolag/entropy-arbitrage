This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Meteorite**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Meteorite**
 * Location:  <https://bauxite.itch.io/meteorite>
 * Released:  2018
 * License:  MIT and CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [bauxite](https://bauxite.itch.io/)
 * Medium:  Video game
 * Length:  Approximately ten minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Gun-play, fussy actions

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Meteorite

The page describes the game as follows.

 > Meteorite is a low-res metroidvania FPS, inspired by Metroid Prime, made for LOWREZJAM 2018. Explore a facility on a far away planet, find gun upgrades, and upgrade your movement capabilities to surpass previously unsurmountable obstacles.
 >
 > Your combative skills and self-defense will be tested by numerous turrets and a giant floating eyeball boss that shoots purple laser beams.

Note that, for those of us who don't have much useful experience with or enjoyment of first-person shooters, the Itch page has a full play-through embedded from YouTube.

## What Works Well?

The game feels mostly efficient, moving the player from place to place without making it feel linear.  It becomes clear in retrospect that you only really ever have one next path of relevance, to get the notional key that unlocks the path after it, but the space and structure make it feel more interesting than that.

And while it falls into the "not my thing, personally" category, the game commits to its pixelated aesthetic, amusingly making the pixels feel like physical objects as the perspective changes.  And I didn't see anything that broke with that aesthetic.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

It often feels like the game wants to seem mysterious, but instead mostly only leaves information out.  For example, it gestures at the protagonist working for some important organization, but doesn't identify it even while introducing us to the (highly improbable) Sector Meteorite.  We have "enemy activity," but no indication of the identity of the enemies, except that they apparently go around installing weapons on turrets and have the game's "boss."

The lack of information leads into the play of the game, too, at least for me.  Without the recorded play-through, I don't think that I ever would've figured out how to find or defeat that boss.  Nothing in the game really indicates it.

## Opportunities

The game's Itch page points this out.

 > The source code is available here: [https://github.com/Bauxitedev/meteorite](https://github.com/Bauxitedev/meteorite).

It currently has a second contributor and some work done about two years ago, plus a smattering of issues filed over the years---including a healthy debate over a font then in use---making this a more active project than many we've seen.

## What's Adaptable?

We get a handful of weapons/tools, the facility, and the vague "enemies."

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll listen to **The Pink and Black Album**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
