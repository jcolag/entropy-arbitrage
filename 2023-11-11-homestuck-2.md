To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Homestuck**
 * Location:  <https://www.homestuck.com/>, <https://homestuck.net/>, <https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/>
 * Released:  2009 -- 2016
 * License:  Public Domain as of 2020
 * Creator:  Andrew Hussie
 * Medium:  Transmedia Web Comic
 * Length:  Over one million words
 * Content Advisories:  Cultural insensitivities, coarse language, ableism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Homestuck

The official website describes the comic as follows.

 > Homestuck is a very long webcomic with a quirky style of narration and presentation that makes it look like an old text adventure game—but really, it's just a linear story that you read and watch, barring some of the flash games. People call Homestuck a multimedia masterpiece because it's got musical segments, playable set pieces, cool animations and everything the World Wide Web will allow an artist to put in it.
 >
 > The plot of Homestuck is infamously convoluted but boils down to: four kids who know each other online play a video game together, inadvertently causing the apocalypse. To beat the game, they have to interact with the game world's characters, and with a disgruntled group of internet trolls.

I also note this later description, detailing why the fandom has bothered certain people.

 > Homestuck was an obscure webcomic appealing mainly to Computer Science nerds and Andrew Hussie's previous fan-base until it reached Act 5 Act 1: Hivebent, or The Part With The Trolls, in 2010. The trolls were twelve characters with strong personalities and a simple, recognizable, easily replicable visual template (custom blood colors, horns, zodiac signs on simple clothing).

Anyway, I had never heard of it---or if I did, the name didn't register---until I saw a bunch of people in various online places talking about it.  Investigating, I noticed that someone had built an application to replay the entire series *and* that the copyright at the bottom of the official page reads as follows.

 > Public Domain 2020 -- ∞

Much like [**Green Comet**]({% post_url 2023-06-03-green-comet-1 %}), it would take too long to get through the entire story, so we'll only cover the first two Acts of the story for now, and will maybe return to it at a later date.

## What Works Well?

The action sequences have some decent heft to them, making it seem like the events in the story might have some consequences, while also moving the story along and providing some entertainment.

This section also at least starts to build out the world of the game, its relationship to the game, and why we might care to continue reading.

And while I don't enjoy the ugly stereotypes attached to the character, I have to admit to getting a laugh from the relationship between Rose and her mother.

## What Works...Less Well?

A huge "personal taste" issue, but the focus on Dave annoys me.  Not only does the character grate on my nerves in general, but his story seems to mostly exist to repeat a bunch of exposition that we've already gotten through.  In the time-frame of the story, he ignores the risk to his friends' lives to muse about his "cool" persona, rather than getting anything done.  I don't understand the point, here.

In some ways, this section makes me wonder how it became popular with the various sorts of people who I've noticed talking about the comic, because it feels so...*hateful*, at least at times.  We see a shocking amount of either sentiments or language that has its roots in sexism, something at least similar to racism, ableism, and homophobia.

## Opportunities

Oh, goodness.  I told you that pretty much everybody had seen this except me, right?  The [official page](https://homestuck.net/index.html) notes a [Reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck) and [Discord community](https://discord.gg/homestuck).  Fans have shown up at conventions.  You can download art assets and fan-oriented resources.  Sometimes the creator sells merchandise.

The comic has a robust ecosystem, in other words.

## What's Adaptable?

This section of the story introduces us to Fluthlu, Nrub'yiglith, Oglogoth, the Hephaestus web browser, and the Incipisphere in general.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up our first excursion into **Homestuck** with the last half of Act 2 *Raise of the Conductor's Baton*.

As mentioned previously, by the way, the list of potential works to discuss has run low, so I need to ask for help, again.  If you know of any works---or want to create them---that fit these posts (fictional, narrative, Free Culture, available to the public, and not by creators who we've already discussed), please tell me about them.  Every person who points me to at least one appropriate work with an explanation will receive a free membership on [my {% emoji latte %} Buy Me a Coffee page](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?  Do you have a longer history with it than I do?
