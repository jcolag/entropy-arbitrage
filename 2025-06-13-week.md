As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 09 June 2025

I couldn't get my act together in time to get a full slate of posts scheduled by nine o'clock.  Apologies, because we've had a *massive* news week.

 > The top priority identified in the study was the need for better evidence on effective acute burn treatments, while other priorities related to pain relief and the psychological impact of burns. The survey also highlighted a need for more cost-effective burns data.

To---I imagine---nobody's surprise, we treat burn victims in poorer areas worse...

 > While officials justify them for safety and sanitation reasons, sweeps harm people by severing their ties to caseworkers, medical care, and other vital services. In many cases, basic survival items are confiscated by authorities. Alongside being deadly, research confirms that sweeps are also costly and unproductive.

As usual, we put police to the work of protecting capital from humans, without to me regard for what happens to the humans...

PM2.5 comes largely from fossil fuel combustion in cars, power plants and factories.

What? The Trump administration weaponizing... anything to make our lives harder? You don't say.

More seriously, this illustrates a lot of how the right operates. They take a legitimate issue, here transparency, and take some fringe part of the idea, which becomes a way to bully experts, while also giving the media and moderates cover for pretending that they mean whatever we all like. See also: Efficiency, law, tyranny, weaponize, and so on. Only recently, have they needed to say what they mean, such as with diversity, equity, and inclusion.

This ties into the Thursday post, above. To you or me, civility means respecting everyone, but to the right, it shields *them* from criticism but doesn't bind them when they want to attack their perceived enemies.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > But rather than acknowledge that rolling out a health initiative with a bunch of made-up stuff is kind of not great for the American people, Calley Means, Kennedy‚Äôs MAHA point man, went on NewsNation to say that the incorrect citations were ‚Äúa great disservice to President Trump and Bobby Kennedy.‚Äù

I can almost appreciate how many "efficiency" people have come out of the woodwork to tell us that they seriously thought that they'd find lazy bureaucrats in every government office, only to find overworked zealots fighting to help people. But only "almost," because I don't believe for a moment that they had any idea beyond that things they don't do can't take much work and that they would replace everyone with computers. Always labor with these people...

 > It‚Äôs not so much the Democrats are doing nothing. It‚Äôs that the people who are best situated to make a stink about what has happened ‚Äî to publicize Baraka‚Äôs competing claims about what happened at Delaney Hall, to generate outrage over how the Nadler video debunks DHS, and yes, even to use that sternly worded letter to shame Jim Jordan for abdicating the independence of Article I power ‚Äî are instead spending entire days claiming that nothing is happening except a comment they watched out of context.

I swear, the left always acts like they want to lose. Bash their allies, refuse to participate in building power, and ignore any progress.
