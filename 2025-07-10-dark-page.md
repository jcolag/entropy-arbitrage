## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Dark Page

Since last time, **DS9** had its first major stumble, as it tried to rebut the grim portrayal of disability in episodes such as [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), but arguably ends up reinforcing a lot of it, in *Melora*.

Brace yourself here, too, because it feels like this show tried to solve its dislike of mature women by bringing them in as guest stars to mostly ignore.

 > Captain's log, stardate 47254.1. A delegation of the Cairn have just come on board. This telepathic species has no concept of spoken language, and is being instructed in its use by an old...friend.

We generally use the term [cairn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cairn), when we do at all given its Scottish roots, for a round or conical pile of stones.  In early Britain, people built them as (something like) grave markers.  Otherwise, they often serve as makeshift landmarks to indicate a path.  In other words, we once again have a culture named to give away the plot of the episode...

Also, Picard reluctantly calls her a friend, because hating middle-aged women means *humor*. {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **HEDRIL**: Like my vocal enhancer. It helps me make sounds.

You probably don't need me to explain this one, but if you recognize Hedril, it probably has a little something to do with a young [Kirsten Dunst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Dunst) playing the role.  Her turn to independent film has taken her out of the public eye for a while, but Hollywood seemingly had her everywhere in her early adulthood.

 > **LWAXANA**: Don't worry. The Cairn couldn't read your thoughts even if they wanted to. Your brain isn't sophisticated enough. Neither is yours, dear. They can only communicate with other telepaths. Have either of you seen Deanna?

Mrs. Troi once again shows more compassion than the entire crew combined.  She sees Riker inanely trying to show his superiority to Worf for some reason, so she deliberately puts him down. {% emoji applause %} Brava...

Speaking of supporting Lwaxana, not under a Free License, but I do want to point everybody at [Matt Baume's video essay on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHbTWEXSx1Y) [^1], centered on why he (rightly, I think, after rewatching this show) found it mystifying on recently learning that fans generally hated the character, but also goes on to make a bunch of connections---such as the character taking a lot of inspiration from [**Auntie Mame**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auntie_Mame)---that I would never have even considered might have a story to it.  And he also talks about this show's absurd discomfort with sex as compared to most of the rest of the franchise, much as we have in these posts.

[^1]:  Full disclosure, I've subscribed to Baume's YouTube channel since the days that he hosted the videos in a corny sailor suit, so I didn't find this video accidentally.  If you want a tour through popular culture through the lens of representation for gender and sexual minorities, you could do worse.

 > **MAQUES**: Your mother told me of your need.
 >
 > **TROI**: Need?
 >
 > **MAQUES**: A moment. Husband. You need a husband. I need a wife.

OK, look.  Like this show, I grew up---to the extent that you can say that I did, or the show, for that matter---in the immediate aftermath of the women's liberation movement, so like Troi, I rankle at the idea that a woman "needs" a husband.  However, whereas I and probably you rankle at it because women have value as humans rather than appendages to men, Troi seems to rankle at it because the show wants us to hate Lwaxana.

Seriously, does the franchise have a *less*-liberated woman than Troi?  She has a job, but she doesn't seem to care about it at all.  She not only phones it in wherever possible, but has seriously considered running off with spare-Riker in [*Second Chances*]({% post_url 2025-05-01-second-chances %}) and the eugenicist weirdo in [*The Masterpiece Society*]({% post_url 2024-08-08-masterpiece-society %}), probably among others who I've blocked out of my memory, not to mention going on dates with collegues/patients in episodes like [*Pen Pals*]({% post_url 2023-03-02-pen-pals %}) and [*The Nth Degree*]({% post_url 2024-03-14-nth-degree %}).  If anybody had set her up with Maques other than her mother, would Troi have taken any offense at the situation...?

 > **MAQUES**: This is...privacy?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **MAQUES**: It is normal?

I don't know if this *really* has any bearing on the Federation's culture, but it occurs to me that a better show might have put some effort into this idea, either interrogating whether and why Federation citizens care so much about privacy, or what that looks like when people join who don't understand the concept.

 > **TROI**: It's more than that. I've been sensing very erratic emotions from her. Even the clothes she's wearing are unusual. They're so subdued.

They still need to police her clothing, I guess.  Too loud, too naked, and now too boring.  Let the woman dress herself...

 > **LWAXANA**: Psilo-what?
 >
 > **TROI**: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy.

How does she not know the term?  At her age, surely her science fiction equivalent of vocal cords have come up in either conversation or on a medical exam.  I mean, given its role, it seems like it'd come up as often for her as [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) does in our culture.

 > **TROI**: "Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose." It's an old Earth poem by John Milton.

I mean, *technically*, she could call [**Paradise Lost**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) "a poem"---it comes from [Book IV](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_%281667%29/Book_IV), line 256, in particular---but clocking in at almost half a million words, it seems almost painfully reductive to call it a single poem.

And maybe of interest, given how many times we've seen Troi support authoritarians, we've only really had one other fan of Milton's most famous work, introduced in [*Space Seed*]({% post_url 2020-06-11-seed %})...

 > **TROI**: Oh. Er, Heaven is. Well, it's, how can I put it...?

Also, a quick inspection of the context of the line shows that it describes [Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden), not Heaven.  The overwhelming majority of the story concerns the expulsion from Eden, in fact---the loss of paradise in the title, in fact---only really dealing with Satan's fall from Heaven as background.

I mention it, because we've seen before that the characters---maybe because the writers didn't do their homework, but we can't care about that for our purposes---will sometimes try to show off their deep education, but usually find themselves exposed as frauds.  In [*Captain's Holiday*]({% post_url 2023-09-07-captain-s-holiday %}), for example, Picard makes a show of reading James Joyce, but chooses one of the most approachable Joyce books without any supplemental material that would make it complex reading, not to mention his transparent Shakespeare fakery in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-21-time-s-arrow-2 %}).  Then, in [*The Outrageous Okona*]({% post_url 2022-12-15-outrageous-okona %}), Riker cites **Gulliver's Travels** in a way that shows that he either only watched one of the popular film versions or completely missed the point.  In [*Conundrum*]({% post_url 2024-08-15-conundrum %}), we found out that Troi owns a copy of *Ode to Psyche* by Keats, which felt like an outlier as a less-popular work, but this now goes back to the idea that she cites literature that she probably didn't read.

Maybe more importantly, though, she seems uncomfortable talking about the abstract idea of an afterlife, as if that would violate some strong taboo.  And I note that she wouldn't have gotten herself into this situation, had she used the word "paradise," from the epic poem's *title*.

She ChatGPT'd herself, in other words.

 > **TROI**: I don't understand. She was fine just yesterday.

By yesterday, does she mean earlier in the episode, when she insisted that her mother had some horrifying illness because she wore brown?

 > **PICARD**: Might there be some side effect of Cairn telepathy of which we're unaware?

Sure, blame the foreigners.  Why not?

 > **TROI**: *Down in the Valley*.

Shockingly, [*Down in the Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_in_the_Valley_%28folk_song%29) actually exists, and not only that, it comes from the 1920s instead of the 1930s, dramatically expanding this crew's cultural context...

 > **CRUSHER**: Does your mother keep personal logs or a journal?
 >
 > **TROI**: Yes, she does. I'll contact Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him to transmit a copy as soon as possible. There may be some clues there.

Did Troi take credit for Crusher's idea?  Or maybe she assumed that Crusher didn't have any motivation for asking about the diaries...

 > **DATA**: Perhaps we are being too literal. I have recently learned in my study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimes represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming.

"As somebody with literal weeks of experience dreaming, and little to no interest in analyzing them..."

 > **PICARD**: Then let's start at the beginning. The first entry seems to be stardate 30620.1.
 >
 > **TROI**: That's the year they were married.

This show has trained us that every thousand dates represents a season, *probably* about a year.  Do seasons last much longer than years?  Did Lwaxana get married only seventeen years ago, then?  Did they change the format again?  Or did the writers not bother to look up their own rule that they use in literally every episode including this one...?

 > **TROI**: No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal? Did something happen to you that you don't want me to know about?

Did Troi really try to make her mother's crisis about her?  If either of my parents kept a diary and removed a section, I don't think that I'd even put myself in the top *twenty* possible reasons for the omission, let alone feel the need to confront them about it like this, especially instead of helping.

 > **TROI**: Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I had a sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous about her. To celebrate her life, not mourn it.

Riker has an accidental twin.  Data has an evil twin.  Worf has a brother who can't acknowledge him at the moment, if I remember correctly, and...well, give it about a month and a half for the other revelation.  Yar had a previously unmentioned sister *and* a Romulan daughter who looks exactly like her.  Now Troi has a secret (if dead) sister.  It all sounds so much like hack writing that, next, you'll tell me that Picard has a secret Romulan twin or something out there that we'll need to talk about around the new year...

## Conclusions

We've expanded our idea of popular culture to **Paradise Lost**---minimized as only a poem---and *Down in the Valley*.  And we also see an emphasis on privacy, for a bit.

### The Bad

The crew reiterates that it doesn't take mature women seriously, from dismissing them outright to policing their clothing.  We likewise see, once again, that outsiders see their bigotry and toxic masculinity, and they push back against it.

Closely related, we see the common mode of racism of presuming that the most recent group of foreigners must have caused the crew's current problems.

At least civilian doctors don't appear to educate their patients, not discussing critical indicators in a way that makes the terms recognizable.

Troi, at least, seems to misunderstand **Paradise Lost** despite quoting it.

People find it uncomfortable to describe the idea of an afterlife.

The strange dominance games have grown beyond the men to women taking credit for each other's ideas.  Although men also feel the need to interject on topics that they have little experience in.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the series tries *really* hard to bring back the uninteresting romantic tension between Picard and Crusher from the first season, in *Attached*.
