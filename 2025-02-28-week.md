As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:01 -- Mon 24 February 2025

For the next four years, keep reminding yourself about not only this, but that Trump's "shock and awe" tactics presume the American people as a population to demoralize.  In many ways, this quickly became a fight *over* optimism.

I know:  It will come as a complete surprise to everybody that Trump's big show of compassion has its roots in racist lies and pushing for a return to Apartheid.  You can see my surprised face...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114065603640232536)

 > We are sneered at for not being the social and intellectual equals, after sixty years of Western civilization, of people with thousands of years of this same civilization; yet when we set out to try to lessen the distance between us, we are treated as if the attempt were a crime. Why not give us the chance to try? Are some white people really afraid that we might succeed?

I would also point out---as I have before---how Presidents of the US, even Nixon, also retreated from terrible plans or even enacted progressive legislation, because they had to choose between that and dealing with an enraged and engaged population.

Finally, somebody with some sense, instead of trotting out the "kitchen table issues" nonsense in a country where significantly more than half the population has a direct stake in the Project 2025 visions of white supremacist, Christo-fascist patriarchy.  What do you *think* they talk about around the kitchen table...?

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Not Even DOGE Employees Know Who‚Äôs Legally Running DOGE](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-leadership-administrator/) from Wired

 > This isn‚Äôt a trivial matter. The executive order establishing DOGE plainly states, ‚ÄúThere shall be a USDS Administrator established in the Executive Office of the President who shall report to the White House Chief of Staff.‚Äù

It somehow doesn't surprise me at all that they've violated their own self-imposed rules and eliminated any traces of who we can hold accountable.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1345174204.jpg|An environmental protest|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The War on Science Is a War on the Public](https://otherwords.org/the-war-on-science-is-a-war-on-the-public/) from OtherWords

 > By censoring and defunding climate science, Trump and his cronies are trying to erase the link between these impacts and fossil fuel pollution. Trump has been [effectively bribed](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2025/01/14/oklahoma-billionaire-harold-hamm-to-host-exclusive-inauguration-party/77693111007/) by [fossil fuel oligarchs](https://www.eenews.net/articles/billionaire-kelcy-warren-invests-in-pipelines-and-trump/) ‚Äî and he‚Äôs returning the favor by making it [official U.S. government policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to [remove all restraints](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) on the growth of their industry.

Again, this shouldn't surprise anybody.  Trump has all but outright *said* that he considers the American people his enemy, with his shock-and-awe rhetoric.
