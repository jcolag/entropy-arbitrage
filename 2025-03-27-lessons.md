## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Lessons

Let's jump in.

 > **DATA**: Actually, good morning, sir. Ship status is---

I want to remind everybody that this takes place *in space*, where they don't have a natural or consistent day or night.  Yet Data felt the responsibility to make this completely inconsequential correction, even while he rushes to kiss up.

 > **PICARD**: I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site on Landris Two. Could you put it through to my Ready room?

Not really related to our goals, here, but I do find it fairly funny how quickly and completely "somewhat interested in archaeology" became Picard's entire personality.

 > **DATA**: I'm sorry, sir, but Stellar Cartography has requested a communications blackout while they run an experiment.

How does Picard not know this?  I mean, surely, you don't shut down communications without his approval, right?  Don't worry; it gets worse.

 > **COMPUTER**: Replicator systems are offline at the request of---
 >
 > **PICARD**/**COMPUTER**: Stellar Cartography.

Apparently, you can turn off the *food* and communications (and library), while people have work to do, without clearing it.

We can assume, based on the argument in [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}), that Picard runs the *Enterprise* on three shifts.  We don't know the staffing of those shifts, but they'd need to have enough people to handle normal operations and emergencies, which would probably take a significant chunk of their thousand people.  I point all this out, because telling dozens or hundreds of people that they can't eat, read, or contact anybody for a few hours seems wildly irresponsible.

 > **DAREN**: Earl Grey? No wonder you can't sleep. Computer, bring replicators back online and give me a cup of Daren herbal tea blend number three, hot. You shouldn't be drinking a stimulant at this time of night. I think you'll like this.

Picard, liking something new?  Hilarious...

 > **DATA**: Captain, I would like to remind you of our concert this evening in Ten Forward. We will perform Chopin's *Trio in G Minor*.

The [piano trio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Trio_%28Chopin%29) in question has a couple of interesting aspects, such as its mimicking of Beethoven in sections, the disappointing violin parts, and so forth.  In fact, it seems so quirky, probably owing to Chopin's youth at the time that he wrote it, that it feels like it *must* have some relevance to the plot, but...nope, not that I can see.

 > **PICARD**: It's an herbal tea blend. I, er, found it in the replicator files. Have you met any of the new crew-members who came aboard at Starbase two-eighteen?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: I met the new head of Stellar Sciences last night. Lieutenant Commander Daren.

Notice that Picard wants to both hide and brag about his fledgling relationship.  And much like Crusher's relationship in [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}) and Troi's relationship in [*The Masterpiece Society*]({% post_url 2024-08-08-masterpiece-society %}), they try to hide the closest that they come to healthy relationships.  I'll get to the problems with this relationship later, but in its defense, Daren seems to have initially pursued him, and they seem equally enthusiastic, they'll separate their personal and professional lives, they have similar ages, and neither of them wants to hurt or exploit the other.

And sure, I know in retrospect that the episode *really* wants to remind us that Picard and Crusher have feelings for each other, but the secrecy also comes up again later.

 > **PICARD**: Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartography isn't everybody's cup of tea.

Ah, the recurring "make Crusher feel bad for not getting excited about physics" plot that Wesley used to take care of.

 > **PICARD**: I wanted to ask, during the second arpeggio in the first movement, I noticed that you played an F minor chord instead of a diminished D.

No.  I refuse to believe that Picard can tell the difference, or that he paid attention to any of the music at all.  You could *probably* convince me that Data coached him on the conversation, though, since he would surely whine about deviations from the 1820s score to anybody who didn't run away quickly enough.

 > **PICARD**: Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren.

Picard has Bach's [Brandenburg Concerto No. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concertos#Concerto_No._3_in_G_major,_BWV_1048) on.  He'll mention it later, but I might as well link while we have the music fresh.

 > **PICARD**: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I?

Yes, let's mansplain how to work a *penny whistle*.

 > **DAREN**: I may not be as precise as a computer, but I think you'll enjoy it more. Why don't we start with something a little simpler. How about...?

Oh, she has his number with [*Frère Jacques*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A8re_Jacques), seemingly Picard's favorite song, recurring at least since [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}).

 > **PICARD**: Number One, my fencing partner's cancelled for this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Fencing? I'm really not very good.
 >
 > **PICARD**: It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it.

Yep.  Picard bullied his subordinate into joining him on a play-date, going for fencing after failing to con him into riding horses in the Himalayas in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}).  A better episode would use this to underscore the value of his romance with Daren, because she spends time with him enthusiastically, which might teach him to stop pushing people.

 > **PICARD**: It's...an old folk melody.

You presumably recognize the definitely-not-[*The-Skye-Boat-Song*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Skye_Boat_Song) from [*The Inner Light*]({% post_url 2024-10-31-inner-light %}).  He'll later recount the plot for those among us who might have missed it.

 > **PICARD**: Sit down, Counselor. I want to talk to you about a matter of protocol. I know there are no Starfleet regulations about a Captain becoming involved with a fellow officer, but---

They don't?  Not even for the boss?  That seems like a hostile work environment waiting to happen.  And didn't Picard make a big deal about how he'd *totally* sleep with Tasha Yar if he didn't have rules to follow in [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %})...?

 > **TROI**: That's true. But cutting yourself off from your feelings can carry consequences that are just as serious.

To absolutely nobody's surprise, Troi recommends doing whatever you want.

 > **PICARD**: If I were, would you give it?
 >
 > **TROI**: Yes.

They say this as if she has *ever* had a difference of opinion with Picard.

 > **RIKER**: Transfers are to be approved by me before any offers are made.

His poor ego...

 > **PICARD**: Then let her do it, and feel free to do yours. Ship's resources are your responsibility. I've always had absolute confidence in your judgment.

Other than that last bit, Picard actually kind of understands how to handle this.

 > **PICARD**: That's what I told him. But we have to be careful. Obviously it's easy for people to misunderstand.

OK, maybe I spoke too soon, if he felt the need to bring it up on his date.

 > **DAREN**: Would something like that work here?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: You know, it might. The storm is approaching the outpost from this direction. If we were to set up a series of thermal deflector units along the northern perimeter, we could create a fire wall and deflect some of the heat. The insulation from the outpost should be able to handle the rest.

Maybe not relevant, but I feel like I've raised this issue before, but it often feels like La Forge has *no* idea how any of this technology works.  The writers probably build these conversations so that everybody seems to contribute, but it leaves the engineer saying things like, "wow, yeah, maybe we could use equipment for the exact task that people designed it to do," instead of already having the problem solved.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46697.2. Although we succeeded in rescuing all six hundred forty-three Bersallin colonists we lost eight crew-members. Let the record show that they gave their lives in the performance of their duty.

Ah, yes, "performance of their duty," not "saving hundreds of lives."  They have their priorities, after all.

 > **DAREN**: A small part, maybe. But in the end, I was more afraid that you would blame yourself if I died. Would you have?
 >
 > **PICARD**: I've lost people under my command. People who were very dear to me. But never someone I've been in love with. And when I believed that you were dead, I just began to shut down. I didn't want to think or feel. I was here in my quarters, and the only thing I could focus on was my music, and how it would never again give me any joy. Then I saw you standing on the transporter pad and I knew that I could never again put your life in jeopardy.

Thank goodness that they managed to make her near-death experience about the burden placed on *him*...

 > **PICARD**: You could always resign your commission. Stay here with me.

Eww.  Since we already needed to invoke his name, I should mention how much this reminds me of Wesley's nonsense in [*The Dauphin*]({% post_url 2023-01-26-dauphin %}), telling a head of state that she should abandon her people to become completely dependent on him.  And Daren pitches the complementary idea of Picard resigning, and they both treat it as a joke, like it sounds ridiculous for a *man* to quit his job to stay with a person he loves.  And that dovetails with the previous line, where her almost dying really inconvenienced him more.

This also feels like it resonates with what we learned about the Crushers' relationship in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}), strongly suggesting that Jack abandoned Beverly to deal with her pregnancy and education, while also "joking" that she married him to get ahead in the world.

## Conclusions

We get a surprising amount of music in this episode.

### The Good

They do, at least, seem to understand that a personal relationship doesn't need to damage professional standing, provided that everybody acts professionally on the job...even if they don't necessarily apply that.

### The Bad

People can turn off important, arguably necessary functions for hours at a time, because they'd like to use that computer memory.

Once again, we see that people try to hide their relatively healthy relationships.  They don't seem to know the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships, as powerful people pressure their colleagues to spend time with them and ask those subordinates to validate their emotions.  And despite their ability to realize that personal relationships don't need to result in preferential treatment, they also act to compensate for presumed preferential treatment instead of putting up guard-rails on those decisions.

The episode continues the idea that the female doctor should feel bad about herself for not having a deep interest in physics or engineering.  And Picard feels the urge to explain how to properly play one of the least complicated musical instruments possible.  They also treat it as a given that Picard's career carries more importance than a woman's.

Despite prior assertions to the contrary, Starfleet apparently has no regulations or guidelines for leaders having affairs with their subordinates.  Staffing, however, they have rules that seem designed to ignore the desires of the staff.

Therapy in the Federation continues to show itself as somewhere between useless and destructive.

We get a reminder that the Federation prioritizes a person's productivity over their life.

### The Weird

Everybody seems to act extremely fussy about the time of their artificial day beyond scheduling.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next time, when we hold out hope for the best biscuit recipe, in *The Chase*.
