As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I normally ignore articles about the UK, but this caught my interest due to the important activism.

I don't actually know what preschool looks like, these days, but my extremely vague recollection of those days in my life seem to back this.  Students from wealthier backgrounds expect everyone to want to interact with them and help them, while those from backgrounds where they might not have constant companionship often got left behind.

Admittedly, I always find it bizarre when I see articles say things like, "Hawley is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School who clerked on the Supreme Court and in general has a reputation as one of the Republican Party‚Äôs most brilliant minds," because that gets right to the heart of most journalism about Republicans.  People try to dig for nice things to say about them, creating this mystique, instead of beginning and ending with the fact that he worries about men becoming too effeminate---which shows a remarkable level of homophobia and misogyny---and spends his time with white nationalists.  Why would I care that people call him intelligent?

I've written about the [origins of policing]({% post_url 2020-05-31-police %}), and this report confirms a lot of what I indicated, there.  We don't have a problem with "bad cops."  We have a problem of building systems designed to enforce white supremacy, which encourages and requires the "good" and "bad" cops to treat people differently based on race.

 > I don't usually comment on things when I share them, but *seriously*:  While any time makes a great opportunity to cut back on corporate-produced entertainment and spend at least the remaining amount on indie artists (to atone for your *Star Wars* habit or whatever you have), today makes an especially good time to do that.

 > Partly, because doing so will help diversify the media available to us, so that we don't have half a dozen companies with overlapping shareholders controlling every industry.  But also because I think it would look hilarious if things got so bad for the studios that Disney had to sell Indiana Jones on eBay or Discovery/Warner had to find a different parking lot management company to sell DC to, since Kinney no longer exists.

I also dropped an [edited version <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/110709272841469108), for the people who prefer it.

Do I need to explain this?  Does anybody need me to expand on any of the details?  Oh, OK, but I did warn you.

I'd *like* people to spend more on Free Culture, specifically, because that way we all win.  But I'll happily accept...OK, look, I can't find *great* numbers, but it looks like the average American currently spends about five hundred dollars per year on streaming services.  I assume that they mean "individual adult" and not household, and the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/adult-and-under-the-age-of-18-populations-2020-census.html) tells me that about 78% of our population of about 333,287,557 has become an adult, or 259,631,007, giving one country---I don't have the patience to run the numbers for the rest of the world, but I'd love it if someone else did the work for me---a streaming budget of $129,815,503,500, or one-point-three billion dollars.

That only includes streaming.  It doesn't include buying physical media or digital downloads.  It doesn't include going to the movie theater.  The number probably does include music, and I don't know how much that would account for.  But as an approximation to start with, we have well over a billion dollars.

Do you have any idea what that would look like if we spent that kind of money on independent media, instead?  Think about only the sorts of works that we've seen in the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub), and the *tiny* budgets that people used to create them.  If we gave half a hundred thousand dollars---a tiny fraction of the streaming total---to the creators of something like [**Valkaama**]({% post_url 2021-03-27-valkaama %}), for example, would we have an endless franchise with its own multiverse but some parts of it deleted from the historical record over contractual disputes, or would we have dozens of additional works that we can share and adapt?

Meanwhile, it sounds like the studios already feel some pain.  Disney+ started losing subscribers over the winter, and it sounds like none of Disney's current theatrical releases have lived up to expectations.  Paramount has also tried to stem massive losses for the past couple of months, leading some analysts to start speculating on which studio will buy them at a huge discount.  Warner/Discovery hasn't stopped flailing since well before AT&T bought them.  If we give them money, they'll pass it on as CEO bonuses and stock buy-back...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > This is particularly pathetic in cases like that of SourceGraph, which used a permissive Apache 2.0 license. Such licenses already allow their software to be incorporated into non-free commercial works, such is the defining nature of a permissive license, with relatively few obligations: in this case, a simple attribution will suffice.

Agreed on all counts.  Nobody uses a Contributor License Agreement for their Free Software project *unless* they plan to change the license once the project becomes popular, and shake off the community.  I don't know why people keep falling for the scam.

## Follow Me

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
