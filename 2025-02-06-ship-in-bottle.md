## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Ship in a Bottle

We join this episode already in progress...of characters messing around instead of doing any interesting work.

Speaking of which, in our world, since the end of [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-30-chain-command-2 %})---when Picard endured days of torture, by the way---**Deep Space Nine** launched.  Watching this in real-time in 1993, *Emissary* introduced us to the politically charged environment orbiting Bajor, and included a series of vignettes (most prominently, Sisko telling off Picard) showing Starfleet as something like a club for callous, privileged kids.  Terrorism threatens the fragile peace in *Past Prologue*.  Mob violence nearly takes the station in *A Man Alone*.  And the entire crew nearly dies of a genetically engineered virus in *Babel*.  I believe that the last would have aired in the prior hour[^1].

[^1]:  I see a lot of evidence suggesting that **DS9** had official airing dates on the previous night, but I also remember the two shows as a programming block, so maybe my local station saved the episode for the next day, or maybe I misremembered the situation and actually carved out two nights every week to watch this.

Why point that out if I don't intend to discuss the episodes in airing order?  Like the real-world context of certain episodes impacts what we see in the dialogue, it seems somewhat unlikely that the writers scheduled episodes accidentally.  I won't comment on the episodes, not least because I won't re-watch them until the blog gets to them, but I do want to try to remember to provide that context to the posts---in this case, my "callous, privileged kids" comment might prove relevant, this week---and (I hope) remember to follow up in the later-covered episodes.

 > **LAFORGE**: Reg, something went wrong with the holodeck program again.

Yes, we definitely can't expect these people to play substandard games.  Best to bring in an A-list engineer to fix a plot hole...

 > **LAFORGE**: Thanks, Reg. We should get back to Engineering, Data. Computer, end program and save.

Wait, they did this during *work hours*?  I guess that shouldn't surprise me, at this point.  At least they don't have anything else pressing to deal with.  Oh, they need to get everything set up for a major and unique astronomical event happening within the next few hours?  Never mind, then...

 > **BARCLAY**: Sorry, Commander. I'm on my way to the holodeck.

Does La Forge *not* realize that he ordered him to do this, only moments ago?

 > **BARCLAY**: Protected memory? Display those sequences. Computer unlock this sequence and run the program.

We've talked about a *lot* of unprofessional behavior in this franchise, but this feels like the least professional action that we've seen.  You don't find sealed files on a shared computer and decide that you need to check it out.

That said, it also seems like terrible security practice to protect data but not annotate it so that people know *why* they shouldn't touch it.

 > **MORIARTY**: Professor James Moriarty.

As you've probably already figured out, this episode serves as a direct sequel to [*Elementary, Dear Data*]({% post_url 2022-12-08-dear-data %}).

 > **MORIARTY**: Damn you, Picard. He promised me something would be done. I should have realized he would have said anything to get me to release my hostage.

In *Elementary, Dear Data*, I noted near the end that Picard's first attempt to settle a conflict peacefully appeared to have something to do with the antagonist presenting as a white man with an upper-class background, even though he presented much more of a threat than most prior antagonists.  Here, though, we see that this looked less like compromise than outright lying to isolate and abandon a conscious being that they created.

We've seen this before, mind you.  As early as [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %}), they humiliated and deposed the head of state, while agitating for social change in [*Angel One*]({% post_url 2022-08-18-angel %}).  In [*Justice*]({% post_url 2022-07-07-justice %}) and other episodes, they upend the native religious belief.  [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %}) and other episodes featured attempted genocide.  This crew has left something of a trail behind it in its poorly planned interventions and negotiations.

I'd say that the franchise could probably mine a lot of stories out of following up on these failures, but you'll note that they launched **Lower Decks** with almost exactly that premise, but almost never engaged with its "second contact" mission, and when it did, it made sure to tell us that Picard actually always made the right call.  Likewise, **Picard** brought in Romulan refugees treated as an underclass, synthetic beings---androids and holographic characters---"disassembled" as collective punishment for a minor act of violence, Changelings (from **DS9**) objecting to the Federation's attempt to wipe them out their people, and the Borg, who Picard tried to exterminate in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}), and he "solved" those problems by either ignoring them or committing violence, there, too.

 > **BARCLAY**: What are you talking about? You can't possibly have been aware of the passage of time.

Remember, this "story arc" actually begins in [*The Big Goodbye*]({% post_url 2022-08-04-big-goodbye %}), in many ways, when we discovered near the end that the one-off holodeck characters have introspective concerns about their fates when the computer turns them off; a deleted scene in this episode indicates that turning them off causes them discomfort or pain, too, to answer that question.  In all that time, based on Barclay's reaction, it sounds like nobody has followed up on any of these potential signs of consciousness.

 > **PICARD**: I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spent some time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it still remains a mystery.
 >
 > **MORIARTY**: It is also irrelevant. What concerns me is finding a way to leave the holodeck.

I should also mention that it seems peculiar (or would for better characters) for Picard and the Federation to prioritize figuring out how consciousness arose over *helping* the guy.  Two possible reasons come to mind, both based on precedent in the show, and neither particularly good.  First, they might want to prevent any characters from developing consciousness in the future, much as they tried to stifle the development of the exocomps in [*The Quality of Life*]({% post_url 2025-01-16-quality-life %}) a couple of weeks ago.  Alternatively, [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %}) strongly implied---or maybe stated outright---that they wanted to figure out how to mass-produce androids like Data and Lal.

 > **PICARD**: Unfortunately, they have not arrived at a solution either.

For reference *we* have (minimal) telepresence robots, for making people calling into video conference calls slightly less awkward.  You can't tell me that none of them figured out "tablet strapped to Alexander's remote-controlled car" from [*Rascals*]({% post_url 2025-01-02-rascals %}).  It wouldn't work well, but it'd start to solve the problem.

 > **PICARD**: Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced the passage of time while you were stored in the computer memory. I can assure you, we had no idea that that would be the case.

Ah.  It concerns him that he got *caught*.  If he left Moriarty behind and time didn't advance for him, then he could pretend that nothing happened.

 > **PICARD**: Professor, I understand your frustration.

Picard apparently learned to solve problems from ChatGPT.  He won't fix anything, but he does know enough to spew out boilerplate that lets him pretend to care enough that yelling at him feels mean.

 > **MORIARTY**: Certainly, sir. Policemen. I'd recognize them in any century.

I don't know if they meant to draw attention to it with this line, but I do need to note the subtext of calling in police to threaten an "uppity" minority into backing down.  After all, let him wander around, and he might start to think that he deserves civil liberties...

 > **PICARD**: Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminal behavior is as unacceptable in the twenty-fourth century as it was in the nineteenth. And much harder to get away with.

He couldn't wait to accuse him of plotting crime, you'll notice.  I wonder if that had something to do with his delay in dealing with this problem, punishing him for a preconception.

 > **PICARD**: Even if I had reason to believe that would be successful, I don't think that I could sanction it. Please understand, Professor, that you are in essence a new life form. One that we didn't intend to create and that we don't fully understand. Now the moral and ethical implications of deliberately creating another one like you are overwhelming.

Does Picard feel the same way about babies?  I ask, because that feels like it also carries moral and ethical implications, but he has never really worried about the morality of even his own officers raising children.  He also didn't really oppose the creation of Lal in [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %}) on any of these grounds.  I don't want to say that he *definitely* lied, here, but...

 > **PICARD**: Professor, I wonder why you're in so much of a hurry. Is this woman involved with you in some illegal venture?

That makes two attempts to trick him into admitting some secret criminal intent.

 > **MORIARTY**: If you harm me, sir, I will not be able to relinquish voice control of your vessel.

Note that at least Worf's console has a hidden phaser.  Apparently, they need the ability to shoot at people at all times, but don't want anybody to *know* that they can do it.

 > **LAFORGE**: That's a big leap, Data. I just don't think the transporter is going to accept simulated matter.

Not to intrude on the technobabble wasting our time, but either they have matter or don't, right?  How the matter got there seems uninteresting.

 > **COUNTESS**: Are you here to see Mister Holmes, or perhaps Professor Moriarty? Neither is in just now.

You might recognize the countess as [Stephanie Beacham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Beacham), who has had a decent career.  Months after this episode aired, she would go on to join the supporting cast of [SeaQuest DSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaQuest_DSV).

 > **RIKER**: Mister La Forge, start working on the problem.

I feel like I should note that, much like in *Elementary, Dear Data*, they generally refuse to negotiate with threats, *except* when a white guy takes control of the ship.

 > **RIKER**: Open shuttle-bay doors.

The *Sakharov* presumably takes its name from [Andrei Sakharov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Sakharov), nuclear scientist turned human rights activist, for whom the [freedom of thought prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakharov_Prize) also takes its name.  He invented the [tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) design that almost everybody still uses when trying to get nuclear fusion reactors to work, among other things, and started to oppose nuclear proliferation in the 1960s, leading to his becoming one of the Soviet Union's most public political dissidents until his (internal) exile in 1980 and death in 1989, only a couple of years before this episode...oh, and with a Nobel Peace Prize in there, too.

 > **PICARD**: Computer. Store program Picard delta one in active memory and discontinue simulation.

Yes, our heroic protagonist chose to help Moriarty by...tricking him into walking into a cage, so that they could go back to ignoring him, almost exactly his solution the first time.

## Conclusions

We won't get much out of this episode, since the majority of it takes place inside their game.  However, we've squeezed more from less.

### The Bad

The crew continues to play games while not only on duty, but with critical deadlines approaching.  And they use other resources to improve their gaming experience.

We still see terrible data security.  They, as their first reaction to locked files, have the computer unlock and open whatever they find without wondering if maybe somebody did it on purpose, and people locking their files don't leave notes to explain why.

Both in dialogue and in the resolution of the episode, the episode emphasizes that Picard prioritizes avoiding problems, telling novel forms of life whatever it will take to silence their demands for fair treatment, so that he can move on.  They don't even spend time wondering if their victims notice the problem.  But they will try to investigate how to reproduce the incident that leads to giving them life and consciousness.  Likewise, they seem to prioritize controlling and suppressing novel forms of life over allowing them freedom.  But they do respond to threats, provided that the person presents as white and male.

Some computer consoles contain hidden weapons.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next time, when La Forge tries to date a felon, but gets it all in the wrong order, in *Aquiel*.
