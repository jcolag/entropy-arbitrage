As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Not because small business owners are incapable of being petty tyrants, but because whatever else, they will be petty. They won't be able to hire million-dollar-a-month union-busting law-firms, they won't be able to bribe Congress to pass favorable laws, they can't capture their regulators with juicy offers of sweet jobs after their government service ends.

I definitely wouldn't call it a coincidence that, while this monopoly-forward policy got put into action, people started writing cyberpunk stories about people feeling crushed by enormous multinational corporations...

 > Just a 0.1 percent tax ‚Äî that‚Äôs 10 cents on every $100 of stocks, bonds, and derivatives trades ‚Äî would generate an estimated $752 billion over 10 years. That would be more than enough to cover free universal preschool, free community college, and national paid family and medical leave ‚Äî combined.

And by the way, that calculation assumes that the government can't imagine money into existence to pay for services as a sovereign nation...

 > A quarter of developers work at least 10 days of overtime a month, and more than half cited burnout as a reason for peers quitting. Behind these numbers lies a disorganized, inefficient process‚Äîone that remains alarmingly manual and error-prone despite the high-tech backdrop and high-stakes product.

Hashtags:  #Programming #Labor

I should note that I disagree with almost all the conclusions, here, even though the article does fine until then.  You can't fix the development process by isolating developers from the rest of the business.  In every company that I've seen that tried (or needed) to do that, every problem got worse, but now it all happened where management couldn't see it.  In fact, I might argue that the problems have all worsened during my decades in the industry *because* we have increasingly isolated development teams from the rest of the business.

For example, do you know *why* it takes a week to get everybody needed to review code?  It takes a week, because "fewer processes and bottlenecks" and "cutting down on interruptions and distractions that overload engineers and make it tough for them to achieve a state of flow" means that nobody sees value in those reviews, because phrases like that tell the team that nothing matters but writing code.  Why does everything ship late?  They ship late, because "fewer processes and bottlenecks" meant no longer writing specifications and schedules for projects, so that when something starts running behind schedule, nobody sees a big-picture effect.

You don't solve these problems by looking "to early-stage Silicon Valley startups."  You look to manufacturing companies, because *they* know how to get things out the door without constantly asking people to work overtime.

I've mentioned other articles, over the years, linking stress with a depletion of academic ability, so it shouldn't surprise too many people that health also figures into this.

I don't know how much of the industry (or the world, for that matter) quantum computing will *actually* change, but I've loved these tiny glimpses into the field since seeing the then-new [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) in graduate classes.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

An outside observer might almost consider the possibility that the attacker wants to displace the entire population so that they could settle the land...
