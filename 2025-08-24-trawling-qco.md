A while back, I noticed that, despite their final post at the end of 2023 assuring everybody that the site would keep running even though they planned to dissolve the organization, Question Copyright's website has vanished from the web.  And that caused me to do some dumpster diving and archiving to preserve "the good parts."

![A sheet of iced cookies, each in the shape of a question mark](/blog/assets/7004084680_abdf8f5c7b_o.png "To bake or not to bake?")

This post explains the process that I used---viable for many other sites---and how I judged the parts worth it for me to curate from the rest.  If you want to skip my narrative, you can [head directly to the archive](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/) of the ten pages that I found potentially useful enough to preserve.

## Refresh Our Memories

I can't find any "authoritative" source describing the organization, so I'll quote their version.  Links should bump you to the Internet Archive due to the magic of [unrot∙link](https://unrot.link/), but I won't vouch for their sloppy URLs having ever existed, because they used several link formats over time, and the software or editing process would often use the wrong one, especially near the end.  Anyway, their self-description follows.

> Our mission is to provide advocacy and practical education to help cultural producers embrace open distribution.
>
> **QuestionCopyright.org is** a U.S.-based [501(c)(3)](https://questioncopyright.org/index.html%3Fp=74.html#501c3) nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding the range of acceptable public debate about copyright, and to reframing the way people --- especially artists and those who work with them --- think about copyright.
>
> Our organization was founded in 2007 by free software developer, writer and copyright reform activist Karl F. Fogel, as the outgrowth of his activism around issues of copyright restriction and cultural freedom. Since that time, the organization has grown into a collective and mostly volunteer effort of artists, open source developers, and non-profit professionals passionate about opening up opportunities for collaborative cultural production.
>
> **[Our projects](https://questioncopyright.org/projects.html)** highlight the restrictive effects of distribution monopolies, and help creators and their allies realize the potential of freedom-based distribution.  We’re trying to change the terms of the debate, so that copyright reform efforts aren’t stuck always reacting to industry rhetoric that equates copying with theft, plagiarism, and the abuse or destruction of the original work.

And I also have a relevant excerpt from my own post about [**Sita Sings the Blues**]({% post_url 2021-11-06-sita %}).

> ...[Question Copyright](https://questioncopyright.org/), which combines an assortment of genuine issues with the less honest idea that copyright and intellectual property are inherently bad things, and that infringing copyright is inherently and especially good.  Those beliefs lead immediately---and one hopes, accidentally, [even though they don't respond to reasonable criticism](https://questioncopyright.org/understanding-free-content)---to a strongly pro-corporate idealization of the economy, where manufacturers and distributors "deserve" to get paid for owning machines that extrude plastic bits that carry media, but writers should rely on the kindness of strangers while those manufacturers profit from the writers' work.

And in my later post on the [Free Culture movement]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}), I indicated that "I don't necessarily consider QCo a Free Culture organization---because from their name on down, everything strongly suggests that they primarily care about abolishing or curtailing copyright---[but] many people do, so we can't avoid treating it as such."

If I needed to describe it dispassionately, instead of relying on "vibe checks" or marketing, I'd say that they blended (conflated?) Free Culture, opposition to copyright, and praise and support for Nina Paley.

## Archiving

Shortly *before* the website vanished, and after they announced the closure, I skimmed through every article to see if I could pull anything interesting out, to maybe seed a conversation on what a modern Free Culture movement could do, absent the knee-jerk objections to copyright and the hypocritical search for "leaders" who invariably have their own agendas.

I didn't find anything *great*, certainly nothing that I might (for example) syndicate here on the blog, and hoping that I would find something so good that I'd immediately copy it into a post draft prevented me from taking notes.  Oops.

Then, I had the idea of only archiving the most interesting bits.  At that point, I spotted that the website had seemingly gone down permanently, so I waited too long to build the archive.  Oops, again.

### Home-Away-from-Home Page

For the second problem, though, I have an imperfect and often incomplete solution.  When Free Culture-adjacent sites vanish from the Internet or change direction, I reach immediately for the [Wayback Machine Downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader) to see what it can pull together.  Due to the way that the applications serve information, it doesn't do a great job reassembling sites that originally ran as a wiki or on WordPress[^1], hiding things in sub-folders and the like, or creating pages with names like `index.php?page=17&type=html`, but as long as the Internet Archive scraped the site occasionally, the downloader can usually at least get the contents.

[^1]:  When I archived the surviving material from [Fictopedia](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/), I needed to hack through a lot of this, for example, though I also had a personal archive of the page text that I had snagged years ago.

In my case, I ended up with an extremely clunky archive locally, with an index that links to awkward directory pages that often only have an `index.html` or similar file in them.  It would probably work slightly more smoothly hosting the entire thing, but it all still takes a lot of clicking around to read and extract, so it fails as a replica of the original site except as a research tool.  But we also don't need a replica of the original site, and I don't want one.

### Second Pass

Once I had an archive so complete that it even included the spam and malware from times that people exploited WordPress bugs---seriously, that happens a lot, with wikis, too---I restarted the process of reading through each post, this time taking notes on anything that interested me, with the intent of yanking out the page for my own archive.

Did I make biased choices? You *bet* I did.  This archive ignores any post in the following categories.

- A description of an upcoming event or report on a past event,
- Any fawning support of pretty much anything that ("artist-in-residence") Nina Paley wanted them to publicize,
- The tired and often-recycled objections to copyright, and
- Anything otherwise boring.

Yes, I realize that the copyright category represents their entire “bread and butter” issue, but as I've said with increasing frequency, I believe that particular fight has derailed the Free Culture movement and swayed it from making and sharing new things, trying to ally us with media piracy[^2] more than upcycling, so I'd rather leave it in the past where it belongs.

[^2]:  "John, both movements revolve around sharing," I hear you cry.  And sure, but one movement shares on the basis that no project ever completes and everybody willing has something to contribute, whereas the other movement shares finished projects for passive consumption, so that you can continue to support monopolistic companies without paying them.  That feels like the difference between supporting public education and publishing educational entertainment products; you can love both, neither needs to harm anybody, and they can even overlap at times, *but* they have different purposes.

As a word of warning, even among the few remaining posts, I would still *strongly* recommend overhauling most of them before any reuse, and only present them in the archive for their core ideas.  They come at everything from the not-hard-to-guess anti-copyright stance, but many articles also definitely show their age.  I don't know how I expected it to shake out, but ten---nine-and-a-half, really, since one served as a rough draft for its successor---posts out of nearly four hundred definitely catches me off guard, less than a three percent hit rate.

Question Copyright ceded the rights to the site into the public domain, and I see no indication that guest writers used any other licensing.  Even so, I made no changes, not even to the styling or to correct some blatant typos or remove any JavaScript or excess CSS embedded in the pages.  I may try to do that eventually, and will gladly accept a pull request if somebody else wants to take on that effort.

## If You Look to Our Left

If you want a quick tour through the posts and why I chose them, then keep your hands inside the bus at all times, and please save your questions until the end...

### Endorsement Marks

Really the same article in two parts or revisions, the [Author-Endorsed](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/036-author-endorsed-mark.html "The “Author-Endorsed” Mark: A Proposal for Informed Sharing") and later [Creator-Endorsed](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/095-creator-endorsed-mark.html "The Creator-Endorsed Mark") iconography at least express a useful sentiment, if a culture of selling Free Culture works originally created by others returns.  I included both versions of the idea, in case somebody finds something of value in the draft that didn't make it into the final version.  Like the Creative Commons iconography makes it easier to convey a license, these make it easier to convey that---and I suppose that you can get this much information from the titles of the articles---the creator endorses that particular version of the product, and optionally identifies a financial stake in the sale.

I should note, though, that they seem to have angled this idea around physical media, which doesn't remotely seem like the common case anymore.  And for digital media, you would need (or at least want) metadata, akin to the [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/) standard, so that a prospective customer could independently validate the creator's participation, one of the reasons that I became so interested in potential non-educational uses of that technology, a while back, though I have many possible uses in mind.  Regardless of technology, because a prospective publisher has permission to remix a work however they please, and with these images in the public domain, someone with dishonest motives could slap a "creator endorsed" mark on everything, leaving the creators to discover this and try to publicize the lie, without *something* backing the image.

I mean, seriously.

![A poorly cropped version of the Mona Lisa, with the model cradling the Creator Endorsed mark proudly announcing that proceeds support the artist](/blog/assets/mona-lisa-cropped-creator-endorsed.png "I appreciate that the hands and sleeves have a high contrast with their surroundings, meaning that I didn't need to spend hours copying them to another layer...")

No, you can trust me.  I'll *totally* give a cut of the profits to Mr. Da Vinci.  It says so right on the seal.

Likewise, the icons have always struck me as fairly unpleasant to look at, almost like placeholder work that nobody ever had time to fix, even though that wouldn't make sense with dozens of alternative versions.  Somebody, probably several people, thought that the E-inside-the-C looked great, which boggles my mind.  At least enlarge the *E* so that it creates a series of shapes to play with in the negative space...

### Contributions from Known Creators

The [Advertising](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/170-advertising-revenue.html "Advertising Revenue Under a Creator Endorsement Model") and [Small Press](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/208-small-press.html "Hail Caesar: Creative Commons and the Small Press") posts, by Terry Hancock of [**Lunatics**]({% post_url 2022-04-30-lunatics %}) fame and Brandon Bell of [_The Aether Age_:  **Helios**]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %}) fame, respectively, try to get at the specifics of Free Culture in more of a business-oriented context, because even Free Culture zealots need to pay the bills.

The former piggybacks on the Creator-Endorsed idea, building a title-card for videos that include creator-negotiated sponsorship, if you wanted more ideas in that vein.  It also at least implies an iconography for remixing, and discusses the likely value of trying to embed advertising in a work released for others to modify.

The latter announces one of the projects that I have had on the agenda for the [Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) for a while---on the back-burner until I can set aside time to literally sit with it---but also talks a bit about the broader purpose.  In particular, it highlights the boundary between the Free Culture space where we invite everybody to participate (though certainly not always together) and consumerism.  I suspect that a lot of readers will appreciate the analogy, there.

### Licensing in General

The [CC PRO](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/118-cc-pro.html "Proposing CC-PRO: A License For Professionals") and [CC BY-NV](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/367-cc-nv.html "Congratulations to Creative Commons on new CC-BY-NV license") mock-proposals take Creative Commons to task for its mixed messaging and (at least in parts) sloppy implementation, in insisting that the non-commercial and no-derivatives licenses do the same thing as the others[^3].  The former post describes "the best license for professionals (as well as for everyone else)"---a rebranding of CC BY-SA---and the latter describes a license where you can share and modify the work, "as long as no recipient derives any value whatsoever from them, including but not limited to personal pleasure, commercial gain, or artistic benefit," a light parody of the non-commercial and no-derivatives licenses...but also somehow more rigorous than the Creative Commons definition of commercial activity.

[^3]:  Given some of the items that I'll talk about later, *not* in my archive, had the organization continued its activities, would Creative Commons's AI-friendly [Signals]({% post_url 2025-06-29-signal-change %}) have prompted Question Copyright to parody it with something like the "Creative Commons No-Attribution, Bots-Only" license, or would they have cheered on the pillaging AI companies as the apotheosis of their anti-copyright dogma...?

Note that Creative Commons did not actually release any of their "buttons" under their own licenses, so the reworking of them does violate copyright, but a parody of an 88×31 image *has* to qualify as Fair Use if anything does.  I'd probably consider using the images to illustrate good and bad licenses, though, if it didn't violate copyright *and* trademark.  Expect to hear more about this issue in tomorrow's developer diary post, and how I might resolve that for my own purposes, going forward.

Those spoof posts go hand-in-hand with the more serious overview of the various---and all poor---[defenses of the non-commercial and no-derivatives licenses](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/323-nc-and-nd.html "The Future of Creative Commons: Examining defenses of the NC and ND clauses").  It does a nice job of separating out the "free" and "non-free" licenses.  It also, notably, came from a guest writer from a Students for Free Culture chapter.

### Overviews

Finally, we have the more theoretical material.

[What Is Free Culture?](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/264-what-is-free-culture.html "What Is Free Culture?") tries to describe the space, and probably has the largest proportion of material that I disagree with.  They primarily rail against copyright, here---again, to nobody's surprise, I imagine---and suggest that the movement needs to center on what I've learned to call "negative liberties," focusing on not restricting people, instead of talking about what these principles enable.  But it does have a couple of useful kernels in it that somebody could modernize and expand on.

[How To Free Your Work](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/243-free-your-work.html "How To Free Your Work") similarly feels "of its time" and oriented around negative liberties.  Similarly, it shows its age in pushing people to commercial services of the day, and actually suggesting that people *write their own* licenses[^4].  But it at least tries to demystify the actual process of making Free Culture, and I think that we need more of this sort of thing out there...but not so much this instance of it.

[^4]:  Note that I fully believe that everybody has the *ability* to draft a viable license, without consulting a lawyer, that will hold up in court if somebody gets into a dispute that they can't resolve with a friendly chat.  But suggesting that people casually do it, without indicating the massive time-sink involved in gaming out every possible interpretation of every combination of words across multiple jurisdictions, feels reckless, akin to recommending that everybody develop their own encryption algorithms or mix their own pharmaceuticals without mentioning the huge caveat that doing it correctly will probably take at least the rest of your life, if you don't have a lot of education and experience telling you what to watch out for.

And the [Free Culture Five](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/231-free-culture-five.html "Free Culture Five Bookmarks") caused me the most angst in including, because it feels almost painfully self-centered and outdated, with about half the ideas and recommendations designed to drive attention to Paley and her efforts, rather than a broader *culture*.  However, the core concept of "five categories of five things about Free Culture" seems clever, and this feels like a project that the community---or each community, depending on how you want to look at the movement---should resurrect and rehabilitate, this time spreading the attention around to more creators than only a certain Artist-in-Residence and some already-successful books.

## Probably No More Copyright Questions

If you dig through the archives, you'll find some weirder material that I didn't see as having any sustained value, such as announcing the (quickly abandoned) plan to operate a trust[^5] for people to donate their copyrights to---*instead* of advocating for public licenses---or the time that they accidentally satirized the absurd end of their own anti-copyright views by insisting that art actually has no value (because you can and should copy it) except in how much you pay to acquire a copy, so money should go to manufacturers and resellers, not artists (unless the artists become resellers)...and then they dismissed the people in the comments pointing out the blatant anti-artist and anti-labor position, or even the times that they tried to displace Creative Commons licensing in the public eye with an informal statement encouraging copying.  I don't include posts along those lines in the archive, though, because I wanted to preserve the pieces potentially useful to the broader movement, **not** the pieces that confirm my view of Question Copyright as a handful of hypocrites more concerned with hogging the spotlight---and funding a [FART](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/FART#English)---than building an alternate cultural path.  If you know what to look for, though, you can spot a few references to most of those awful posts in what I included in the archive.

[^5]:  Interestingly, digging through the Wayback Machine for other reasons, I note that the early versions of the Creative Commons website *also* suggested that they would "fix copyright" by getting people to donate copyrights to them, where they would then treat those works as in the public domain.  California must have accidentally dumped something in the water...

Anyway, enjoy the archive, build on their foundation, or go build your own archive of only the posts about conference talks, or complaining about specific artists suing over copyright infringement, or whatever...
