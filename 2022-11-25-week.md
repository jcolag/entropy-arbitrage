As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), Fridays host my weekly Twitter roundups.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1594693363768229888) [Remembering Moshe Ha Elion, Sephardic Jewish author and Holocaust survivor from Thessaloniki](https://globalvoices.org/2022/11/15/remembering-moshe-ha-elion-sephardic-jewish-author-and-holocaust-survivor-from-thessaloniki/) from Global Voices

 > Greek anti-fascist activists often warn of increasing antisemitism fueled by right wing extremists, while the local Jewish community is striving to urge authorities to increase the visibility and remembrance of the historic heritage.

We really should have more stories about people like this *before* they die, but at least people won't forget their work.

 > You come here to tell us lies, but we don't want to hear them. If we told you more, you would have paid no attention. That is all I have to say.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1595055247596060672) [80 years ago, Nazi Germany occupied Tunisia --- but North Africans' experiences of World War II often go unheard](https://theconversation.com/80-years-ago-nazi-germany-occupied-tunisia-but-north-africans-experiences-of-world-war-ii-often-go-unheard-194326) from The Conversation

 > ...the French carried on a wartime campaign of anti-Blackness and Islamophobia, pairing these forms of racialized hatred from the colonial era with antisemitism.

I can't speak for anybody else's education, but I only recently realized the actual scopes of the World Wars.  Based on what I learned in school, it always seemed like the "world" amounted to Europe and an oceanic theater, hardly seeming as global as the reality.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1595417383639752705) [Black nurses tell of double hit from pay discrimination and cost of living](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/black-nurses-nhs-poor-pay-discrimination/) from openDemocracy

 > Neomi Bennett, the founder of campaign group Equality 4 Black Nurses, said poor pay is “compounded” by racial discrimination, which means Black nurses are less likely to be promoted than white colleagues.

While this research focuses on England, the effect almost certainly doesn't limit itself geographically.

 > We do not ask for riches; we do not want much; but we want our children properly trained and brought up. We look to you for that. Riches here do no good. We cannot take them away with us out of this world, but we want to have love and peace.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1595785307718389761) [Octopuses have really fantastic vision](https://www.futurity.org/octopus-eyes-vision-brains-2830482-2/) from Futurity

 > The octopus brain keeps growing and adding new neurons over the animal's lifespan.

At some point, I really need to invest some time into learning about cephalopods.  Everything I hear increases the mystery in pleasing ways.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1596141907993772033) [How Low-Income Voters Shaped The Midterm Elections](https://otherwords.org/how-low-income-voters-shaped-the-midterm-elections/) from OtherWords

 > If you need more than a minimum wage, go vote. If you need to decide between paying for rent or medications, go vote. If you still don't have decent health care or potable water, go vote.

The media consistently fails on these issues, so it gratifies me to finally have organizations working to make the connections between household issues and political policies.  I'd argue that the failure resulted in the inane bashing of Joe Biden from Democrats for saying that voters need to overcome voter suppression.

 > White Antelope and many other chiefs lie there; our women and children lie there. Our lodges were destroyed there, and our horses were taken from us there, and I do not feel disposed to go right off to a new country and leave them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [US Senate Advances Protection for Same-Sex, Interracial Marriages at Federal Level](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-advances-protection-for-same-sex-interracial-marriages-at-federal-level-/6837644.html) from Voice of America

 > Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was reelected last week to represent the Southeastern state of Florida, told cable news network CNN earlier this year the bill was “a stupid waste of time.”

Ah, yes, the obvious platform of "the party of family values":  Refuse to "waste time" ever protecting families.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [What the world would lose with the demise of Twitter: Valuable eyewitness accounts and raw data on human behavior, as well as a habitat for trolls](https://theconversation.com/what-the-world-would-lose-with-the-demise-of-twitter-valuable-eyewitness-accounts-and-raw-data-on-human-behavior-as-well-as-a-habitat-for-trolls-194601) from The Conversation

 > With its massive trove of tweets, Twitter has provided new ways to quantify public discourse and new tools to map aggregate perceptions, and offers a window into large-scale human behavior.

While I do regularly laugh hard at and complain about Twitter for a variety of reasons, the database of tweets still has massive historical value.  I do hope that, should Apartheid Clyde run his new toy into the ground, someone can salvage the tweet and keep them public.
