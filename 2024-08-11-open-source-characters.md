I don't generally bring up holidays unless they fall on the day, but on Tuesday---the thirteenth---the Internet celebrates [Jenny Everywhere Day](https://www.jennyeverywhereday.com/).  I started to mention it in *tomorrow's* developer diary, then that mention grew out of control in an already-enormous post, so I decided to extract it out into its own post, and use the "holiday" as a pretext to talk about somewhat broader issues.

![Line art and colored versions of Jenny](/blog/assets/Jenny-Everywhere-by-PencilInPain.png "We definitely need the scarf...")

Before we get rolling, since this might make me a bunch of enemies, I want to make something clear:  If you like the character, if the character "speaks to you," if you enjoy using the character or any of the "open source characters" that followed in the character's wake, or anything else in that space, I have no argument with you and don't want to change your mind.  The [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub) even covered [a pair of Jenny Everywhere stories]({% post_url 2023-03-18-dhs %}) and a [comic that would have included her]({% post_url 2021-01-30-drift %}), had it run longer.  Rather, in extremely broad terms, I want to make the point that Free Culture only really works when you actually have something substantial to share *and* you have codified rules to work with.

## Overview

Personally, as I've surely mentioned before, I don't really care for the character of Jenny Everywhere.  I don't see a huge problem with the general idea, I guess.  However, the community that created her---Steven Wintle and the members of the Barbalith forums in 2001---gave only the sketchiest background information, plus abilities that feel like they serve the purpose of ensuring that you can't have anything like a plausible continuity in any sense.  I don't know if this description has a public license, but it feels short enough that I can rely on Fair Use to *make the point* that they provided almost nothing in the description.

 > She has short, dark hair. She usually wears aviation goggles on top of her head and a scarf around her neck. Otherwise, she dresses in comfortable clothes. She is average size and has a good body image. She has loads of confidence and charisma. She appears to be Asian or Native American. She has a ready smile.

Does fewer than sixty words make "a character"?  I mean, they couldn't even pick an ethnicity, instead going for the distasteful idea that we can't tell the difference between certain ethnicities, *and* the disinterest in bunches of Asia where people don't look related to the Chinese or distinguishing between Native American groups[^4].

[^4]:  A reader kindly pointed out---to my chagrin, for not noticing it myself while assembling complaints---that this racial description also feels like lazy Orientalism and fetishism, while also making it an implicit part of the licensing deal that creators participate in those problems by choosing Jenny's ethnicity for themselves.  The choice marks the character as "exotic," but in a vague way that suspends the eventual blame for the creators using the character, not the creators *of* the character.

I feel like this established an awful trend, where we got a flood of characters labeled "open source" who didn't have much more to them than a vague premise and sketchy picture, an entire line of literary [stone soups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup) in tin cans that abandons the communal premise of the story *and* of Free Culture.

## What Makes a Character a Character?

Before we go any further, I want to make the point that, legally speaking, we don't really have a concept of a "character" as intellectual property.  We talk about characters informally, but when you look at what laws cover and how court cases shake out, you see that characters come in two parts.

The "important" part comes from the body of knowledge accumulated over the course of stories told about the character.  The lawsuits over Sherlock Holmes seem the most instructive, here.  They never hinge on the presence of the character, but which stories elements of the characters originate in.  [Klinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinger_v._Conan_Doyle_Estate,_Ltd.) tried to argue from the basis of characters, trying to invalidate the copyrights on the then-still-under-copyright stories as "events" in the lives of the characters, rather than changes to the characters.  The [lawsuit over **Enola Holmes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Holmes_%28film%29#Lawsuit) focused on which stories showed the detective acting emotionally.

Critically, though, courts need to find characters [well-delineated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_protection_for_fictional_characters) for those derived works to hold up as...well, derived works.  Classically, in [**The Maltese Falcon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_%28novel%29), Sam Spade didn't qualify as a character, since he largely sits through the plot as it unfolds, and doesn't rate as much more than a stock character when the story focuses on him at all.

And I need to ask, here, does Jenny Everywhere seem well-delineated to anybody?  To put that question another way, without copying the description and somebody's art, could a person construct a character that violates an alleged Jenny Everywhere copyright?  As I look at it, unless all revelations about the character by different authors in their stories become a part of the character, I don't think that anybody could manage to pull it off.

The less interesting part of a character, from our perspective, comes from trademark law.  The trick to [using Mickey Mouse]({% post_url 2024-01-28-mouse %})'s public domain appearances in a non-Disney story involves making it absolutely clear to all parties that Disney does not endorse your work and that you don't seek to trade on Disney's reputation[^1].  A trademark serves as exactly what it sounds like it does, a "mark in trade" or a brand.  Almost every character that you can think of wanting to "pirate" from a corporate property has a trademark attached to it, whether registered or common law, because (for example) publishing a Superman story strongly suggests that you have an association with Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment, or at least want to ride on the recognition and popularity that they have built for the character over almost ninety years.

[^1]:  The latter issue probably has a lot to do with why we haven't seen much of the long-promised "flowering of creativity" with Mickey Mouse in the public domain.  The mouse only holds any interest *to the extent* that it feels like the author has taken an audience away from Disney.  I've said it before, but I really do get the sense that Mickey only interests anti-copyright activists or anybody else because of the strong Disney trademark.

Again, this has less to do with our aim in this post, since nobody claims Jenny Everywhere as a trademark, but since the two aspects of character can supplement each other---Sam Spade might not have strong delineation, but if the character becomes so associated with a brand that using them implies the brand, that delineates the character in a different way---it seemed worth raising the point.

## The License

I already alluded to some of this, above, but consider the [thread where Barbalith created Jenny Everywhere](https://web.archive.org/web/20090325192211/http://www.barbelith.com/topic.php?id=5491#post86062).  Of that material, what do you *actually* have permission to use?  Somebody later in the thread asserts that she likes toast.  Implausible as that sounds as a favorite food, does it *count*?  If I read somebody's story where Jenny recounts her childhood, would *that* count?

Instead, the character carries a non-license that doesn't tell you the rights granted to you, may not fit with any other license, and seems to prefer that authors using the character *not* collaborate or release their work under a Free license at all, and that overall concept has always frustrated me.

For those who haven't seen it before, the license-paragraph reads as follows.

 > The character of Jenny Everywhere is available for use by anyone, with only one condition. This paragraph must be included in any publication involving Jenny Everywhere, in order that others may use this property as they wish. All rights reversed.

And that means...what, exactly?  No, seriously, let's take this step by step.  We'll skip the initial noun phrase---"the character of Jenny Everywhere"---since I hammered that to pieces above.

### What Does It Even Mean to "Use" a Character?

This sounds like an abstract question, but did I use the character for this post?  If wrote another post listing characters who travel the multiverse, would that count?  If I wrote a story where a character mentions that "Jenny" hasn't returned from a trip to [Parallel Universe Number BiG-5604-POOP-4]({% post_url 2022-07-23-banjo-2 %}), and we never see who they referred to, would *that* count?  What if, much later in the story, Jenny shows up with an entirely different description?  And what if the names and powers only overlap accidentally, given the popularity of the name Jennifer?

Now, combine this with my concerns above about whether this even genuinely creates a character, and think about where the boundaries might lie.

Again, I realize that it sounds excessively abstract or hair-splitting, but if we don't all come up with the same answers to questions like these, then any case involving the character that makes it to a court would almost certainly set a terrible precedent, because the judge in that case would probably disagree with all of us.

### Conditions Apply

We then "must" include the paragraph in a "publication involving Jenny Everywhere."  And we have a new verb.  Does involvement coincide with use?  It sounds more general, though.  Publishing, at least, has a well-understood definition[^2] of committed to a fixed form and offered for the public to experience.

[^2]:  Well, we *mostly* understand the definition of publishing.  A range of possibilities exist between keeping your work private and widespread distribution.  If an author prints up a handful of copies of a book and sells them to people who they already know, that might not qualify as publication.  Again, that sounds contrived, but one situation that we probably all take for granted hinges entirely on how a randomly selected judge would decide that gray area, old television episodes.  You can find many websites claiming to have a list of episodes of television shows that lost copyright protection because they aired without a copyright notice when Congress still required that for publications.  However, whenever studios have sued the companies that make the episodes available, they (the studios) have claimed that they have the television stations as customers, not viewers, and since they can enumerate every television station at the time, and expected each station to return its print of each episode, they didn't actually "publish" the episode until it came out on home media.

And now the real questions start showing up.  Assuming that this blog post involves Jenny Everywhere in addition to using the character, did my quoting the paragraph above fulfill my obligation?  It feels to me like it shouldn't, in spirit, because it stands far apart from the credits below, and I quoted it for the purpose of inspecting the parts, not as licensing.  But it definitely (if barely and mostly accidentally) follows the literal instructions of inclusion in the publication.

If I "use" or "involve" multiple characters under these terms, do I need to repeat the paragraph for each character, or do I have permission to consolidate them into a single paragraph naming the list of characters?  Almost opposite the previous question, it feels like consolidation fits the spirit of the requirements, but doing so would violate the instructions as-written, because "this paragraph" only names a single character, and it provides no guidance for multiple characters.

Then, we have the enforcement end of this.  If somebody decided to sue me for using a name and a scarf somewhere in a way that they didn't approve of, would a judge say that this paragraph protects me from that lawsuit?

### Reversals of ~~Fortune~~ Rights

Let's go a few steps further.  If we have indeed [reversed copyright](https://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/allrightsreserved/)---see the second-to-last section, "The phrase by itself is not enough; a license must explicitly state the rights that are granted"---does that mean that I can theoretically sue Wintle for infringing on my alleged reversed right to create a similar character first?  That *seems* like the opposite of copyright.  Does it imply a copyleft regime granting everybody the same rights as the creator, provided that they extend that license to others on our work?

The phrase appears to originate with [**The Principia Discordia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia), with the following line at the end.

 > Ⓚ All Rites Reversed --- Reprint what you like

With [rite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rite) (religious custom) substituted for *right*, it still has no legal meaning, but "reprint what you like" seems to provide enough permission and guidance to understand most of their intent[^3].

[^3]:  Again, we can't guarantee that common understanding, though.  People have treated the book as fully in the public domain, even though "reprint what you like" strongly suggests that we only have permission to extract verbatim sections for future publications.  I don't know what to tell you...

After that, the [Free Software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) previously used the phrasing "Copyleft---all rights reversed."  Realizing that the phrase has no meaning, however, their licenses outline exactly how the rights work in (for example) the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).  And given the similar insertion of another (not legally binding) pseudo-copyright symbol, 🄯 in this case, I assume that this situation took inspiration directly from the other.

This indicates the problem.  When I ask what that phrase implies here, I use the verb "imply," because it has no legal meaning to state anything explicitly.  You can't have a license of *vibes*.

### Speaking of Copyleft...

This gets to something that I've gestured at before:  What does Jenny Everywhere entail, as a character?  You have two broad possibilities, here.  First, the character available under this license includes precisely what little that you might scrape up as offered in that original thread, presumably plus whatever individual authors have released under licenses that you can use.

Alternatively, maybe they wanted to imply that all writers agree to extend the character, in maybe-contradictory ways, regardless of how or even if they license their stories.

Contradictory as it sounds, I have to disagree with *both* interpretations.  The initial description of the character doesn't seem to have enough information to qualify for any reasonable copyright protection to extend a license for, but the "license" gives absolutely no indication that it wants contributors to share anything.

A related question, how does this license interact with actual copyleft licenses?  For example, the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 international](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license says the following in §3(b)1.

 > You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on...Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

Near the end of §10, the GPL v3 similarly says this.

 > You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.

Doesn't "include this paragraph for the character" apply an "additional condition" or "further restriction" on adapted material, beyond what the major copyleft licenses impose?  And both licenses (rightly) say that, if you have requirements that conflict with the license, then you can't use the license.

### Why This All Matters

The "license" has the virtue of packing what it wants to say in only forty words, but it doesn't really tell us what the copyright owner gives us, nor does it sufficiently explain our responsibilities, *and* it adds extra words that have no accepted legal meaning, plus some that seem to pad the word count.  And if we don't know what a license actually means, then it makes no sense to use content provided *under* that license, because we can't know what we've agreed to.

Honestly, I get it.  We have a culture that grumps about "legalese" and despises involvement by any lawyers.  But we get the verbose, seemingly redundant explanations flooding licenses and other legal documents, because these sorts of informal licenses put us in a situation where a disagreement can quickly grow out of control, when everybody has a legitimate but wildly different interpretation of the intent, and potentially high stakes.

Compare this situation with the Creative Commons licenses, at least the Free Culture subset of them.  We all have a good intuitive understanding of the general concept of each license, but we can also read through the full text to determine how to deal with any edge-cases.  And we can do this, because their lawyers tried to think of every weird case that could break the license or force participants to do something that made no sense.

## Where Does This Leave Us

Again, I don't want to tell anybody not to enjoy the character, not to use the character, or whatever.  However, I do want people to think carefully about these issues, if you'd like to use the character for some project.  If nothing else, we should respect the project that popularized "open source" for fiction.

By my reading of things, admittedly a personal and non-legal reading, everything feels so vague that it would give a malicious person---somebody claiming to have participated in the creation of the character---standing to sue people for copyright infringement.  It also appears to cause conflicts with the major copyleft licenses.  As such, while I won't advise anybody to *not* use the character, if they want to do so, I'd definitely advise caution in doing so.

And so, err...happy Jenny Everywhere Day on Tuesday?  Yeah, sorry to end on a downer...

Although alternatives do exist.  I won't name names, yet, to encourage people to explore, but a multiversal operation spans multiple novels in the public domain, Fictopedia has a related idea, and a similarly sketchy character exists under a more civilized license in a repository of heroines.  Maybe I'll try to wedge the parent project of the last into the book club, at some point, if I can find enough narrative threads to pull.
