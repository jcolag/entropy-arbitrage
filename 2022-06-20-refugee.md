Today we celebrate [World Refugee Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Refugee_Day), honoring refugees from around the world.  These days, it feels like we can't do better than spare refugees an occasional thought, and realize that we all live one disaster---artificial or natural---away from needing to hope that someone overseas can take us in.

...And now I don't have a segue.  On the other hand, I also don't have much to report, since I spent a large chunk of the week working with unfortunate plumbing issues.

Though in addition to World Refugee Day, today marks the legal observance of (yesterday) [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) in the United States, and tomorrow morning marks the [summer solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice) in the Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for the long-neglected [**Slack Backup**](https://github.com/jcolag/SlackBackup) and its predecessor [**slackup**](https://github.com/jcolag/slackup).  Note that **Slack Backup** could still use an overhaul to bring it up to date with OAuth authentication and a modern version of Electron.  Most likely, that work won't come from me, since I no longer visit any Slack groups, and have let my tokens expire, so this project no longer serves any purpose for me.

## Next

I'll repeat again, "I want to get back to **Salavi**, which probably means ignoring the desired animation, for the moment." ðŸ¤ž My improvised scanner also needs a rebuild, so I hope to have the time to cut new legs to the thing and get a picture for next week.
