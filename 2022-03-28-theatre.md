Yesterday, people celebrated [World Theatre Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Theatre_Day), an event promoting live theater.  They obviously have a harder sell during a pandemic---in fact, I wrote about the issues in [large indoor audiences]({% post_url 2020-07-05-pmedia %}) and how we might improve on them---but theater still represents an important part of any culture.

My projects are generally less dramatic, though.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The JSON-formatting code for my static-checkers didn't work out quite right, with the most egregious issue probably that they relied on receiving the input in one update.  Normally, this wouldn't create a problem, since the input JSON doesn't generally have *too* much in it, but the potential for a problem exists, so now the code saves all the input to finally process when the input ends.

If you spend time as a JavaScript person who writes command-line applications like this, the correct setup looks something like the following.

```javascript
process.stdin.on('data', (more) => {
  // The "data" event announces that the program can read from
  // the standard input stream.  The "more" parameter provides the
  // input to read, which might not cover the entire input.
});
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
  // The "end" event announces that the process has no more to read
  // from standard input.
});
```

In the case of structured input like JSON, we can't process intermediate `more` pieces, so the code needs to concatenate them until the system raises the `end` event.

I only have a prototype, really, but I also added code to add an *approximate* line number to [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)'s output.  On its own, it provides an offset into the file, which isn't convenient for finding a subtle issue.  I say that it provides an "approximate line," because---somehow---having JavaScript count the characters in each line to compare with the offset does *not* work correctly, and the error doesn't skew the results predictably.  This will need more investigation, but I at least have a start.

Less interesting, I edited the text inserted into the Friday posts.

## GitHub Profile

{% github jcolag/jcolag %}

The "joys" of working with the modern Internet...

I happened to look over my GitHub profile, the other day, and noticed that the [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) link didn't have the image associated with it.  The remote image *existed*, but it wouldn't show up on GitHub.

Digging deeper, it looks like Buy Me a Coffee's CDN now hides itself behind Cloudflare.  This protection means that browsers can get at it directly, but indirect methods---like `wget` or GitHub---quietly fail.

I don't like this solution at all, but at least for the duration, I have moved the logo into the repository, rather than referring to it remotely.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Generic Board Game**](https://github.com/jcolag/generic-board-game), [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), [**RenewDB**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Miniboost**](https://github.com/jcolag/Miniboost), and [**VS Code Rat**](https://github.com/jcolag/vscode-rat).

## Next

Chances are, I'll continue with the library updates, though I have a small handful of other issues to deal with at some point, and a human-generated pull request that has gotten lost between the cracks, because GitHub doesn't provide notifications for those...
