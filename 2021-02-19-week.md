As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > For communities with moderate transmission rates, the model suggests testing everyone every two weeks and isolating positive cases for one week.

It's really infuriating that we're still trying to nibble around the edges of the pandemic, instead of just shutting down the country for a month and paying to make that work.  One time, across the board, and the virus is effectively dead.  This is a reasonable attempt to find some optimal "sweet spot," but we wouldn't need it if officials took this seriously months ago.

 > America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers, and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.

 > In 2020 Christopher Lischewski, the former president and CEO of Bumblebee Foods, was convicted of conspiracy to fix prices of canned tuna.

Through most of the twentieth century, monopoly positions were usually granted to utilities in exchange for *forcing* them to extend equal service to all parts of the country.  Deregulation (by Republicans) has increased the number of industries where areas effectively live with monopolies, but that market position doesn't come with any responsibility to serve the community.

Speaking of monopolies, one of the places where they put in the most effort is driving down wages, because they know full well that you can't get a billion dollars---let alone a *trillion* dollars---without exploiting large numbers of people.

 > No, the election wasn’t stolen by Democrats. No, the Capitol rioters weren’t a false flag operation. No, QAnon isn’t real.

It's worth pointing out that, not long ago, Congressional aides were asked to [sign a letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/congress-trump-impeachment.html) to the Senate calling for Donald Trump's impeachment.  Not a single Republican aide was willing to put their name to it.  So, I need to question how serious this aide is.

 > By essentially price-setting and thereby benchmarking payments for the great majority of health services, the government would become the Sam’s Club of health care, which would drive prices down.

I wonder what happened to all those people, claiming to be progressives, who screamed that Biden had some corporate-run health care plan.  You'd think that they might be applauding this, instead of...whatever they're doing.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The Far-Right Has Deep Roots in New York Comedy](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8j4k/alt-right-new-york-comedy-new-republic) from VICE

 > ...a constellation of online and offline spaces catering to comics and comedy fans with an interest in "transgressive" speech in the 2000s and 2010s—spaces with a track-record of incubating hateful rhetoric...

I'd argue that a lot of comedy has this same profile, whether it's painted as "just speaking truth" (even though it's clearly not the truth), a reaction to society moving too fast, or some level of (alleged) irony.  Consider someone like George Carlin, who was brilliant and obviously cared about making the world a better place, but so much of his act was a warning to withdraw from institutions and to introduce false equivalencies between people who want progress and people who want to return to the nineteenth century.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Turkey reins in social media---one platform at a time](https://globalvoices.org/2021/02/11/turkey-reins-in-social-media-one-platform-at-a-time/) from Global Voices

 > The law came as swiftly as the detentions of social media users allegedly behind the insults.

This is almost surely a sign of the sort of action that we narrowly averted in this country, but also what we might need to deal with if the far-right continues to hold power.
