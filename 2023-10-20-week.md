As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:07 -- Mon 16 October 2023

 > These gangs prowled the streets in automobiles and attacked African Americans, burned black homes and businesses, and kept the fires of racial violence inflamed for days. They blamed Black men for invading their communities.

Note that this doesn't even count how many immigrant communities "became white" by identifying with hatred of Black neighbors, or the local insurrections during Reconstruction, when white people attacked their town and county governments, because some Black people got elected.

 > Brazil has led rankings of violence against trans people for years, and registered 273 killings of LGBTQ+ people in 2022, according to a report by the Observatory of Deaths and Violence against LGBTI+ in Brazil.

Hashtags:  #Brazil #LGBT #Refugees

This article makes the interesting point that, despite the danger to refugees---especially of gender and sexual minorities---Brazil has become a destination, because it stands out by at least offering legal protection to them.

This doesn't provide too many specifics, unfortunately, but at least sounds promising.

 > We are like vessels tossed on the bosom of the deep; our passions are the winds that sweep us impetuously forward; each pleasure is a rock; the whole life is a wide ocean. Reason is the pilot to guide us, but often allows itself to be led astray by the storms of pride.

I feel like I say this a lot, here, but you really *should* notice how unstoppable right-wing movements look...until people stop tolerating them.

Hashtags:  #Twitter #SocialMedia #NPR

I sometimes think back to somewhere around 1994, when I sat around with a group of fellow then-young developers, and we sketched out a broad vision for a service that we'd all later see as social media.  It would consist of a directory to find people, a messaging system, and a public-facing web-page where people could post updates.  Why have you never heard of this project?  Someone in the group---it *sounds* like me, but I don't want to accidentally take credit for someone else's idea based only on that---pointed out that (a) we already had this in e-mail and the web, (b) the parts that the Internet doesn't have (like a directory of all users) felt prone to abuse, and (c) it would cost a fortune to run, if it became successful, with no non-abusive or even sustainable business model.  As such, we threw the idea away, knowing that none of these companies would last long.  It looks like we had it right...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > They had all been subject to microaggressions â€“ insidious, often subtle, verbal, behavioral or environmental slights â€“ in relation to their hair. These comments can be both intentional and unintentional, but they always convey hostile, derogatory or negative attitudes toward stigmatized or culturally marginalized groups.

Honestly, it stuns me that this happens at all, let alone that it *still* happens.  Other than "your hair looks nice," I actually have trouble imagining having something to say about someone's hair, and *certainly* don't want to touch it...

We have more important things going on in the world, at the moment, *but* you can generally tell the quality of a national regime by its political prisoners.  When "anti-war stickers" make an enemy of the state, you have *serious* problems...
