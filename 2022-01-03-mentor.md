Probably because people are still hung over from the New Year, today's holidays are fairly bland.  January, however, is [National Mentoring Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mentoring_Month) in the United States.  I happen to hate the modern transactional view of mentoring, the sort that leads to young people on social media---often coming from privilege---asking where they get their mentor.  However, helping young people improve their lives and making it clear that someone is in their corner *never* goes out of style.

Otherwise, welcome to the first [developer journal](/blog/tag/devjournal) post of the year.

## Pull Requests

Without many new issues in mind, this week's "GitHub time" went to merging pull requests that I apparently lost track of.  They included [**Ham Newsletter**](https://github.com/jcolag/ham-newsletter), [**Chroma Schemer**](https://github.com/jcolag/chroma-schemer), [**Small Things**](https://github.com/jcolag/SmallThings), and--from an actual human, rather than a bot, so thank you, [stasoid](https://github.com/stasoid)---the [**Wierd**](https://github.com/jcolag/Wierd/commits/master) programming language interpreter.

## GitHub Page

Because I have no idea if anybody ever visits [the page](http://jcolag.github.io/) itself, I also updated my [GitHub landing page](https://github.com/jcolag/jcolag.github.io) repository that I set up years ago and forgot about.  Now, it's up to date, though it's still not particularly useful.

## Next

I'm inclined to say "more of the same," again, because I still have other things to do.  However, I needed to make some changes to the blog and mailing list code over the weekend, so those should start going out soon.
