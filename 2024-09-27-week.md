As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The Mangrove, a restaurant in Notting Hill owned by the activist Frank Crichlow, was a meeting place for the Caribbean community of West London. It was victimized and raided by the Notting Hill police and Harrow Road police on several occasions. The raids were purported to be about illegal drugs, but no charges were ever brought because nothing was found. It was, for all purposes, police racist bias.

Granted, I've never had much interest in the UK, but it still baffles me that I've never heard of this before.

 > Decisions about whether a student should be held back often rely on measures such as standardized test scores. But research shows there‚Äôs a long history of racial bias in these tests, which tend to favor white, Asian and higher-income students.

Hashtags:  #Education #Inequality

It bothers me that, at least anecdotally, we more or less knew most of the issues listed in the article when I still attended school.  While I appreciate the data, I definitely don't appreciate that we've made no progress in decades.

 > There‚Äôs another issue in the school system, which is standardized tests. Teachers focus so much time and energy in teaching students how to pass tests that they‚Äôre not able to educate them. So our students are over-tested and under-educated.

 > ...one of the biggest barriers to transforming the carceral state is that gap in lived experience. For most Americans, our image of incarceration is constantly obscured by government rhetoric, punitive traditions of justice, pop culture and the walls themselves. With the onset of COVID, that obscuring effect only grew worse.

Hashtags:  #Prison #Abolition

I try to make the point that we can't fix issues with these systems if we can't even agree on what they're *for*.  In the case of prisons, if we don't have any other plan, they become a place where we "stockpile" people who we don't want to deal with, which utterly fails them and society.  That pushed me in favor of abolition, personally.

 > The move is unusual in that LinkedIn appears to have gone ahead with training AI on its users‚Äô data, even creating a new option in its settings, without updating its terms of service, which is traditionally one of the main documents that can explain how users‚Äô data is collected or used.

This could go in some pretty funny directions, considering how much LinkedIn posts I see that the "author" blatantly copied out of a ChatGPT session...

 > Despite the fact that more than 80 percent of Democratic, independent, and Republican voters want to raise the minimum wage, no Republican-led legislature has passed a genuine increase in decades. Many have not only blocked state wage increases, but also passed punitive ‚Äúpreemption‚Äù laws to prevent cities from stepping in to ensure fair wages. Not coincidentally, many of these are among the most gerrymandered.

Coincidentally, we also need to fix our democracy for other reasons, so...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > But worse, Vance knows full well that those immigrants are here legally, and he knows full well that his continued smears of them have dangerous consequences, with bomb threats, school and building closures, and a general atmosphere of fear throughout immigrant communities across the country.

He *also* knows that making the streets dangerous will reduce the number of people willing to go out and vote, so let's not pretend that he doesn't have a plan with these absurd racist lies.

This makes a lot of sense, given my own experience.

 > Through her work, Ebrahimpour defies the societal red lines surrounding the depiction of women, creating a visual language of resistance and redefining the possibilities for artistic freedom in Iran.

This feels like a "human interest" story tuned for my interests, lacking only preservation of a dying language...
