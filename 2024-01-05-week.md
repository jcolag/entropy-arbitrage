As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Intellectual humility isn‚Äôt lacking conviction; you can believe something strongly until your mind is changed, and you believe something else. It also isn‚Äôt being wishy-washy. You should have a high bar for what evidence you require to change your mind.

Hashtags:  #Psychology #Humility

The article admittedly does that obnoxious thing of insisting that we open-minded people should approach fraught political issues with curiosity and a desire to learn, rather than dismissing the idea that certain people don't deserve human rights out of hand.  However, *other* than that---presumably necessary in the author's world, given that he mentions growing up with a white evangelical family---it makes some good points.

 > The employer didn‚Äôt care. Anyone who didn‚Äôt want to work could leave. But if we left our job there, where could we find a job during Covid-19? Making demands was like banging your head against the wall. It was pointless, because we got nothing.

I've mentioned this before, but I highly encourage people to learn the skills required to make the least-complicated things that you use in your life.  Once you try your hand at it, you'll quickly realize that the price that you pay in stores doesn't match the value of the labor, meaning that someone must get cheated.  This article introduces you to a few such people.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/111687437273692561)

 > Say not "a small event!" Why "small"? / Costs it more pain that this ye call / A "great event" should come to pass / From that? Untwine me from the mass / Of deeds which make up life, one deed / Power shall fall short in or exceed!

You know, I'd *almost* suggest that the political far-right hates libraries so much, because their predecessors at libraries helped defeat a prior generation of fascists, and authoritarians love little more than holding a pointless grudge.  But then I remembered that authoritarians also hate reading and learning about history, so the idea that they know this particular story seems pretty laughable...

 > What should people do if they believe someone in their social circle seems lonely? Try to be warm and supportive to that individual, but in a way that goes beyond hugs. Help them understand they have some control and choice in their lives, Ybarra says.

Hashtags:  #Loneliness #Belonging

This reflects some studies that I've seen suggesting that people with "passion projects" don't generally feel lonely.

You really only need to know one thing to make sense of politics in the United States:  One political party campaigns on the idea that government doesn't help people, and when people elect them, they try to make that true.  Once you see that, just about everything---except why we continue to treat them as a legitimate political party---falls into place.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why Prusa is floundering, and how you can avoid their fate](https://drewdevault.com/2023/12/26/2023-12-26-Prusa-is-floundering.html) from Drew DeVault's Blog

 > Prusa‚Äôs early foothold in the market was strong, and they were wise to execute the way they did early on. But they absolutely had to diversify their lines of business. Prusa left gaping holes in the market and utterly failed to capitalize on any of them.

My original comments, here, started talking about how this idea might explain a lot about the problems with people not paying attention to Free Culture.  But then I realized that I had written a few hundred words on the topic.  As such, I'll leave you to check out the interesting story now, but a week from Sunday, expect a full post on the subject.

## Follow Me

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
