## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Gambit part 2

Since we [left off last time]({% post_url 2025-06-19-gambit-part-1 %}), while the phaser blast crossed the space between ships, the **DS9** crew dealt with the (more or less) abduction of one of their own, in *Invasive Procedures*.

 > **DATA**: That is true. But in those situations, you were acting as Head of Security, not as First Officer. The primary role of the second in command is to carry out the decisions of the Captain in this case, me.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **DATA**: Yes. But once I have made a decision, it is your job to carry it out regardless of how you may personally feel. Any further objections should be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. I do not recall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with his captain as you did a moment ago.

Two things, here.  First, this seems like as clear an indication as we've seen that Starfleet policy looks a lot like "sit down and shut up" for most officers.  Episodes like [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}) have hinted that they don't have any obligation or standing to reject an immoral order, but this says it fairly explicitly.  They have a strict hierarchy, and their view of leadership involves enforcing that hierarchy by any means necessary, including these sorts of angry outbursts.

Second, Riker has treated others in authority at least that badly, in [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %}) and [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}).  He also committed multiple murders in [*Up the Long Ladder*]({% post_url 2023-03-23-up-long-ladder %}) which I assume defied some order or other, considered shooting the captain (along with everybody else) in [*Power Play*]({% post_url 2024-08-22-power-play %}), ignored his orders to go on a rogue mission in [*The Outcast*]({% post_url 2024-09-05-outcast %}), and probably spent a lot of the first couple of seasons fuming that Picard didn't do whatever he suggested.  All that to say that Commander Manbaby has definitely publicly showed irritation with his captain.

Actually, let's toss in a third thing, which requires you to imagine the tone of a stern parent:  If Commander Riker had jumped off a bridge, would Data expect Worf to do it, too?  Even ignoring how Data has sanitized Riker's image, I don't think that we've heard anything nearly as chilling from this franchise (yet) as this peer pressure nonsense of  angrily insisting that everybody use the boot-licker as their role-model, specifically because of the boot-licking.

 > **WORF**: Sir, it is I who has jeopardized our friendship, not you. If you will overlook this incident, I would like to continue to consider you my friend.

By contrast, you'll notice that Worf realizes that he did the worst possible thing for a Starfleet officer:  He hurt the boss's ego and shattered the illusion that they operate as a happy 1950s sitcom family.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, what a tangled web we weave. I have difficulty remembering whose side I'm on. So, what have you been able to find out?

Did this episode accidentally expose Picard as a poser?  I ask, because Picard quotes [*Marmion:  A Tale of Flodden Field*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_%28poem%29) by Walter Scott, the line "Oh, what a tangled web we weave,/ When first we practice to deceive."  I find the line telling, because people often misattribute it to Shakespeare, Picard's favorite author, despite the lines having eight syllables (iambic tetrameter) instead of ten (iambic pentameter).

Might Picard also enjoy Scott?  Sure.  Might the problem lie with writers who didn't bother to source the quote instead of Picard?  Sure.  But we've established in episodes such as [*Where Silence Has Lease*]({% post_url 2022-12-01-silence-lease %}) that the Federation also teaches the myth that people believed in a Flat Earth prior to Christopher Columbus, so it doesn't seem out of the question---especially given that he only ever quotes the most famous (or fastest to find) lines of *anything*---that he assumes that the line comes from one of Shakespeare's less-popular plays that he hasn't read.

 > **PICARD**: A second artifact? Oh, by the way, that first artifacts is not Romulan. It's Vulcan.

Given that the Romulans started out as a Vulcan splinter-group, this feels like an attempt at denying that Romulans have *any* history, let alone one shared with people who they know.  I mean, surely, both cultures can and should claim "Vulcan" artifacts older than a certain age as part of their heritage.

Similarly, I can't help noticing how quickly this shifted from blaming the Romulans for yet another implausible scheme to sweeping it under the carpet so that they can all move on with the plot.  It so often feels like the show desperately wants to expose that obnoxious paranoia in scenes like this, with a deadly plot around every corner, but never talking about it again once disproven.

 > **TALLERA**: Very well. To answer your question, for several years now, there has been a small but growing movement of extreme isolationists on Vulcan. A group that believes contact with alien races has polluted our culture and is destroying Vulcan purity. This group advocates the total isolation of Vulcan from the rest of the galaxy and the eradication of all alien influences from our planet.

We've seen that the Federation feels extremely fragile through a lot of the series, with hints especially early on that the government doesn't have the political capital to do anything controversial.  This seems to suggest that the sentiment has reached "important" planets like Vulcan, too.

Also, as a change from prior episodes treating Picard like some kind of celebrity, T'Paan doesn't recognize him at all...but also mostly shrugs her shoulders and accepts his importance because he says so.

 > **TALLERA**: Agreed. But extremists often have a logic all their own.

This sounds profound, but by quickly expanding from isolationists to the vague "extremists," it only means that they feel comfortable dismissing anybody offering an idea outside the current [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window)...

 > **PICARD**: You were much as my people once were. Savage, warlike.

Note the past tense, here, Picard once again asserting that humans previously had violent tendencies, but certainly don't today.  And he denies an interest in war, despite his rambling about "a kick in our complacency" when meeting the Borg in [*Q Who?*]({% post_url 2023-03-09-q-who %}) and the eventual war with them, the crew's discomfort with a peaceful Romulan encounter in [*The Defector*]({% post_url 2023-07-06-defector %}), the war with the Cardassians revealed in [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}), among other episodes where they all but openly crave a war...

 > **KORAL**: Koral.

You'd need something of a specific set of interests to recognize Koral after all these years of history fading into the distance, but if you do, it might have something to do with NBA star ["Big Game James" Worthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Worthy), then recently retired from the LA Lakers, playing him.  They don't play it up, but you'll notice when he shows up on the *Enterprise* that he towers over everything, including the doorways.

 > **DATA**: However, if Koral wishes to contest our actions he can file a protest with the Judge Advocate General's office. Bring the shuttle aboard. Then you and Doctor Crusher can begin the inspection.

I know that people think that I exaggerate when I talk about the authoritarian strain of this show, but abusing health and safety regulations to justify a blatantly illegal search of a foreign national's property---and playing it off as a fun solution---sits squarely inside the authoritarian playbook, including suggesting that the victim file a complaint with a busy government office *after* doing the damage.  It definitely doesn't help the optics of that, when they go that far out of their way to victimize a character played by a Black man.

Also, notice Data's little jousting for dominance, here, dismissing Worf's (illegal) plan, so that he can turn around and present it as his idea.

 > **TROI**: He's all right. He's only stunned.
 >
 > **DATA**: I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation.

Don't you *dare* suggest that he has emotions, though...

 > **PICARD**: Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that those artifacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you down on the surface. As soon as she's got those artifacts, she'll leave you behind to be captured by Starfleet.

In watching this, I can't help feeling sorry for Saavik.  This makes the second time---following [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %})---that the story almost certainly started with Saavik returning in a morally ambiguous role, only for somebody to panic and replace the character with a one-off copy, so that we wouldn't need to worry about "choosing sides" or implying that any major characters might have a problem with the Federation.  That doesn't even mention how the writers wanted to eventually reveal that she remained on Vulcan at the end of [**The Voyage Home**]({% post_url 2022-04-07-tvh %}) because of her pregnancy by Spock.  This time, the idea presumably got far enough down the production pipeline that they even cast Robin Curtis as a remarkably similar character...

 > **TALLERA**: That is all I could manage. I suggest you take it and leave.

Notice that, with all the technology at their disposal, Vulcans---and probably individuals in general---can't manifest arbitrary amounts of money.

 > **PICARD**: You'll never get away with this. Starfleet will never stand and watch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the Federation.

While unofficial sources had always declared that Vulcan helped found the Federation, I don't believe that anybody had specified it in an official production before this.

 > **PICARD**: Think, Tallera. Two thousand years ago your people were being consumed by war. But when peace came to Vulcan, the resonator became useless. That's why it was dismantled.

This also gives us a rough data point for Vulcan history.

 > Captain's log, stardate 47169.2. Security Minister Satok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest of the isolationists.

Whoa, there.  Two items of apparent relevance, here.  First, Picard calls her by her Romulan alias instead of T'Paan, the Vulcan name that she gave him, which presumably indicated her actual identity, especially now that we've definitely identified her as Vulcan.  I initially only wanted to call that odd, but thinking about it, it makes it sound like he wants to frame this dissident group as the result of [foreign agitators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_agitator) to dismiss its validity, as in denying her legitimate identity entirely to paint her as a foreigner.

As if on cue to help me with this point, in fact, you only need to look back about two weeks to find the Trump administration trying to use the [presence of foreign flags](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/foreign-flags-los-angeles-protests) to smear protests as a covert invasion by foreign governments.  You'll also notice how the political right-wing plays up exotic names when dealing with political opponents, to associate them with some foreign origin, probably most prominently over the last couple of decades, "Barack *Hussein* Obama," as if a couple of syllables mean anything about fitness for service.

And maybe related, "a search for the rest of the isolationists" seems to suggest that nobody sees a problem rounding up and arresting people based on their political beliefs.  In [*The Hunted*]({% post_url 2023-07-13-hunted %}), Picard didn't offer asylum to a clear political prisoner, and this suggests that it may have gone down that way because the Federation doesn't have a problem with the concept.

 > **PICARD**: Satok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Normally, I would be the first one to agree, but perhaps some things are best left in the past.

...Unbelievable.  The amateur archaeologist always on the hunt for ancient weapons finds something not only of incredible power, but a potent and critical symbol of exactly the thing that he *claims* to fight for, but nah, let's toss it in a trash compactor.

No, really.  The thing eliminates the need for violence in self-defense and strongly encourages people to find peaceful solutions to their problems.  If Picard genuinely believes that the Federation has evolved past the need for violence, he doesn't condone violence, and doesn't see Starfleet as a military organization, then this seems like the best possible weapon/defense system to have around.  It would not only protect Federation citizens, but would also illustrate and embody the Federation's alleged principles.

For an example that we'll soon need to return to anyway, consider how a lot of this show would shake out with a device like this central to their defense.  They never need to worry about an attack.  They can stop worrying about whether creatures like Q secretly mean to harm them.  And they save people by making friends of them.

 > **DATA**: If we are to adhere to the exact letter of Starfleet regulations, then technically, sir, you have been declared a renegade. In fact, I believe you are facing twelve counts of court-martial offenses. You cannot give orders either, sir.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: Data, he was joking. You know that, right? Data?

I can never tell if they *intended* it, but I have to appreciate that this story has almost come full circle.  Other than the opening bar scene in [part one]({% post_url 2025-06-19-gambit-part-1 %}), we started this mess with Riker voicing his support for corruption.  Nearly two episodes later, we see him try to squirm out of the consequences of deserting his post, committing crimes, and attacking a Starfleet vessel multiple times, including (as Data put it) "assault, theft, piracy, and treason."

Mind you, I don't think that Starfleet would or should *discharge* him, at least not for anything that he does with Baran's ship, but he should presumably face a court-martial to defend his actions.  Either he did the right thing and can stand by those actions, or he did something wrong and should take any reprimand to heart, **if** he thinks of himself as having an honest role in a system where actions have consequences.

## Conclusions

We get some hints of literature beyond Shakespeare---though possibly presumed his works---and Vulcan history, I suppose.

### The Bad

We continue to see the Federation's authoritarian strain, where people with lower status have an obligation to carry out directions without question no matter their objections.  Likewise, they don't talk about insubordination when somebody more powerful does it.  As in many other episodes, people with lower status solve problems by buttering up the boss, while bosses need to take credit for useful ideas.  In some cases, asserting that one has authority seems close enough for people to trust you with sensitive information.  And the episode ends with an argument over whether the rules should apply to the powerful at all.

Similarly, they reinterpret minor regulations to weaponize them against minority groups, asserting that the aggrieved parties can always file a formal complaint about authorities suspending their civil liberties.

We also see more anti-Romulan sentiment, even as the episode shifts the focus away from them.  They seem to dismiss the idea that the Romulans have a long history that they share with their Vulcan ancestors.  Once they identify their artifacts as Vulcan, they drop all mention of the Romulans in a single line, rather than admitting a paranoid error.  And they identify Vulcan dissidents by Romulan aliases.

Meanwhile, Picard continues to peddle the idea that the days of humans participating in war have long passed, despite the show's extensive evidence to the contrary.

The episode also provides more evidence of the Federation's fragility and authoritarianism, with nationalistic factions popping up wishing to withdraw even worlds that command some respect.  And we also see evidence that the Federation routinely arrests ideological dissenters, dismissing them as having an incompatible form of logic or literally hunting them down for disagreeing with current policy.

People see no issues with destroying critical elements of cultural heritage, if somebody could use it to endanger lives.

### The Weird

At least for ordinary people, they can't use replicators or other technology to raise large amounts of capital.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Data dreams up a crime spree, in *Phantasms*.
