* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Before we get rolling, congratulations to Minnesotans for organizing a *second* general strike, guilting even the people who would rather follow specific rules on when to strike, and asking for the rest of us to join in.  I don't know about the rest of the world, but we definitely don't see that kind of solidarity in the United States often, and almost never to stop people with actual power.  Let's hope that it makes more headway *and* that we actually learn something from it this time instead of the usual "going back to normal" when the crisis ebbs.

Anyway, as [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Meanwhile, we have a slightly newer look to these posts, such as a nicer header image, and sources with Fediverse accounts have those noted.  Those people checking out the Markdown source behind the scenes will also see that a bit cleaner.  It looks like those changes broke a couple of posts going out, for which I apologize, but the Friday posts soldier on as normal, otherwise.

If you have wondered why Republicans seem so excited to move the economy to cryptocurrency platforms even while everybody else has moved on, lobbying (bribery) explains it pretty well.

Let's hope that this momentum for mobilizing not only grows stronger, but persists *past* getting these creeps out of office, so that we can finally make the necessary structural changes to keep them from doing this in another sixty years.

> “There are some things regarding this project that are, frankly, of top-secret nature that we are currently working on. That does not preclude us from changing the above-grade structure, but that work needed to be considered when doing this project, which was not part of the NCPC process,” he said.

Hashtags:  #Trump #WhiteHouse

You might notice that, since getting into office, the administration has prioritized finding somewhere to hide, as if---even with stacking every agency with white supremacists and other loyalists---they fully expect someone to physically drag them out.  People have floated the idea that they don't expect to leave, but this obsession has looked a lot more alleviating their fears...

Hm.  A technology that makes searching the web more difficult, all information suspect, knowledge workers less capable, and pushes culture towards a stagnant average, while burning energy.  Remind me again what we need this for...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://futurism.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tech-corporations-human-fracking.jpg|Some Silicon Valley campus, probably, but they didn't caption it...|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Tech Corporations Engaging in “Human Fracking”](https://futurism.com/future-society/tech-corporations-human-fracking) from Futurism

> “Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetizable black gold to the surface,” writes D Graham Burnett, a professor of history at Princeton University, in an essay for The Guardian, “human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.”

I expect to use the phrase "human fracking" a lot more in the future...

{% cw US Politics (Resistance) %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Nonviolent discipline is helping turn the tide on ICE](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2026/01/nonviolent-discipline-is-helping-turn-the-tide-on-ice/) from Waging Nonviolence

> When nonviolent movements face severe repression, the resulting suffering of victims may arouse a sympathetic response among third parties, winning support for the movement and increasing opposition to the brutality of the opponent. In this framing the government’s deployment of militarized force can be seen as a sign of weakness, of vulnerability to organized opposition.

I don't think that the article quite makes its case, but we do need to bear in mind that the escalations have happened because the creeps in power feel insecure.  They have no idea how to handle the actual power of the country's population.  It'll get worse as they continue to fail, but they all see their house of cards collapsing.

{% cw Policing %}
{% embed https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/police-related-stress-health-black-women-1600.jpg|Las Vegas Police car|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Police-related stress tied to health risk for Black women](https://www.futurity.org/police-related-stress-health-black-women-3319852/) from Futurity

> “What’s more, the increased IMT thickness of both the High Child Vigilance and Moderate Child Vigilance groups was comparable. This raises additional questions about whether there is a threshold level of stress that may be related to this cardiovascular risk marker.

Oh, you say that terrorizing people for their entire lives has detrimental health effects?  I never would've guessed...

More seriously, I wanted to send this link out during the week, but it got overshadowed by everything else.
