As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...these issues have become even more pressing as the so-called â€˜alt-rightâ€™ movement â€“ which has been widely associated with racism, antisemitism and misogyny â€“ amassed growing power and attention in the wake of Trumpâ€™s presidential bid and his time in Washingtonâ€™s corridors of power.

Hashtags:  #FarRight #Misogyny

I've said for something like a decade that this entire space thrives on pitching itself on statistics out of context, like how most workplace deaths happen to men (ignoring that it happens because we push women out of dangerous jobs) or the like.  They don't have any solutions, as you might guess from their ignoring the causes of their problems, so anybody who takes the bait gets immersed in misogyny, and that opens the door to other kinds of bigotry.

As a result, they *hate* feminism, which has a tendency to point out why patriarchal structures also give men a bad deal, much like white supremacists hate Critical Race Theory for pointing out that colonialism and slavery caused a lot of our current problems that we could fix.

 > Government doesnâ€™t do, people do. Itâ€™s people who make laws, itâ€™s people who change laws. Itâ€™s people who make things happen. So my question is, what are you going to do to make the government more representative? It wonâ€™t change unless we change it.

Don't [call them weird]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %}), though, you know?  Please think of them as *extremely normal* as they borrow old racism to endanger an American city, a thing that normal people definitely do...

 > Following the receipt of the gladsome news great joy and enthusiasm seemed to fill every heart; and during the night following, the occasion was celebrated by immense processions of men and boys marching through the principal streets to the music of many brass bands, the firing of cannon, and the discharge of anvils.

Shocking, right?  If you give people food, you decrease hunger, making them healthier.  And one political philosophy doesn't like that, because (they insist that) only a communist would care about children...

 > This matters because the healthiest place to store fat is the fat tissue just under the skin where the samples were taken, called subcutaneous adipose tissue. Increasing the capacity to store fat here through exercise reduces the need to store fat in unhealthy places, like in the fat tissue around the organs or in the organs themselves.

I don't have any comment, here, but it seemed interesting.

Notice how desperately these sorts of people want to feel powerful.  They'll go out of their way to hurt people who they think of as weak, since stronger people terrify them.  They might use weapons, embracing all the clichÃ©s of (take this however you please) impotence.  And if they can't hurt their targets directly, then they'll set up a simulation of that person to hurt.  It seems like a lot of work to avoid actually growing a spine and learning to deal with people, if you ask me...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [NextNavâ€™s Callous Land-Grab to Privatize 900 MHz](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/nextnavs-callous-band-grab-privatize-900-mhz) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation

 > What NextNav did include however is its intent to resell their exclusive bandwidth access to mobile 5G networks. This isn't about national security or innovation; it's about a rent-seeker monopolizing access to a public resource. If NextNav truly believes in their GPS backup vision, they should look to parts of the spectrum already allocated for 5G.

Think about the sort of corruption that the company must have expected to face, that they could both claim to want this space for public safety *and* also turn around and explain how they'll cynically profit from it.

 > Visually, BandWagon strongly resembles Bandcamp and the Myspace Music pages of yore. It offers a landing page with a few different tabs, and some simple customization options for color and layout. From here, musicians can list their tracks, albums, and news updates, all while linking to other places on the Web.

I know that a lot of people have wanted alternatives to Bandcamp for a while, so I wanted to make sure that this got some attention.
