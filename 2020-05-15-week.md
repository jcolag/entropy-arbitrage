As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Turns out, the gentleman from North Carolina (Burr) was busy on Thursday, both stepping down from the Senate intelligence committee ([Richard Burr to step down as Intelligence Committee chairman](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/richard-burr-steps-down-intel-chairman/index.html) from CNN) and getting served an FBI warrant ([FBI serves warrant on senator in investigation of stock sales linked to coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-13/fbi-serves-warrant-on-senator-stock-investigation) from the Los Angeles Times).

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The African slave who taught America how to vaccinate itself from smallpox](https://qz.com/africa/1854780/an-african-slave-taught-america-to-vaccinate-from-smallpox/) from Quartz Africa

 > Enquiring of my Negro man, Onesimus, who is a pretty intelligent fellow, whether he had ever had the smallpox, he answered, both yes and no; and then told me that he had undergone an operation, which had given him something of the smallpox and would forever preserve him from it; adding that it was often used among the Guramantese and whoever had the courage to use it was forever free of the fear of contagion.

I figured this was especially interesting as it dawns on everybody that [It Was Clear COVID-19 Would Hit Black People Hard. Yet Experts Stayed Silent](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wjq7/it-was-clear-covid-19-would-hit-black-people-hard-yet-experts-stayed-silent) (via VICE).
