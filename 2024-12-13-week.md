As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...CFPB published a long anticipated proposed rule change around how data brokers handle peoples‚Äô sensitive information, including their name and address, which would introduce increased limits on when brokers can distribute such data.

I hope that they can push this through.  As long-time readers already know, a couple of years ago, I started having [my information removed from public records sites]({% post_url 2021-08-01-records %}), the process (more or less) quarterly in the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).  While the sites probably don't actually put me at risk, personally, I find them objectionable for how much danger they happily put *other* people in.

Keep telling me about "liberal media bias," though, as every corporate outlet pulls garbage like this.

Yes.  Absolutely, yes.  Democracy has *far* more to it than voting.  Ideally, your representatives should instinctively groan when they see or hear your name, because it comes up so often, and we need to lay the groundwork for others to do the same...

This definitely has potential.  If you have any interest in housing reform, definitely give this a ready.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Taking advantage of the controversy, an association for the defense of the ‚Äúwell-being of children and adolescents‚Äù has filed a criminal complaint against the General Director of Culture and Education of the Province of Buenos Aires, Alberto Sileoni, for the ‚Äúcorruption of minors, dissemination of pornographic material to minors and abuse of authority.‚Äù

I'd expect to see more of this around the world, sadly.  And I feel like I don't need to say that those groups definitely don't care about anybody's well-being...
