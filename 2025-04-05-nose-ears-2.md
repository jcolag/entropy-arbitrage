This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **Nose Ears**, from *Malicious Software* (#51) to *Peak Equality* (#99).

![Comic #83, The Least Oppressed. Eunice worries that they lost the Oppression Olympics. Mimi offers the consolation prize of a mountain of cash](/blog/assets/NE_en_83.png "A bit disappointing that we don't see the mountain of cash built by shaking down all the winners")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Nose Ears**
 * Location:  <https://wuzzy.neocities.org/>
 * Released:  2021 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Wuzzy](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/)
 * Medium:  Comic strip
 * Length:  Approximately one thousand strips (currently)
 * Content Advisories:  

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Nose Ears

OK, so we need to start by pointing out that this comic derives its characters and art from Nina Paley's **Mimi and Eunice**, about who and which more later.  That out of the way, the website describes the comic as follows.

 > Nose Ears is an absurd comic about the absurd things in life. There’s not any particular topic because absurdity can be found everywhere: In the Internet, in computers, games, gender, bigotry, power structures, copyright, language, crappy ideologies, belief systems, emotions and much more.
 >
 > There’s also an official German version. A few comic strips are untranslatable, so they only exist in one language.

It also has a [long history](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/meta/long_history/) page that details the thinking that went into deciding to adapt/continue/rebut the original comic.

And that brings us to Paley.  We've "met" her before when talking about [**Sita Sings the Blues**]({% post_url 2021-11-06-sita %}), and in that post, I explained the unpleasantness surrounding any support for her.  I respect that she probably did more than anybody else---through publicizing her film---to bring people to Free Culture, *but* she got there herself to spite the estate of Annette Hanshaw for daring to enforce copyright.  Because this incident led her to oppose copyright in general, she supports paying to support companies who manufacture physical media or stream it digitally, but not artists.  Her two major films both aggressively dismiss non-Western culture.  And in trying to defend her transphobia, expressed anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, misogynist, and anti-science views, while blaming some variation of the woke mob for the backlash against her transphobic comics.

I go through all this, not because I want to "take her down" or give her *any* attention at all, but partly to warn you that supporting her work will inevitably tie you to all her issues, and maybe more importantly for this post, indicate what about **Nose Ears** caught my attention.  You see, I learned about the project when the creator posted on Mastodon---I can't find the toot---that they think of it as a Free Culture experiment, taking the good parts of work by a problematic individual like Paley, and building on it to create something that puts the concept to better use without whitewashing their problems.

In that sense, the comic exemplifies a lot of what I've always wanted to see in Free Culture.  When I [introduced this series of posts]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}), I talked about especially wanting to find properties that could grow beyond the creator's personal attention.  And every week, I talk about elements of each work that you or I can "borrow" for exactly those purposes.  This comic does both, and stands against a lousy political stance.

## What Works Well?

While I would never call this a continuous narrative, I should note that these comics do continue some conversations that we saw in [last week's post]({% post_url 2025-03-29-nose-ears-1 %}), as if we've checked back in on the argument.

More importantly to some, we also see an expansion in the topics discussed, so that it doesn't feel like a software blog that happens to have fictional characters.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

A handful of the comics feel bluntly didactic, mostly stating the existence of an argument, such as the [Open Source term](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/comic/88/).  Others seem strangely archaic with no actual argument, such as what I can only describe as [anti-communist propaganda](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/comic/80/) of the sort that I haven't seen since the 1980s.

The author also works on [Repixture](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/repixture) (main developer) and [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org) (co-developer), which might also warrant some support.

## What's Adaptable?

I don't see anything particularly new, though Corporation, Incorporated's business model gets more depth, and we have an implied awful culture of their world.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll wrap up (for now) **Nose Ears**, reading *Doing your Best* (#102) to *Non-Fungible Tokens* (#150).

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
