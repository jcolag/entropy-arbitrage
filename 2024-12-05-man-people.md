## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Man of The People

We should probably get it out of the way now, that the writers transparently modeled the plot after Oscar Wilde's [**The Picture of Dorian Gray**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray), down to naming the transport ship the *Dorian*.  Here, the character who usually doesn't serve much purpose beyond decoration substitutes for the painting, which I feel would work well as ironic meta-commentary, if I thought that the writers had that much self-awareness...

 > Captain's log, stardate 46071.6. We have been called to the aid of a transport ship, which has been attacked near Rekag-Seronia. Hostilities between the two factions on that planet have intensified recently, threatening an important Federation shipping route.

Note the important aspect, here:  They have threatened *commerce*.

 > **SIMONS**: Ambassador Alkar, the Rekag-Seronia dispute has threatened Federation ships for many months. We are grateful that you are willing to undertake this mission, and you have our full support.

You might recognize Simons as none other than [George Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_D._Wallace)...the actor, I mean, not any of the many others.  He played Commando Cody in [**Radar Men from the Moon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Men_from_the_Moon)---maybe most relevant to his appearance, here---and had a lengthy career from there that branched into Broadway.

 > **RIKER**: Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew evaluation reports.

Ah, yes, the true mark of a professional, whining about needing to do administrative work instead of the exciting activities.  And I should maybe point out that we tend to associate administrative work as feminine and low-value, which should feel more relevant in an episode that focuses on treating women as disposable tools.

 > **CRUSHER**: Forty ccs inaprovaline.

This drug seems to take all its name components from various generic drugs, *but* none of the meaningful parts, again suggesting brand names.  Likewise, "dylamadon," which gets a mention later.  Later still, cordrazine makes another appearance, last mentioned in [*Yesterday's Enterprise*]({% post_url 2023-08-10-yesterday-s-enterprise %}), I believe.

 > **TROI**: Computer today's appointment calendar.

You have to appreciate that the episode makes the important part of this Troi's aging and newfound interest in sexuality.  In other words, like every episode with the character's mother, they make it clear that the Federation sees no threat greater than a middle-aged woman who likes having sex.

 > **RIKER**: Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, why don't you give me a call.

Annoyingly, this feels like a huge advance for Riker.  You might remember his petty jealousy boiling over into violence back in [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}).

 > **JANEWAY**: I know it must be my imagination, but it seems as though Lieutenant Pinder just doesn't want me in his section.

You might recognize Janeway *not* as Kate Mulgrew, but as [Lucy Boryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Boryer), then known primarily as Janine on **Doogie Howser, M.D.**

 > **TROI**: Well, maybe he's just tired of hearing you complain.

Compare this "evil" Troi to the Troi without her empathic abilities in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}), where she mostly treated her patients the same callous way...

 > **RIKER**: What is this?

This feels like the wrong time to bring up Troi's flashback in [*Violations*]({% post_url 2024-08-01-violations %}), but if that holds up as a memory, then it seems impressively squeamish for him to run away when sexual aggression hurts *him*...

 > **PICARD**: It's nothing, it's superficial. What happened to Deanna?

Picard can't miss an opportunity to talk about his strength, I guess.

 > **OGAWA**: Yes, Doctor.

We all remember Ogawa, I imagine, last seen in [*The Inner Light*]({% post_url 2024-10-31-inner-light %}).

 > **PICARD**: Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break through it. I want that man on this ship.

As usual, Picard doesn't bother with petty things like local sovereignty or ending wars, when he takes personal offense.

 > **ALKAR**: Your own Federation Council has granted me safe and timely passage back to my planet. I expect you to honor that, Captain.

It occurs to me that Picard doesn't have a snappy rejoinder, here, such as "oh, they have disavowed you based on the evidence," suggesting that either he didn't think to warn anybody *or* he contacted the government and they shrugged.

 > **WORF**: Worf to Captain Picard. Ambassador Alkar is dead.

Do you think the logs will specify that they deliberately murdered him?  Because they seem to have done almost exactly that.

## Conclusions

Well, we don't get much out of this.

### The Bad

We can't pin this to a specific line, but the overall episode feels predicated on the idea that aging women shouldn't have any sexuality, and doing so somehow threatens people.  And we again see Riker flee the scene when a woman pursues him.

Commerce still takes priority in the Federation, with the potential impact on a distant shipping route outweighing other considerations in a potential war.  And when dealing with personal egos, sovereignty or those wars matter far less.

We see a lack of importance given to administrative work.

They make it seem unremarkable to act jealously possessive over a former romantic partner.

Picard, at least continues to obsess about his physical strength.

### The Weird

It still looks like they use brand-name drugs.

## Stay Tuned...

Next week, we wonder if a person can contribute to society if they don't keep up with the latest technology, in *Relics*.
