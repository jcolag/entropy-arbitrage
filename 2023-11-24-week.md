As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The researchers found no significant changes in violent crimes, property crimes recorded by police, 911 calls for crime, medical incidents, or 311 calls regarding drug use or ‚Äúunsanitary‚Äù conditions observed in the vicinity of the OPCs, and observed significant reductions in calls for homeless-related conditions.

It turns out that safety and security don't cause street crime.

As I commonly suggest, I believe that more or less everybody already knows this, *but* I still appreciate having a quantitative study that I can point at.

In case you had any illusions of these sorts of companies working for the public good, or even trying to avoid actively abetting illegal actions...

I hope that this story---the issue behind it, not necessarily this particular article---gets more attention.

Hashtags:  #Humanities #College

This feels like a difficult problem to crack, because so many students in technical fields would rather avoid humanities courses, anyway.  And yet, I probably got more out of a random literature or history class than half my programming classes, because the latter often covered the same ground for weeks at a time.

Much as the study about drug treatment facilities, I believe that we've known this for quite some time from other evidence, but I still appreciate having more information to validate the conclusion that early humans didn't actually have strict gender roles.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site's pages will build themselves

While not a perfect solution, because it looks like it has no route to discoverability, this looks like a fairly solid system for handling sales.  And for all the "alternative to Bandcamp" projects that I've seen over the last few weeks, surprisingly few of them have an interest in helping musicians *sell*...

## Follow Me

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
