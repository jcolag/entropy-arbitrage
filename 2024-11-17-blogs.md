* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Maybe this only really centers on my circle, but it feels like people have started taking RSS seriously for the first time in at least a decade, at least partly because "I get my news from social media" once again makes you look like a tool, for a variety of reasons.  As such, this seemed like a good time to go through my own feed-reader and dump out the list of blogs that I read, on the chance that some reader finds something new.  I think that people used to call this a "blogroll," but since I don't intend to maintain this list, nor do I have much nostalgia for the 1990s when people took blogging seriously, I will **not** call it that[^1].

[^1]:  Based on a [post by Andre Garzia](https://andregarzia.com/2024/05/feed-and-blogrolls-discovery.html "A post on RSS feeds and blogrolls"), whose name will come up later, it looks like blogrolls have become slightly more formal than that, with an [RSS-like standard](https://opml.org/blogroll.opml "A blogroll standard")---linking to an XML file from a page's header---instead of the sidebar of links that people used to have.

![RSS icon in melon slices in a dish](/blog/assets/5066159552_b48d5080c9_o.png "Every time that I write about blogging in some respect, I feel like a failure in my relative inability to find anything resembling a useful header image...")

On the technical side, to generate the skeleton of this post, I had my feed-reader export an [Outline Processor Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) file, then wrote some boring code to pull out the names and URLs for each category as a Markdown list of links.  From there, I added the text.

Mind you, the actual selection probably won't surprise most readers, here, because I regularly share links from many of these sources.  For example, if you didn't click through to a project's website when I talk about it in a [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) post and subscribe to the RSS feed, I doubt my throwing it on a list will get you to act.  Still, you might find *something* that you didn't know about.

As a word of warning, I only spot-checked these links.  If a site hasn't thrown errors and I had a fairly clear idea of how to describe it, I didn't bother to see if it still exists.  As such, take care clicking through and, if your browser warns you not to go to a site for some serious-sounding reason, take its word for it over mine.

## Books and Reading

I don't read as much as I'd like, but I do enjoy them.

- [Quote Investigator](http://quoteinvestigator.com):  My reader has trouble parsing their RSS feed, so I don't *actually* read this nearly as much as I'd like, but maybe yours will fare better.
- [The Public Domain Review](http://publicdomainreview.org):  You know that I won't pass up someone highlighting material that has fallen into the public domain...

Also, check if your local library gives you access to [Next Reads](https://www.ebsco.com/novelist/products/libraryaware/nextreads-newsletters) or something like it.  It comes as both a newsletter for the genres that you choose *and* an RSS feed with everything.  I actually have this category *specifically* for Next Reads.

## Food

This category used to have a bunch of blogs.  Most of them have vanished, and I don't really have the interest in finding alternatives, since you could describe my current cooking style as "see what I have available and wing it."

- [Budget Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com):  I started reading this back at the start, when a student nutritionist posted some wild-looking recipes.  The blog has become *an enterprise*, since then, with Beth (the founder) mostly retiring, but they still sometimes come up with interesting ideas.

I still semi-regularly make the Chipotle Sweet Potato Burgers and Oatmeal Pumpkin Cookies, if you want some inspiration reading through.

## Free Culture

It shouldn't surprise long-time readers that the bulk of my RSS feed comes from people who work on Free Culture projects.  Rather than try to describe why I follow each blog, I'll instead mostly only point you to the post where I covered one of the creator's projects, if I did.  However, it also includes blogs that their authors have made available under Free Culture licenses.

- [All content on Seirdy’s Home](https://seirdy.one):  Rohan Kumar writes occasionally about accessibility and Indie Web issues.
- [alxd - solarpunk hacker](https://alxd.org/):  See also, [**Glider Ink**]({% post_url 2023-07-08-glider-ink %}).
- [Astronomy Picture of the Day RSS Feed](http://www.acme.com/jef/apod/):  I couldn't think of anyplace else to leave this, but you (probably) already know that APOD exists and can figure out the concept based on the name.  Jef's RSS feed improves slightly on NASA's version.
- [Barbara Fister](https://barbarafister.net):  See also, [**if then else**]({% post_url 2021-11-13-else %}).
- [clongclongmoo.org](https://www.clongclongmoo.org):  While no longer exclusively Creative Commons, unfortunately, the person or people behind the site trawl through other music sites looking for interesting pieces to highlight, and always specify the license.  I filter out the non-Free licenses, though it feels like "all rights reserved" material still falls through, no matter how aggressively I filter.
- [David Bollier - news and perspectives on the commons](http://www.bollier.org/):  David mostly talks environmentalism.
- [Deborah Makarios](https://deborah.makarios.nz):  See also, [**Restoration Day**]({% post_url 2024-10-12-restoration-day-1 %}).
- [Doing Slapstick in the Kingdom of the Blind](https://blindslapstick.wordpress.com):  See also, [*For the Fragile Muses*]({% post_url 2022-01-22-muses %}).
- [El blog sin nombre de Jectoons](https://blog.jectoons.net/):  See also, [**Random Vignettes**]({% post_url 2023-05-13-vignettes %}).
- [Entropy Arbitrage](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/):  Yes, I read my own blog, mostly to make sure that posts actually show up in the RSS feed...
- [Entropy Arbitrage - Social-ish Feed](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/):  This blog, too, though this reminds me that I should probably re-engineer the system so that I actually post there more often.
- [Free Gamer - Open Source Games (Free/Libre)](https://freegamer.blogspot.com/):  While not really updated anymore, they once posted when Free Software games got an update or release.
- [Full Circle --- An Independent Magazine For The Ubuntu Linux Community.](https://fullcirclemagazine.org/):  I suppose that the title provides most of the information that you'd want about the site.
- [Green Comet](https://greencomet.org):  See also, [**Green Comet**]({% post_url 2023-06-03-green-comet-1 %}).
- [Home on Libre Arts](https://librearts.org/):  Formerly **Libre Graphics World**, the magazine covers Free Software for the arts.
- [It's Pronounced Metrosexual](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/):  A terrible name, but the author (occasionally, now) writes about gender, sexuality, and social justice, abandoning the copyright to the contents in 2013.
- [Knowable Magazine](https://www.knowablemagazine.org/):  The online magazine covers a lot of issues, though not *quite* Free Culture, under a no-derivatives license.
- [Lunatics](https://lunaticsproject.org/):  See also, [**Lunatics**]({% post_url 2022-04-30-lunatics %}).
- [Mix Remix - Home](https://mixremix.cc/):  "Hairy Larry" writes overlapping between music and Free Culture.
- [Morevna Project](http://morevnaproject.org):  See also, [**Morevna**, Episode 3]({% post_url 2020-08-08-morevna3 %}).
- [Música Libre Uruguay](https://musicalibre.uy):  Another site that (less frequently) posts about Creative Commons licensed music, at least some of which comes under Free licenses.
- [Share America](https://share.america.gov):  The United States Bureau of Global Public Affairs runs a surprisingly good blog.  **Update**, 2025 May 07:  The Bureau has begun publishing nonsensical articles, probably written by generative AI rather than a person, that all go *extremely* far out of their way to praise Donald Trump, so I've unsubscribed at least until the regime changes.
- [Wellcome Collection stories](https://wellcomecollection.org/stories):  The Wellcome collection serves as a museum online and off, often publishing stories about disability and identity.
- [WMB Saltworks](https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com):  See also, [R. James Gavreau]({% post_url 2022-12-17-rjg %}).
- [Writing In Case](https://blog.ncase.me/):  See also, [**Nothing to Hide**]({% post_url 2020-11-07-hide %}).
- [~ajroach42.com](http://ajroach42.com/):  See also, [**Expedition: Sasquatch**]({% post_url 2023-04-22-sasquatch-1 %}).

You might want to also check out [Web Comics](#web-comics), below, for a few more items that *could* have fit this category.

## Link Sources

Many years ago, I had this category packed tightly.  Over the years, though, these sorts of sites have fallen into three overlapping groups.  First, you have the sites that have vanished or changed direction.  Then, you have the sites that so reliably point to the same other sources that I could cut out the intermediary.  Finally, you have the sites where the author wanted to professionalize posting links to other people's sites as "content curators," as if calling writers and artists content creators didn't already feel dismissive and exploitative...

- [kottke.org](http://kottke.org/):  I get the feeling that I wouldn't like Mr. Kottke if I needed to interact with him directly, and find most of his writing pretentious[^2], *but* his blog has introduced me to bunches of other websites.
- [Smithsonian Insider](https://insider.si.edu):  I didn't actually know where this should land, and they don't seem to publish much anymore, but the Smithsonian Institute publishes some interesting stories.

[^2]:  Because people have asked, he feels like bad social media.  A lot of his posts want to talk about (or find) the popular thing, whether art, politics, or some nostalgic memory.  And when he feels bad about politics, he seems to want *everybody* to feel bad, too, posting links to every nihilistic article that he can find.  I describe it as "bad social media," because it all feels like it wants to game the algorithm, even though his blog doesn't *have* an algorithm or any reason to care about one.  He also frequently posts that he wants to "take a day off," like a nine-to-five job...

Anyway, I don't know how long this category will actually survive, after so many years of having it.

## Media

This category mostly includes sites that analyze the media.

- [FAIR](https://fair.org):  Not the racist FAIR, but Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, routinely takes on corporate media bias.  As one of the few sources that interview labor leaders and the like, I often think of them more as news than media criticism.
- [FTV Live](https://www.ftvlive.com/):  While not critical for me, the author of the blog as broken news about the news industry for a *long* time.  It can get a bit socially regressive[^3] at times, but if you want to hear about the television news business, you'll probably hear about updates here, first.
- [metafilm --- OVID.tv](https://metafilm.ovid.tv):  Indie streaming service Ovid has a blog spotlighting their offerings.  I feel like I ask this often, but why doesn't *every* streaming service have some text or video product drawing attention to the good material...?
- [Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net):  While I often find Doctorow tedious, he has his heart in the right place, and the majority of his political takes say things more carefully than I might.
- [Recent irows_cliodynamics items](https://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics):  UC Riverside publishes Open Access articles "integrating historical macrosociology, cultural and social evolution, economic history/cliometrics, mathematical modeling of long-term social processes, and the construction and analysis of historical databases."
- [Whose Knowledge?](https://whoseknowledge.org/):  While I don't believe that they say the word in their self-descriptions, you can think of this as a project to "decolonize" the Internet.

[^3]:  Again, because people have asked, he occasionally highlights petty errors or---especially, in my reasoning, here---female journalists posting to social media about their personal lives, and decrying those incidents (and not the market consolidation, private equity management, constant both-sides narratives that leave out workers, or much of anything else) as the reason that people don't trust the news anymore.  I don't believe that he *intends* to present things this way, but I roll my eyes at and scroll past too many of the posts.

It helps that about half of these publish under Free licenses.

## Miscellaneous

These sites didn't fit anywhere else.  Or didn't, back when I had more in here.

- [zen habits](https://zenhabits.net):  Babauta has published for a *long* time, and I drift in and out on the blog.  I don't love the framing as "zen," but he occasionally has some interesting ideas.

By the way, not only did I once have more sites, here, but I did so as recently as last week, when writing this showed a bunch of sites as taken over by shady organizations...

## News

Do I need to explain how news works?  I can say, though, that I lean heavily on independent journalism and especially journalism that releases under a Free license.  At some point, I should probably break this list down into different categories, since the list has gotten a bit long.

- [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/):  The revival of the remnants of VICE Motherboard carries on in a similar tradition.
- [Africa Is a Country](https://africasacountry.com/):  Humorous title aside, they cover the recovery of countries on the continent from colonialism and exploitation.
- [Agência Pública](https://apublica.org/):  This feed admittedly doesn't help me much, considering that I don't know nearly enough Portuguese to follow it without a translation.  But occasionally, I can get enough of the gist of a headline to want to click through to translate the full article...
- [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com):  The Global Investigative Journalism Network publishes the results of and methods behind so-called Open Source Intelligence, on stories of varying impact.
- [Citation Needed](https://www.citationneeded.news/):  The newsletter (with an RSS feed) successor or companion to Molly White's **Web 3 Is Going Great** looks at some interesting issues beyond the limited Web 3 scope.
- [Citizen Truth](https://citizentruth.org):  While their commitment to publishing "articles that represent the entire political spectrum" takes them to some incredibly silly places, they generally serve as a credible alternative journalism outlet.
- [Co.Exist](http://www.fastcoexist.com/):  Fast Company (an older name that they use) unfortunately describes itself as a "business media brand," but they cover a lot of interesting topics, often by syndicating from other sites worth knowing about.
- [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com):  They describe themselves as "news you can do something about," and while that doesn't *always* hold true---especially when all their writers have anxiety over whatever the authoritarians have on the agenda---they don't waste a lot of effort on trying to explain some alleged rationale behind authoritarians.
- [Deeplinks](https://www.eff.org):  While the Electronic Frontier Foundation has historically had an unfortunate anti-government or otherwise libertarian bias that conveniently ignores the overwhelming corporate influence on the Internet, they do sometimes push through that to advocating for more legitimate issues.
- [empty wheel](https://www.emptywheel.net):  I've followed Marcy Wheeler's writing since her days at ProPublica (for which, see below), and probably won't stop soon, because she consistently produces better insight than most other journalists.
- [English Wikinews](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page):  I can't *not* read the "free news source you can write"...
- [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/blog):  The FPF swings wildly in quality.  Sometimes, they'll talk deeply about policy or the mechanics of how modern journalism works.  Other times, they publish extraordinarily weak demands that some group stop interfering with journalists, as if a press pass should give someone elite treatment.
- [Futurism](https://futurism.com):  I actually started reading them because I confused them with **Futurity** down in the [technology](#technology) section, but they cover a lot of more entertaining stories and rarely pull any punches.
- [Global Voices](http://globalvoices.org):  While it doesn't always cover the entire world as well as we might wish, the writers vary between deep investigations of some issue to a round-up of comments on social media about a particular cultural event.  If you find your news too focused on the United States, Europe, and sometimes *maybe* Canada, start here to fix that.
- [In The Fray](https://inthefray.org/):  This magazine-like outlet covers global issues from the standpoint of essays recounting personal experiences.
- [Latino Rebels](http://www.latinorebels.com):  They may have gone on hiatus or ended their work, but this Futuro Media operation---to nobody's surprise---covers the news from a Latine, usually progressive perspective.
- [Mekong Eye](https://www.mekongeye.com/):  Not enough news comes out of Southeast Asia, so they try to fix that.
- [Minority Africa](https://minorityafrica.org/):  They have a weirdly clunky website where the text might unexpectedly not show up, but their focus on representing minority groups across Africa in order to boost civic engagement and democratic institutions makes me happy that they have a working RSS feed...
- [MuckRock News](https://www.muckrock.com/news/):  This group mostly reports the results of analysis of open records.
- [openDemocracy RSS](https://www.opendemocracy.net/):  An independent British outlet, they strive for quality journalism that makes an impact.
- [OtherWords](https://otherwords.org):  This group posts editorials from predominantly people from under-represented backgrounds, including women...though Jim Hightower also shows up a lot, despite identifying as neither.  I make a small monthly donation to them, full disclaimer.
- [Oxpeckers --- Unraveling the threads of snaring in Kruger park](https://oxpeckers.org):  They call themselves "Africa’s first investigative environmental journalism unit" named for the bird known for perching on large mammals to graze for parasites, focusing on data-driven journalism that publishes the data.
- [Prisoners of the Census](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news):  The Prison Policy Initiative's Prison Gerrymandering Project---what a mouthful...---seeks to better represent the prison population better than giving extra Congressional votes to whichever towns build a big enough prison that they won't maintain or get involved with.
- [ProPublica: Articles and Investigations](http://www.propublica.org/):  You've probably known about ProPublica for a while, so I won't try to explain the non-profit newsroom that not only frequently breaks critical stories, but also gave a start to a lot of the independent journalists who you might respect.
- [Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty](https://www.rferl.org):  The United States has funded this outlet since 1949, an artifact that maintains its value as an artifact of the Cold War that seeks to prove the value of a Free Press.  In other words, it can only achieve a propaganda victory by staying as honest as it reasonably can.
- [Rewire News Group](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/):  Imani Gandy and her team cover primarily reproductive health news.
- [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/):  As a "semi-official" Iranian news agency, it provides insight into a part of the world that I normally only see from the perspective of people who find them antagonists to every story.
- [The Conversation – Articles (US)](https://theconversation.com):  I believe that I discovered **The Conversation** through **Fast Company** (above), but regardless, they have experts write articles on current topics.  Like **Other Words**, I give them a small monthly donation.
- [TheBetter.news](https://thebetter.news/):  A European, progressive news agency, The Better tries to push back on the corporate-dominated space.
- [Truthmeter](https://truthmeter.mk):  They try to fact-check European political claims---largely around the invasion of Ukraine, these days, as you might guess---and push back on disinformation.
- [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com):  Like RFE/RL, the United States operates VoA as proof that a Free Press works.  As such, even when run by a Trump appointee, they don't (usually) go in for sensationalist headlines or attempts to make everybody seem credible.  However, they definitely try to avoid attacking anybody's position, which makes them far weaker than you might expect.  **Update**, 2025 May 07:  Something like this seemed inevitable with Trump in office, but [Voice of America will *at least* syndicate from One America News](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/nx-s1-5389453/kari-lake-says-oans-far-right-coverage-will-fuel-voice-of-america), assuming that they don't become an outlet for the far-right network, so I have unsubscribed until we oust the regime.
- [Waging Nonviolence](https://wagingnonviolence.org/):  They mostly report on progressive social movements, looking to share the lessons learned by each group.

I also follow [National Weather Service Alerts](https://alerts.weather.gov/), [air quality](https://www.airnow.gov), and air quality alerts (same site) for my area.  I removed them from the list, because you care about the conditions in *your* neighborhood, not mine, and knowing that I had a 34 AQI (for Ozone) and a coastal flood warning when I wrote this probably won't improve your life much.

## People

These *specific* people (mostly?) come from Cohost, but I follow them now because I followed them then, and because I like their writing, so maybe you will, too.  As such, I won't try to describe any of their blogs.  To avoid accidentally revealing somebody's identity, I've removed the parenthetical notes in the titles that remind me who writes which blog.  Unfortunately, that means that some blog titles won't carry much if any information, especially combined with my lack of comments.  Oh, I also capitalized proper nouns to minimize the complaining from my spell-check.

I also follow a couple of people's Bluesky feeds, here, if they don't have a presence anywhere else.  Like a lot of the modern crop of social media sites, Bluesky has the decency to generate RSS feeds for following accounts without bothering with their site, even though we can't respond to anything.  You can find a Bluesky RSS feed by appending `/rss` to the profile URL for the user.

## Software and Programming

This category includes specific software projects, blogs by specific developers, and so forth.

- [AirAKose](https://airakose.com/blog/):  A game programmer whose writing I enjoy.  Maybe I discovered them on Cohost and followed their blog instead of their account?  I don't know...
- [as days pass by](https://www.kryogenix.org/days/):  You might know British developer Stuart Langridge from his long association with Ubuntu or the [**Bad Voltage**](https://www.badvoltage.org/) podcast.  He also writes, usually interesting topics.
- [Canonical](http://insights.ubuntu.com):  Admittedly, most of the Ubuntu-maker's posts don't have much to them beyond press releases for some initiative, but *sometimes* they have something interesting.
- [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat):  As an e-mail defender, I love the idea of "re-branding" e-mail as a chat application.  They make a good point, after all, that we only get two kinds of e-mails, the kind that we respond to immediately and the kind that we largely ignore, exactly like a chat.
- [Disroot Blog](https://disroot.org/en/blog/):  I use Disroot's services, so I like to keep up to date, when they have something to say.
- [Drew DeVault's blog](https://drewdevault.com):  DeVault writes mostly about the culture in Free Software circles, sometimes prodding me to expand on ideas that he wrote about from my own perspective.
- [GitHub Status - Incident History](https://www.githubstatus.com):  GitHub once had a fairly good real-time tracker of incidents.  This doesn't do that, sadly.
- [Haiku Project](https://www.haiku-os.org):  I don't use the Haiku operating system, but I like the idea of continuing where BeOS left off, and would love to see it become a viable alternative instead of a nostalgia project.
- [Libravatar Blog](http://blog.libravatar.org/):  While the blog comments, sadly, use Gravatar instead of Libravatar, I do like to keep up to date with whatever the latter has running, though they haven't posted in a few years.
- [LWN.net](http://lwn.net):  They at least try to cover news in the Linux and Free Software communities.
- [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research):  While this has increasingly gotten clogged up with AI marketing, they *previously* published a variety of interesting research...
- [Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org):  Like the previous item, this has gone from a wide variety of topics to trying to justify further attention on language models, to my irritation.
- [nix's blog](https://nullarch.com/blog/index.html):  Creator of the "30 Day FOSS Challenge" to show people that you can, in fact, handle at least most of your work with Free Software.
- [OMG! Ubuntu!](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk):  Not quite what it sounds like, the author actually covers a variety of Open Source software and hardware releases, plus some occasional institutional news.
- [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/frontpage):  This Red Hat initiative takes---took?  I haven't seen much from them in a while---news from a variety of writers on almost any topic that touches on Free Software in some way.
- [Ruby News](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/):  I like the Ruby language, so I follow the blog to know what they have in store.
- [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/):  Bruce Schneier mostly writes about human-friendly security policy, though will occasionally talk about interesting system hacks.
- [The diaspora* blog](https://blog.diasporafoundation.org):  As much as Diaspora remains a bit-player even in the Free Software social media space, I do want it to succeed.
- [The Old New Thing](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/):  Raymond Chen has run his blog for many years, and generally alternates between gnarly support issues, new-to-him programming finds, and funny personal anecdotes.
- [The Plover Blog](http://plover.stenoknight.com/):  It doesn't post often, but the creator of the Free Software stenography software of choice *does* occasionally post about goings-on in the stenography community.
- [The Rust Programming Language Blog](http://blog.rust-lang.org/):  Similar to Ruby, above, I want to keep up to date with Rust.
- [The Stallman report](https://stallman-report.org/):  I don't know if this RSS feed will ever contain anything, but given the meticulous nature of the reporting, here, I want to see where it goes.
- [This Week in Rust](http://this-week-in-rust.org/):  You can think of this as the companion to the official language blog, a round-up of what the community has done.  Admittedly, I find a lot of posts too dense to read through, but I wish that more communities would do this sort of thing.
- [Wikimedia blog](https://blog.wikimedia.org):  Diff highlights events and projects across the various Wikimedia initiatives, usually global.
- [Xandra Granade](https://www.xgranade.com):  While they don't seem to post much anymore, and many posts revolve around gaming that I definitely don't care about, but they also think much bigger than that, with topics like federation and quantum computing in recent history.

I also follow my own feed on GitHub and Codeberg, which---if you have accounts on either---you might want to substitute with your own feed.  GitHub uses theirs to notify you when the people who you follow do something important.

## Technology

This category actually covers most science and technology topics.

- [AndreGarzia.com](https://andregarzia.com/recent.html):  Andre mostly writes about programming, but also storytelling and other topics.
- [Awesci – Science Every day](http://awesci.com):  It looks like they haven't posted in quite a while, but they used to post on a variety of science-and-technology topics.
- [Creative Commons – Singularity Hub](https://singularityhub.com):  For the most part, they try to find active, successful breakthroughs to report on them.  I subscribe specifically to their less-frequented Creative Commons sub-site.
- [DSHR's Blog](https://blog.dshr.org/):  David Rosenthal has worked on a lot of technical projects over the years, and now works in digital preservation.  This blog covers a lot of that, plus (partly skeptically) cryptocurrency.
- [Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories](http://www.evilmadscientist.com):  I don't know how their acquisition has and will change things, but they previously developed a variety of Open Source Hardware kits.  They also used to post a monthly "linkdump" post, where I'd invariably find something interesting, partly inspiring my sharing links on social media and using the same term for the round-ups.
- [Futurity](http://www.futurity.org):  While they focus on highlighting research at their member universities, you'll also find one-off articles about current events.
- [Global](http://www.scidev.net/global/):  They cover technology advancements in the so-called developing world.
- [JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/):  You already probably know that JSTOR itself exists.  This arm publishes articles rounding up recent papers that connect with current events.
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):  Yes, they have a---pretty boring, but occasionally useful---blog.
- [LOW←TECH MAGAZINE English](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/posts/):  The solar-powered magazine about old solutions to modern problems still occasionally delivers some interesting ideas.
- [Modern CSS Solutions](https://moderncss.dev):  Stephanie Eckles helps highlight recent web-based styling technologies that we might otherwise overlook.  I made a few changes to the blog and other projects based on items that I saw here.
- [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai):  Avoiding the breathless excitement of the rest of the industry, MAIEI has focused for a *long* time on advocating for policy that requires responsible use of the broad spectrum of AI technologies.
- [News from the Opt-Out Project](https://buttondown.com/optoutproject):  Janet Vertesi writes about her quest to avoid constant online surveillance.  This actually covers the mailing list.  You'll find the main site's feed later.
- [The Hypothesis](https://buttondown.com/thehypothesis):  Annalee Newitz "delivers a mix of science news, historical analysis, and evidence-based speculation" in her newsletter.
- [The Opt-Out Project](https://www.optoutproject.net):  The other half of Vertesi's blog lives here.
- [the Website League newsletter](https://buttondown.com/websiteleague):  This project aspired to fill the void left by Cohost closing as a group of federated websites standing apart from the Fediverse.  However, it never seems to have posted any updates since the initial plans.
- [We Distribute](https://wedistribute.org):  Officially on hiatus for the moment, they cover news across the Fediverse development community, particularly new software releases.

Should programmer blogs have ended up here or in the [software](#software) section?  Who knows?  I classify them when I subscribe, not using some system...

Oh, like mentioning that you can follow people on Bluesky through RSS, I should highlight those newsletters.  It turns out that modern newsletter platforms will deliver to you through RSS instead of e-mail, meaning that you don't need to hand over your address to some faceless company.

## Web Comics

Finally, we have comics that I follow, some of which could have also gone into the [Free Culture](#free-culture) category, but don't because comics notionally belong closer together.  I'll treat those as I did the Free Culture blogs, as a reference to the project.

- [2D Goggles](http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles):  While it hasn't had an update in a long time, Sydney Padua's **Babbage and Lovelace** comic provided me with plenty of entertainment.
- [ANTUMBRA](https://antumbra.thecomicseries.com):  See also, [**Antumbra**]({% post_url 2024-08-17-antumbra %}).
- [Barnacle Press](http://www.barnaclepress.com):  This blog, at least for many years, collected many early comic strips.  I don't know if it'll come back, but the subscription doesn't take up any space...
- [Fodongo: A Free Culture Comics Zine](https://fodongo.jectoons.net):  See also, [*Only One*]({% post_url 2023-12-23-only-one %}) and other mentions.
- [Let's Move Forward!](https://lmf.animerrill.com):  See also, [**Let's Move Forward**]({% post_url 2023-06-24-move-forward %}).
- [Pepper & Carrot](http://www.peppercarrot.com/):  See also, [**Pepper & Carrot**]({% post_url 2020-12-19-pepper %}) and other mentions.
- [Random Vignettes](https://randomvignettes.jectoons.net):  See also, [**Random Vignettes**]({% post_url 2023-05-13-vignettes %}).
- [Savage Chickens - Cartoons on Sticky Notes by Doug Savage](http://www.savagechickens.com):  While occasionally hit-or-miss, like any long-running, multiple-times-per-week comic, I often find Doug's comments worth a quick laugh.
- [The Official K Chronicles and (Th)ink Website](https://kchronicles.com):  Keith "Keef" Knight's comic, which Hulu adapted for its series **Woke**, always supplies a well-needed laugh.

I used to read a lot more web comics, but they've either ended---officially or not---or become increasingly difficult to tolerate.

## Final Thoughts

Feel free to recommend other blogs, if you see a glaring gap in my lists, though I can't guarantee that I'll take the advice; for example, I already know that XKCD exists, but haven't found it entertaining in something like a decade.  I mostly post this for people to dig through to see if they can find something that'll interest them, though, so don't feel compelled to try to find something that I might have missed.

And I want to reiterate the value of OPML files.  You can use them to quickly move from one RSS feed reader to another.  But you can also use them to share what you read, so that others can import your feeds in bulk.  I recently saw someone on Mastodon---I forget who, and can't find the post---compare OPML files to Bluesky's "starter packs," a way to help people quickly populate their reading.

However, you can also process them, as I did for this post, as long as you don't mind working with XML.

Finally, this post took *far* too much time.  I don't recommend trying to describe almost a hundred fifty blogs and news sites in a hurry...
