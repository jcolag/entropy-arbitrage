As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Hashtags:  #PayPal

Personally, I only have a PayPal account at all, because so many early dotcoms used them as a payment processor and couldn't get the actual credit card code to work right.  And every time that I have needed to interact with them, they've made me regret that decision.

I assume that this would work elsewhere, hence my interest.

 > Nations disappear and lineage sinks into oblivion once the national language is forgotten; that is why the Aztecs do not exist anymore as a nation. Rome had so much influence in all the nations that it had conquered because of its language, and if the Jews are not a nation today it is because each one of them speaks the language of the land they inhabit.

 > The obstacles to assistance when we need it are many. You must be destitute to receive help, and as soon as you begin to get back on your feet, that critical assistance can be pulled away.

The entire system feels like such nonsense.  In no other case do we think that a working system waits for problems to happen and then does the bare minimum in hopes that the problem goes away.

If the Supreme Court didn't actually have so much power, by virtue of the deference given to it by everybody else, I'd find it hilarious how much the "moderate centrist institutionalist" acts exactly like a partisan hack.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}
{% embed https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1351996/story_image/GettyImages-2167290652.jpg|Conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., right, and Donald Trump|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [RFK Jr.‚Äôs alleged womanizing threatens Trump, and I can‚Äôt stop laughing](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/10/3/2274390/-RFK-Jr-s-endless-scandals-cause-chaos-for-Team-Trump) from Daily Kos

 > One of the sources who spoke with Mediaite said the scandal swirling around Kennedy over the relationship with Nuzzi is seen internally as an issue the campaign wants to stay as far away from as possible, particularly given Trump‚Äôs own history of womanizing.

I'll admit to some jealousy over this whole election cycle:  It bothers me that, never in my wildest imaginings, could I *ever* concoct a fictional character as blatantly problematic as this Kennedy kid.  And the idea that Republicans thought that dangling somebody with his famous surname would impress anybody says a lot about how they think.
