As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 07 September 2020

Despite my making fun of Labor Day [on Monday]({% post_url 2020-09-07-literacy %}), I decided to take the day off.  I have no shame.  Even a dumb holiday is still a holiday...

 > "Workers, especially Black workers, have been telling us all for months that Amazon is targeting them for speaking out. This job description is proof that Amazon intends to continue on this course."

As Amazon captures a larger fraction of the market, expect them to become more brazen in their abuse.  For example, their products [might be less safe](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-has-an-exploding-product-problem-1845020295).

 > She said that the lecturers have been helpful, telling the students that they can give them a call if they need help, but they did not show their support openly.

It's always worth remembering that more people *want* to stand on the right side of history than don't, but many of them are afraid to speak out.  The first part of that is heartening, but their invisibility makes them dangerous, making it seem like the actual support is much smaller.  Every movement needs a way of bridging that gap.

Something went wrong with the scheduling, so no quote.

 > When it comes to the older adults, volunteering and giving affection were related to higher attractiveness ratings. When it comes to young people, those who volunteered rated higher.

You know, in case you needed a reason to help people *other* than creating a better world and feeling better about yourself.

 > On St. Patrick's Day 1970, the branch voted to go on strike, effectively halting mail delivery in Manhattan...

Yes, strikes carry a risk  But they have always been powerful, because companies can't function without their workers.  That's especially true of an organization like the United States Postal Service that binds the country together.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Political ads don’t really persuade voters](https://www.futurity.org/political-ads-voters-persuasion-2433152/) from Futurity

 > They found that, on average and across all variables, the ads moved a candidate’s favorability rating respondents only .05 of a point on the survey’s five-point scale, which is small but statistically significant given the study’s large size, note the researchers. The ads’ effect on whom individuals intended to vote for was smaller still—a statistically insignificant 0.007 of a percentage point.

We've seen findings like this before.  What we haven't seen is an analysis of whether those small differences are useful or whether it's all wasted money.  The intuition is that the candidates are wasting money, obviously, and if that's true, that's a much easier way to get money out of politics than legislation.  It's also not clear whether this applies to candidates who aren't already well-known.
