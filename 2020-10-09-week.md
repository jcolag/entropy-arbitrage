As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1313102136650076162) [Democrats Need to Wake Up: The Trump Movement Is Shot Through With Fascism](https://theintercept.com/2020/09/27/trump-supporters-fascism-election/) from The Intercept

 > Not only do some Trump supporters understand that he is an autocrat who will cheat the rules to stay in power, that’s precisely what they like about him.

One of the reasons I posted my overview of the tension between [the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement]({% post_url 2020-09-06-enlight %}) is the connections Umberto Eco made about [fascism's rejection of "the left"](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/) and how that all comes together under an administration that rejects science and fact in favor of emotional outbursts.

 > The colors boiled like sparks of light, blending into intermediate inks, interrupting with joyous contrasts. It would seem that with that stream of colors, the fields were the immense palette where the supreme artist had to moisten his brushes.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1313465279691644929) [Trump tax returns: Top 5 jaw-droppers from the NYT exposé](https://www.fastcompany.com/90556946/trump-tax-returns-top-5-jaw-droppers-from-the-nyt-expose) from Fast Company

 > Since Trump began his run for president in 2015---and since being sworn in---some of his business have seen rocketing income.

Democrats have been pushed to divest of far smaller businesses, but Trump has gotten a pass by establishment politicians and the media alike, for no particularly good reason.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1313827415890690048) [Bust 'Em All: Let's De-Monopolize Tech, Telecoms AND Entertainment](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/bust-em-all-lets-de-monopolize-tech-telecoms-and-entertainment) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation

 > ...we've lived through two entwined experiments: the Internet...and the consumer welfare standard, and its bedrock idea that monopolies are not harmful unless prices increase.

It's worth pointing out that the EFF was not so recently attacked for pulling its punches with the big-tech companies that provide most of their funding, so it's nice to see them stepping up where it matters.

Something went wrong with the posting, here.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1314189048890580992) [Mice poop shows gut bacteria is key to sleep](https://www.futurity.org/gut-microbiome-sleep-apnea-2446182-2/) from Futurity

 > ...mice who received transplants from the intermittent hypoxia group slept longer and slept more often during their normal period of wakefulness...

As people are realizing that their quarantine diets have been useless, it's worth thinking about the long-term effects on health due to lost sleep.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1314551939926024197) [A Proud Boys Supporter Was Arrested Hours After Trump Told the Group to ‘Stand By’](https://www.vice.com/en/article/935x9e/portland-cops-arrested-a-proud-boy-supporter-hours-after-trump-told-the-group-to-stand-by) from VICE News

 > ...charges include assault, attempted assault, unlawful use of tear gas, unlawful use of a weapon, and pointing a firearm at another person...

Since that article was published last week, there has also been a right-wing plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan.

 > When the peoples shut themselves up in the silence of their souls, they instill fear in the greatest despots on earth.

###### Pedro Albizu Campos

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Restoring Democracy During the Pandemic Requires a Modernized Approach to Activate Voters (OPINION)](https://www.latinorebels.com/2020/10/01/restoringdemocracypandemic/) from Latino Rebels

 > ...we must create an inclusive political system by educating and engaging the population of voters who have been historically excluded from political conversations and electoral decisions.

When trying to figure out how to improve voting rights, it's *always* worth listening to the people who can't vote, by definition.  This is just one example.
