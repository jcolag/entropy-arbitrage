Happy üçÇ autumnal---or vernal, for those of you in the Southern Hemisphere---equinox, everyone...

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > There is no doubt that education elevates the woman. The woman who possesses some knowledge always tries to keep herself at a certain moral level that helps her greatly in the fight for life, by making her better, more pure, and by guiding her steps along the path of virtue.

I feel like I say this sort of thing a lot, but seriously, look at how much effort it takes to make authoritarianism look even mildly useful.  Billions of dollars laundered through an unknown number of organizations, combined with decades of biased electoral maps and numerous campaigns to shift public opinion in their favor, and they can still only *barely* put their plans into motion.

I honestly didn't know that the Marion situation had so many overlapping issues.  If you didn't, then you'll probably want to read this.

I don't think that I can add much to this.  I've watched the privatization movement run around the country, and can't think of a single instance of where it has benefitted anyone except the new owner.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The researchers took the DNA from I. sakaiensis that is responsible for producing the enzymes that break down plastic, and incorporated that genetic sequence into a plasmid.

This, if repeatable, could change a lot about the world fairly quickly.

 > While today observers perceive Judaism as a religion, Jewish culture is not focused on individual belief and worship so much as on an entire community and its collective relationship with God and its history.

To those celebrating, this past and next week, I hope that *your* community gets the most out of it.

 > The anniversary of her death was marked Saturday by a strong military presence and a general strike by tradespeople and shopkeepers in Kurdish cities across numerous provinces of Iran ‚Äî along with protest rallies in cities worldwide.

A general strike, if it gains momentum, could become huge.  No matter how oppressive the government, when people stop buying and selling, they quickly see how little power that they have.  Fingers crossed, they could see some important change...
