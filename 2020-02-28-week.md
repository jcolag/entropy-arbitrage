Not added to Twitter for space reasons:  The illustrated books are licensed non-commercial (not Free Culture), so I probably won't review them in any depth.  But you can find the first three issues listed under *Children's Books* on the [BASAbali Wiki Library](https://dictionary.basabali.org/Library), written in Balinese and translated to Indonesian, Nepali, and English.
