## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Rightful Heir

For those keeping track of how the entire franchise fits together, since last week, the **DS9** crew have their fantasies run amok, in *If Wishes Were Horses*.  This episode, meanwhile, focuses mostly on Klingon culture, so don't expect to get too far into depth, here.

 > **RIKER**: Sorry I missed it.

Smug shuttle-trash, mocking his colleague for daring to not have his interests.  In a deleted scene, the charmer randomly trash-talks Worf behind his back to get Picard to yell at him, too.

 > **WORF**: Ever since I returned from the Carraya system, I have felt empty.

He means the penal colony in [*Birthright*]({% post_url 2025-03-06-birthright-1 %}).

 > **PICARD**: Inexcusable...and understandable. It may be that what you are looking for cannot be found here on the *Enterprise*. Perhaps you need to immerse yourself in Klingon beliefs in order to discover whether they can hold any truths for you. Is there something you can do, is there somewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully?

Did Picard strongly suggest that Worf go away and stop bothering him...?  I don't disagree that he probably needs a vacation to deal with his issues, but this feels like the worst way to make the case.

 > **DIVOK**: Kahless! I see Kahless! He is standing before me with a sword. He wants something. Me. He wants me! He wants me to go with him!

You might recognize this random Klingon as [Charles/Chip Esten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Esten), who has made appearances on all sorts of shows, but has mostly made his name in the improv comedy world.

 > **KOROTH**: It is a powerful vision you have had, Divok. Kahless wants you to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You are only nineteen and yet your place among the honored dead is already secure. Take him back to his chamber. Let him sleep.

By contrast, you might recognize Koroth as---or at least his voice as belonging to---[Alan Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Oppenheimer), who has had a long career, but people my age probably mostly recognize the name as the voice of Skeletor (among many others) in **He-Man and the Masters of the Universe** and related properties.

 > **KAHLESS**: I am Kahless, and I have returned.

I don't recognize him, myself, but to complete the set, I might as well point out that [Kevin Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Conway_%28actor%29) plays Kahless, in the middle of another long career.

 > **RIKER**: Worf, no offense, but I have trouble believing that the man I that escorted to deck eight is supernatural.

I mean, he rolled his eyes moments before, and nobody says "no offense" and then says something inoffensive, so...

 > **DATA**: Faith? Then you do believe Kahless may have supernatural attributes? As an android, I am unable to accept that which cannot be proven through rational means. I would appreciate hearing your insights on this matter.

Can't he accept those things?  I doubt that he has rationally proven his existence, the validity of his senses, his consciousness, and so forth.  We found out in [*Quality of Life*]({% post_url 2025-01-16-quality-life %}) that he doesn't even know of an accepted definition of life, but he considers himself alive.

 > **GOWRON**: What kind of fools do you have working for you, Picard? The impostor's been aboard for nearly a day.

I always enjoy it when we get these little insights into how the rest of the galaxy sees the Federation, after Picard constantly patting himself on the back every episode.

By the way, we last saw bug-eyed Gowron in [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-07-04-unification-part-2 %}), I believe, if anybody wanted to keep track of such things.

 > **DATA**: Yes. The Starfleet officers who first activated me on Omicron Theta told me I was an android, nothing more than a sophisticated machine with human form. However, I realized that if I were simply a machine, I could never be anything else. I could never grow beyond my programming. I found that difficult to accept, so I chose to believe that I was a person, that I had the potential to be more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors. It is a belief which I still hold.

First, we now see specifics on how the Federation treats representatives from minority groups.  Also, though, why give Data the pointless line---that I called out---about an inability to accept anything not rationally proven, if even he knows that his fundamental identity comes from faith.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, this episode doesn't have much for us to work with.

### The Bad

Nobody seems to have a problem with Riker speaking dismissively to or about his non-human colleagues.  Similarly, Picard seems to give one of those same officers leave by trying to trick them into leaving.  And Data outlines the awful ways that people treated him when he gained consciousness.

Data, meanwhile, appears to lie about his experience of faith, claiming to have no way of accepting unproven ideas, then turning around and indicating that his entire life springs from a leap of faith.

And we again see how people outside the Federation see the alleged best-and-brightest aboard the ship, dismissing them as lazy fools.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when somebody somehow decided that we didn't have enough Riker, in *Second Chances*.
