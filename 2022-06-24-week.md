I considered writing something about the Supreme Court decisions, here.  However, that comment quickly grew, so I'll turn it into a Sunday post.  In any case...

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > More than merely the value of forgoing sex until marriage, purity culture centers sexual purity as a primary measure of the value of young women, who need to remain "pure" to attract a godly man in marriage.

You'll also find a critical sex abuse scandal/cover-up going on in this story, but societies primarily use these "purity" ideas to control women---I've often said that the word *slut* basically means "someone who feels more comfortable in her sexuality than me, and I don't like that," after all---and it invariably supports xenophobia.  The Ku Klux Klan refers to itself as an organization built around chivalry, for example, and they *mean* that they want to protect what they see as a woman's honor (by which they mean virginity) from what they see as a threat, non-white people.

 > The study indicated the combination of increasing ALAN with rising temperatures intensifies the early start to spring for many urban plants.

It surprises me that nobody has done this research before.  Growing up, I remember many studies indicating that flowering and fruiting took its primary cues from the hours of light in a day.  That makes sense, given that nothing else on the "calendar" triggers nearly as many reactions in a plant as light.

In any case, for people with allergies who don't understand why they've gotten worse over the last century, now you know (partly) why.

 > The Daoyin jing lists the six healing breaths (he, si, hu, xu, chui, and xi), each associated with a particular organ and set of ailments.

I suppose that it makes sense that so many cultures have developed similar ideas, but I still found the story interesting.

 > They found that Native American and Canadian First Nations communities speak different English dialects, but many share similar patterns of pitch, rhythm and intonation --- features that linguists call prosody, the "music" of language.

I see an irony in this story, in that we all *recognize* this accent, but probably more from decades of white actors playing offensive stereotypes, rather than from exposure to indigenous cultures.

 > We need big investments in public housing, rent control, and down payment assistance for first-time buyers from marginalized backgrounds to ameliorate historical injustices and address the current crisis.

I don't fully agree with the article, because it reeks of "let's not make this about race" when we *need* to make it about race to make any real progress, but we could probably consider many of the policy proposals "evergreen," in addition to improving racist policies.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Boy, gig companies sure hire disastrously sloppy lawyers](https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/15/simple-as-abc/#a-big-ask) from Pluralistic

 > With just months to go until the election, the Massachusetts supreme court unanimously ruled that the worker misclassification initiative is so badly drafted that it can't appear on the ballot.

This happens more frequently than most of us expect.  Culture constantly messages us that fascists and abusers have their acts together more than anyone else, that they work dispassionately and intelligently to achieve their goals.  And yet, we see them fall on their faces, over and over, because they can't exercise any self-control.  We see this everywhere from the gig economy to Trump to the right-wing members of the Supreme Court, all of them assuming that their side already took over the country and that they can ignore rules and etiquette.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A Mayan spiritual guide accused of 'witchcraft' in Guatemala, later released](https://globalvoices.org/2022/06/15/a-mayan-spiritual-guide-accused-of-witchcraft-in-guatemala-later-released/) from Global Voices

 > He also mentioned that for a long time the ancestral councils had been the guardians of the hills and the rivers, although they are no longer seen that way by the society.

I admittedly haven't followed this story deeply, but it sounds suspiciously like the government drew a line from popular protests against their policies to the role of mysticism in historic protests, and so decided to make an example of this man.
