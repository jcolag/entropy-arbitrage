[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1217808976177295360) [Raising the minimum wage just $1 would cause suicide rates to drop](https://www.fastcompany.com/90448771/raising-minimum-wage-just-1-would-cause-suicide-rates-to-drop) from Fast Company

 > ...the study saw no effect between minimum wage increases and the suicide rates of those with a college education or higher, and that strengthens this study’s evidence...

I didn't have space to mention this in the tweet, but it's worth pointing out *somewhere* that the House of Representatives passed a [minimum wage bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/house-passes-raise-the-wage-act-15-per-hour-minimum-wage-bill.html) back in July of 2019, but it's one of the [hundreds of bills](https://www.newsweek.com/senator-mcconnell-democrats-emulating-trump-senate-1476406) waiting for Mitch McConnell to bring to the Senate floor.

It's difficult to not bring partisan politics in an issue when one party is literally sitting on a law that would provably save lives.

 > Experts worry the practice will allow campaigns to suppress the vote or say different things, possibly opposing things, to different people.

Again, not mentioned in the tweet for space reasons, but whenever these Facebook manipulation issues come up, it's worth a reminder that Zuckerberg [almost certainly](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-zuckerberg-president-20170120-story.html) wants to run for President, at some point, and already has a [stated bias](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/01/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-will-go-to-the-mat-to-fight-warrens-company-breakup-efforts/).
