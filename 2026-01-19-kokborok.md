This rushes to the margins to finally dig up a holiday, but we have one:  Today, in Tripura, India, people observe [Kokborok Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokborok_Day), celebrating one of the state's official language.

We also observe [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) here in the United States, but much as I appreciate any excuse to honor the man, his work, and his often-ignored inspirations, we celebrate it on the third Monday of the month, so I have frequently leaned on it in lieu of more variety.

And on to the week's projects.

## Social Media

This may fall by the wayside, may even have ended before it begins due to other developments during the week, but you can now [follow me on Wafrn](https://app.wafrn.net/blog/jcolag).  Why another Fediverse account?

In short, [Wafrn has **native Bluesky Integration**](https://wafrn.net/faq/user.html#blueskyIntegration), in their words.  While Bluesky increasingly builds away from their protocol, further centralizing the network even as they pretend to work at decentralizing it, this would allow me to interact with people there without dealing with their rolling out the red carpet for right-wing personalities while banning transgender people criticizing them.  And it should allow people there to find me, even if they somehow still find the Fediverse more objectionable even as it embraces the Trump administration and (other) right-wing organizations.  This move, if I understand it, should make me available to people there without ever needing to soil my hands on their "Twitter from ten years ago, as if anybody liked it" mess.

And wouldn't you know it?  *Right* after I signed up, Bluesky welcomed United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) onto their service and the CEO took pains to announce that they would happily support Donald Trump, too.  Maybe I won't bother, then, because while I could *maybe* justify touching "usual corporate social media bad" Bluesky with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole, we all know that the community over there can only get worse, past this point, and soliciting opinions from the local Nazi bar doesn't sound appealing.

Side note:  Gosh, if only we had a social network actually run by the people, true to the intent of decentralizing, billionaire-proof, and quick to cut off outright authoritarians.  Maybe we should ask around on the Fediverse to see if anybody knows where to find that, so that people can stop jumping from abusive corporation to abusive corporation...

At the moment, then, I don't really know what this account will become, if anything.  I originally assumed that I would do the usual blog announcements and see if any interesting people showed up to talk to, but as things stand...maybe not.

Either way, if you already follow [my Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag)---or [Diaspora](https://nota.404.mn/people/e4313920967a0136074b076893c08a76), [Spoutible](https://spoutible.com/jcolag), [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/@jcolag), or [Sez Us](https://sez.us/user/jcolag), for that matter---then this shouldn't matter to you.  If you desperately want to contact me from Bluesky, though, now you can, and maybe that'll convince me that I erred in my assessment.

## Entropy Arbitrage, the Posts

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-posts %}

Continuing the process of adding labels to old posts---and not picking up any speed on it, to my deep irritation---[developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) posts have the projects identified as far back as August 2023.  I decided to call changes to both the blog's code and its posts as [work on the blog](/blog/tag/blog), which I may come to regret, but it does the job for now.

## Entropy Arbitrage, the Code

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

For yesterday's post on [how I use AI professionally]({% post_url 2026-01-18-using-ai %}), I realized that the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library needed a different setup for modern versions.  I don't believe that it affected any posts, but it seemed better to catch these issues before they cause a problem.

Similarly, for the graph, I finally created a generic [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) plugin, rather than the goofy thing that I created previously that could only handle line charts and took the data from an external file.

## Next

I would expect most of this week to go back to adding labels to old posts.  In the early days, I believe that some posts already have tags with the project, so I may not need to go back to the beginning, but we'll see.
