This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading **Cairn**, focusing on *Knowledge and Perception* to the end.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Cairn, Warden Guide

The game's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn) has the following to say.

 > Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). There are two editions (see sidebar) both of which are rules-compatible.

The game also lists the following principles, which might give a clearer idea of how to interpret things.

 > ### Neutrality
 >
 > The Warden's role is to act as a neutral arbiter and portray the rules, situations, non-player characters (NPCs), and narrative clearly.
 >
 > ### Classless
 >
 > A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, and their experiences define their specialty.
 >
 > ### Death
 >
 > Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.
 >
 > ### Fiction First
 >
 > Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are based on in-world elements and arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players.
 >
 > ### Growth
 >
 > Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
 >
 > ### Player Choice
 >
 > Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.
 >
 > ### Principles
 >
 > The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.
 >
 > ### Shared Objectives
 >
 > Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

It continues on that way, but you get the general idea.

## What Works Well?

This iteration of the [*Vald*](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/vald/) section finally gives the impression of the world as more than an abstract idea for a setting.  It still keeps things mostly abstract, but the calendar, factions, and religions give the place some much-needed texture.  Add to that the [relics](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/reliquary/), talk about [names](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/naming-procedures/) of things, and so forth, and you can sort of get a sense for how the place should feel.

These sections also reiterate the commitment that the game has to telling the story rather than focusing on mechanical details, which I don't see much in the Free Culture space.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

You might have better luck, but some sections feel incomprehensible to me, at least from the perspective of figuring out what to do with the information.  For example, the [*Pointcrawls*](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/pointcrawls/) section seems to describe a "preferred" mapping technique, but gives no indication as to why the gaming group should care one way or another.

## Opportunities

The aforementioned repository says the following.

 > This is a game that values community contributions! If you'd like to submit an adventure, hack, monster, or conversion take a look at the [submission guide](https://cairnrpg.com/submissions/submission-guide/).

I won't bother to quote their page on the topic...

## What's Adaptable?

This section---as mentioned---greatly expands the sense of Vald, provides spells and relics, and includes more tables for randomly creating various aspects of the world.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll read *Solar Spirits*, *Emergent Requests*, and *Self Image*, by Matthew DeBlock.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game's world so far?
