## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, once again.  **The Next Generation**, and therefore its intrusion into this **Enterprise** episode, takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect identical politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series far less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## These Are The Voyages...

I briefly considered handling this episode alongside [*The Pegasus*]({% post_url 2025-08-14-pegasus %}), either as a separate post or for the [newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), but couldn't find the time.  And I probably had motivation problems, considering that I didn't care for **Enterprise**, and I gather that fans of **Enterprise** hate this episode for largely the reasons that I considered looking at it.

Why now?  As I have mentioned, I don't envision myself slogging through four seasons of this show, since the Federation doesn't exist during it, making it useless for working out the Federation's culture, meaning that it floats out there like the Mediocre Episode of Damocles.  And since we talked about [**Nemesis**]({% post_url 2026-01-15-nemesis-1 %}) over the past two weeks, in *our* timeline, this would come next with nothing of relevance in between.

Anyway, to continue the "bit" from the last year or so of posting:  Since last we met, the franchise continued what at least felt like a nosedive.  When **Voyager** ended in 2001, it also marked the end of a fourteen-year semi-continuous (though mostly episodic) story that started with [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), followed by (as mentioned) **Nemesis** capping off twenty-fourth century stories, at least at the time.  More importantly, **Deep Space Nine** may have asked too much of the audience at the time, and **Voyager** had all sorts of problems, leading to declining viewership.

**Enterprise** tried to reset the franchise, initially.  They removed the words "Star Trek" from the title.  They parted with the tradition of jazz-inspired neoclassical music, replacing it with an existing soft-rock song.  And they tried to give everything a more real-world/NASA-inspired look-and-feel.  As every franchise does eventually, they wanted to make it more approachable to new audiences, especially those who hadn't watched the previous fourteen years of television during their formative years, but without actually changing anything.

It...didn't work[^2XEAR0].  And like **Discovery** would about twenty years later, the writers seemed to scramble for a checklist of "things nerds like," first focusing stories on explaining things from other shows that nobody needed explained, then renaming the show to insert "Star Trek" back in and adjusting the trade dress to slightly match, and then episodes like this that begged the dwindling audience to come back by tying things as tightly as possible to earlier shows.  And (to nobody's surprise) *that* didn't work, either.

[^2XEAR0]:  It never works.  Franchises should *absolutely* pursue new fans, but "let's keep the stench of gatekeeping fandom by packing everything full of inside references, but slightly retool the aesthetics in hopes of tricking new people into showing up" won't work, because it doesn't offer the prospective new audience anything significantly different.  Viewers could already pretend that they actually named **TNG** "Picard Sharks" or what have you, and used a cover of---I skimmed through contemporary music and turned up exactly the right song for the show, I suspect---Whitesnake's *Here I Go Again* as the theme song.  They keep trying to pitch the same show, but set in a different century or location, and maybe pick a captain that looks different, instead of rethinking the colonial/militarist focus.

All that preamble to say that, when this episode aired in 2005, Paramount had also started approaching the end of its runway to produce another film if it wanted to retain the movie rights after a string of failures, meaning that the franchise looked pretty thoroughly dead.  Yes, Paramount had started negotiating for more time on their contract and bringing together the production team for the reboot film, but "studio might make another franchise installment in a few years" doesn't exactly feel like vitality.

Tacking the episode on now, then, as something of an adjunct to **Nemesis** instead of trying to remember whether anybody might care in seven years---around when we should wrap up **Voyager**---seems smarter, especially given the casting choices.

 > **RIKER**: First Officer's Personal Log, Stardate 47457.1. With the unexpected arrival of Admiral Pressman, my old CO, I find myself in an awkward position. Counselor Troi has suggested I might get a few insights by calling up an historic holo-program.

I know, shocking that the therapist phoned in her work and told her patient to go play video games, instead.  Well, technically, I suppose that she suggested watching *Star Trek*, not playing video games, but I think that the point still stands.

Oh, and as an internal version of "the bit," since a different last time, Riker left the meeting during *The Pegasus* where Pressman says that "the Chief of Starfleet Security has personally given me her assurance of complete support."  I guess that we pick Riker up shortly before they get trapped inside the asteroid, given that one of the attempts to leave has the same stardate in Picard's log.

Anyway, this appears to answer the question of how some people have become familiar with the activities of past ships to a creepy degree:  Somebody has animated the adventures into propaganda pieces.

 > **TROI**: Have you learned anything on the Holodeck about breaking orders?

Oh, she sent him to watch *Star Trek* for its education on emotional intelligence.  People do always compare **Enterprise** with **Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood**, right?

No reason, really.  I can't think of any current goings-on in the world where governments have asked the military and militarized police to follow illegal orders and [threatened people who suggested that you have a right and duty to refuse](https://www.independent.org/article/2025/12/02/trump-threatens-mark-kelly-for-reiterating-the-militarys-obligation-to-the-constitution/).  I didn't actually expect Mark Kelly to show up twice in the post, or at all in *any* post, but there you go.

Well, OK, that sounds more like a Green Lantern deal, but I have only watched a couple of episodes of the show, so I don't have the voice down for their strategy songs, couldn't figure out how to fit the sentiment into a couplet, and you all see what I wanted to get at...

 > **RIKER**: Not yet. I've gone back a couple of days earlier to get a perspective. But I really don't see how this is going to help.
 >
 > **TROI**: That's why you run a star-ship, and I'm a counselor.

He...*doesn't* run a star-ship at this point, does he?  Maybe we should take that as the key to understanding the joke, because I also don't really know if she does any actual counseling.  Granted, I haven't gone to much therapy, but "go watch **Enterprise**" doesn't sound like how to do it.

 > **RIKER**: Reed's shorter than I thought he'd be.
 >
 > **TROI**: Maybe the program's off.
 >
 > **RIKER**: No, I'm sure it's fine. It's just...you expect larger than life people to be larger than life.

Maybe apocryphal, but I vaguely remember reading that this era of the franchise---maybe a lot of live-action media where they could get away with it---built the sets to a ninety-percent scale, to give the performers more of a physical presence on the screen.  This *might* refer to that, in addition to the cliché of famous people looking shorter in person.  I couldn't confirm my memory, though, since searching turns up various model kits, because who else would care about scales of sets...?  {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **TROI**: Has the Andorian hailed them?

Hey, "the Andorian" plays something like half the characters in your universe[^ZcQHz8], lady.  You treat him with respect...

[^ZcQHz8]:  Since I don't think that he'll appear in any parts of the episode that we care about, guest star [Jeffrey Combs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Combs), after about a decade known for horror roles, and auditioning for a couple of **Next Generation** roles (including Riker), would land a couple of one-off roles in **Deep Space Nine**, two of which became consistently recurring due to positive fan response.  He would later go on to one-off roles in **Voyager** and **Enterprise**, plus the recurring Andorian in question, and then the voice of a recurring computer character on **Lower Decks**, I believe more than forty episodes so far, more than some entire shows got...

 > **TROI**: You might want to leap ahead to that point. It's where things start really happening. And you should consider taking over the galley.

Once again, probably for the last time with this crew, I have to wonder if they wrote this as a self-aware line to taunt us.

You have to remember that, as the franchise started at least appearing to circle the drain, the writers not only treat us to this *riveting* scene of casually walking through an empty hallway, but they do so with a scene *from a different show* that nobody watching this signed up for, while talking about skipping ahead to the expletives-redacted point.  Physician, heal thyself, and all that.

As I have said a few times, I only watched **Enterprise** somewhere in the last decade or so, and didn't care for it, but even I realize that making your series finale about the emotional arc of characters from a different show won't go down too well...

 > **TROI**: Well, Starfleet ships didn't have counselors in those days, but the chef on the first Enterprise came pretty close. I read almost everybody confided in him.

Do they have counselors in *these* days?  I feel the need to ask, again, because we usually only see her treating her alleged patients like this, the aforementioned video game solution.  And on the rare cases that we have seen her in an actual session---[*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}) most prominently---they show her making it absolutely clear that she doesn't care about anybody's psychological health.  A chef would seem like an upgrade.

 > **RIKER**: Pull up a chair. I could use the company. I heard a rumor I may be whipping up some Andorian cabbage soup tonight.

Note that Riker seems to think that the chef gets to boss people (well, women) around.  And to nobody's surprise, I would hope, he doesn't understand that you don't force professionals to socialize with you.

 > **RIKER**: Looks like a catfish. I'm hoping it tastes like one. Commander Tucker's crazy for catfish. Do you ever miss him?

And now he has questions about her sex life.

 > **RIKER**: Computer, freeze program. Thanks.

And to top this scene off, he freezes the sequence to kiss her, a totally normal action that definitely doesn't make him look like a predator taking advantage of his target's inability to fight back, with or without the context of prying into her sex life.

Then we get a paging-through of the *Pegasus* crew, including Cdr Ronald Moore---no word on whether he has any relationship with the hack comedian from [*The Outrageous Okona*]({% post_url 2022-12-15-outrageous-okona %})---LT Dawn Velazquez, CN Eric Motz, CN Andy Simonson, and ENS Phil Wallace.  I believe that all of them work on the show to some extent.

 > **RIKER**: Phil Wallace. Hell of a handball player. Pressman was getting ready to promote him.

I guess that people still play handball, I assume that they mean the [American variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_handball) or a variation, not one of the team sports by that name that generally look more like association football.  You'd need enough other enthusiasts, after all, to form teams to judge his ability, if we mean other handballs.

 > **RIKER**: Seventy-one, all but nine of us.
 >
 > **TROI**: How do you feel about learning the ship wasn't destroyed?
 >
 > **RIKER**: What difference does it make? Seventy-one people died.

We did get the nine survivors from *The Pegasus*.

Anyway, this scene drags on with awkward "what do you think?"-style dialogue and reviewing what we've seen.  Riker does see it as a problem that dozens of people died, though.

 > **RIKER**: No, I haven't made it to engineering yet. Have you spent any time on the NX-01?
 >
 > **TROI**: I've never run the program.

Wait, what?  If she hasn't gone through this, then what made her think that it could help Riker with his...desire to violate illegal orders, I think?  Honestly, this feels like "well, what do *you* think it all means?" writing, but with core plot, instead of metaphor or endings.

 > **TROI**: I have an appointment in an hour.

Oh, leave a sign on the door telling them to listen to **Fibber McGee and Molly**, for its "therapeutic value," and nobody'll even notice the difference...

 > **TROI**: How could Archer survive without a fish tank?

Do they think that every captain has the same interests?  Wait, *does* every captain in their time have the same interests?  I could certainly imagine a survey to fill out when gunning for a promotion.  It could ask to check all approved hobbies and extracurricular activities.

- [ ] Ableist slurs
- [ ] Authoritarians (wearing blazers)
- [ ] Detective fiction
- [ ] Exotic fish
- [ ] Fascism
- [ ] Genealogy
- [ ] Genocide
- [ ] Hair
- [ ] Horseback riding
- [ ] Hypocritical moralizing
- [ ] May-December romances (if I get to be December)
- [ ] Pillaging heritage sites
- [ ] Replicas (models or line art) of old ships
- [ ] Shakespeare (plays, in English)
- [ ] Shakespeare (plays, in the original Klingon)
- [ ] Shakespeare (sonnets and other material)
- [ ] Squash
- [ ] Tea (Earl Grey (hot))
- [ ] Thinking about the Roman Empire

And you need to get a certain percentage of them before anybody will talk to you about the promotion.

I presented this as an extended joke, but this does fit with what we saw during the series in terms of ergonomics.  If you can't imagine somebody comfortable in a different temperature range than you as we saw in [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}) among other episodes, or a culture that doesn't request water at specific temperatures Celsius such as in [*The Defector*]({% post_url 2023-07-06-defector %}), then it doesn't seem *that* far a leap to assume that everybody in a job acts exactly like your friend who happens to work in the same job.

Also, Troi has apparently never seen a non-automatic door, because she seems stumped on how to leave the room.

 > **TROI**: Perhaps Archer wasn't as fussy as Captain Picard when it came to people sitting in his chair.

Notice that they do note Picard's authoritarian deficiencies, but only behind his back.  Do they worry about retaliation?

 > **TUCKER**: I pretty much built this engine. Plan to take care of it as long as I can. Been a Hell of a run, Malcolm, never thought it would come to an end.

Sorry to break form and touch the **Enterprise** portions of this, but I can't help myself on this scene.

To wit:  Yes, yes, a Hell of a run.  It's been a long road, gettin' from there to here, or some nonsense to that effect.  We get it...

 > **REED**: [All good things]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}). Captain thinks there'll be another *Enterprise* before too long.

They should've let this line continue, to see if he can also wedge in the names of the other series finales.  "At times like this, it all comes down to *What We Leave Behind*, after completing the *Endgame*, and...I...we...*Turnabout Intruder*!"

 > **TROI**: It's sad. Commander Tucker had no idea he wouldn't make it back.

How do you get this nonsensical with so few words?

Most prominent, most people generally don't receive advance notice about when they'll die...or get left behind at a rest stop bathroom, I don't remember what happens to Tucker, and it doesn't make a difference to the post.  They have had many colleagues die in front of them, and none of them walked into the scene suggesting that they'll need to cancel their dinner reservations.

Ignoring that, though, they live in an experimental spaceship, which often flies into territory held by governments that don't appreciate trespassers, but do have powerful weapons.  I guarantee that everybody on that ship, if remotely realistic, would have a pretty good sense that they probably won't make it home.  They put it out of their minds so that it doesn't distract them, but unless Tucker dies in a city down on a planet, choking on a hot dog from a food truck, he probably has a fairly clear idea of what could happen...

 > **TROI**: He's cute.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Don't get any ideas.

This would come off as creepy even if their relationship from [**Insurrection**]({% post_url 2026-01-01-insurrection-1 %}) had started, but comes off far creepier when you realize that she had started seeing Worf at the end of [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}), the episode before.  And that ignores his creepy interaction with the T'Pol hologram, which seems like it should render his opinions on who gets to find these simulations arousing irrelevant.

 > **TROI**: Reg'll be furious if I'm late. Are you going to stay?

Barclay, I believe, shows up a few times near the end of **Voyager** alongside these two, so the writers probably wanted to reference that for some reason or other, but we last saw him in [*Genesis*]({% post_url 2025-10-02-genesis %}).

 > **T'POL**: Do you ever miss me?

Wait, did Riker's invasive questions, at Troi's prompting, affect the "story"?  That seems like it defeats the entire point of the exercise, if it changes aspects of the history on the fly.

 > **DATA**: You may check me for rain if you like, Counselor, but I assure you there is no water in my---

I guess that we'll cram in the entire crew doing shtick, if this drags on long enough.

Honestly, I often find myself wondering how this franchise makes its casting decisions.  Do they love these few characters so much that they keep looking for reasons to stuff their performers into new shows, or do the performers show up to the studio every day making sad puppy dog eyes at people until they land another job?  I can't imagine that any writers structed the story around Troi and Riker, *and* wrote in a voice-only part for Data, because anything in the *plot* demanded it.

 > **RIKER**: What do you know about the Treaty of Algeron?
 >
 > **TROI**: 2311. It redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone.

In case you wanted some background on the treaty before they blather on telling us things that they already said aloud during *The Pegasus*.

By the way, did I mention that Algeron IV gets a mention in [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %})?  No guarantees, but presumably they signed the treaty there or nearby.

 > **RIKER**: Did you ever find yourself attracted to him?

Twice, you notice, Riker has asked about somebody's sex life, and what a coincidence, he did that with the two women in the cast.  But wait, maybe we have only really seen those interrogations in any detail.  Well...

 > **RIKER**: If I remember correctly, that's when---
 >
 > **PHLOX**: Their romance began? Precisely. One time, he became so exhausted I had to demand he get six hours sleep. He negotiated it down to four. A very stubborn young man.

A third time, but with the twist that he asks a *man* about one of the women's sex lives.  Yes, he couches it as technically asking about Tucker, but re-read the answer.  I guess that we'll never figure out what this pattern might suggest...

Also, note that the computer---one imagines that the computer runs the simulation, after all---has no qualms about discussing opinions about a woman's libido with whoever asks.

 > **TUCKER**: You mean, getting back to San Francisco? Nah, he won't let anything get in the way of that. Trust me. Can you spare one of those carrots?
 >
 > **RIKER**: They're not peeled yet.

What kind of weirdo warns people about unpeeled carrots?  First, most people can generally figure that out on sight or by touch.  Second, carrots don't really have peels, only outer layers that don't look mathematically perfect and have a slightly rougher texture, so anybody with sense eats them unpeeled unless they plan to purée them for something else or want a specific visual presentation.  You should scrub dirt off your carrots before eating them, sure, but one imagines that the spaceship where everything gets tossed around in any emergency doesn't grow these in flats of soil.

 > **TUCKER**: I can count on one hand the number of people I trust. I don't mean trust like I trust you aren't lying to me or, I trust you won't steal my money. I'm talking about the kind of trust where you know someone's not going to hurt you, no matter what. Where you know they'll always be there for you, no matter how bad things get. You ever know anybody like that?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Yeah. One or two. 

And there we go, the punchline of this mess:  Rather than worry about legality or hierarchy, go with personal loyalty, the thing that all the **TNG** characters always do.  What an amazing twist...

## Quick Commentary

Heh, after all that build-up, I can't help noticing that none of this story---the story that Riker watches, I mean---has anything to do with disobeying orders, maybe answering my question earlier about how Troi came up with it as a solution to Riker's problem:  She picked it at random and hoped that it'd do the job.  I suppose that, technically, Archer may have disobeyed orders by taking the minor detour for Blue Jeffrey Combs, but Picard did things like that all the time with even less justification, so it barely even registers.

I don't really have anything more to say than that.  It certainly mystifies me that the writers thought that setting this years after the main series, and centering the episode on a ten-minute crime drama, and filling the episode with imaginary deleted scenes from an episode of another show, *and* doesn't even give us this important speech that they wanted us to care so much about.  But I don't have anything to say about it beyond that.

If I had to pick out a weirdest aspect, though, I'd need to point to how the **TNG** fan-fiction part doesn't even shed any light on *The Pegasus* plot.  It presents itself as a [**Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead) (but not funny and far less educated), shoving the bigger plot "backstage" while centering the original off-stage plot, with an expectation that it has some insight into that story to give us, teeing up that Riker needs some specific experience to convince him to admit that he has spent over a decade complying with an illegal order and so covering up his complicity in a crime, possibly (as mentioned when discussing that episode) murdering his colleagues.  But it doesn't comment on the earlier episode or contribute anything new, often copying lines almost verbatim with only slight variations in context.

Oh, and I should probably note that, since modern *Star Trek* desperately wants to feel "in on the joke," they wrote a **Very Short Treks** episode, [*Holograms All the Way Down*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPCGkHjsK9M)[^756q8V] (two minutes), that spins directly out of the ending of this story.  Like this episode, I have no idea if that one has an actual point, beyond "making fun of what you make fun of maybe makes us cool," but...it exists, and it would feel wrong not to mention it, given the direct connection to the current topic.

[^756q8V]:  Also, even more tangentially than the rest of this, notice that characters from **Prodigy** have a quick appearance, so it already existed at this point in production, but the show doesn't get grouped into "Star Trek Animation" at the end.  It seems a bit telling, doesn't it...?

If you want to wash the taste of that out of your mouth, calling back to the crack about "the Andorian," if you can still tolerate some Christmas music, I'd recommend [*Here Comes Jeffrey Combs*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26H_xWocEss).

## Conclusions

We got a *lot* more out of this than I ever expected, including the handball thing and clarification on the treaty, considering that we really only watched the framing sequence of a different series.  Granted, I hated almost the entire thing, but I've enjoyed episodes less...

### The Good

While we have gone back to not expressing grief, nor does he acknowledge his role in the event, Riker at least acknowledges that he'd prefer to not have dozens of dead colleagues.

### The Bad

We continue to see that they see therapy as little more than sending people to watch TV.  They apparently don't even review the television in question.  This particular therapist talks a lot about the existence of her job in lieu of doing it.

The episode makes it abundantly clear that they find speculating about women having sex entirely appropriate official conversation, with the computer seemingly maintaining files with such speculation.  Riker, in particular, also sees women as servants and sex objects.  He starts that behavior in the simulation, but also treats Troi like his property, even as she has (in chronological order) started a relationship with somebody else.

People seem to have no useful theory of mind.  They especially show no understanding that other people might have a different set of experiences leading to different knowledge.  And they can't really envision different kinds of people holding similar roles.

While they recognize the hierarchical, authoritarian streak in their own lives, they only want to talk about it behind the backs of leadership.  And we see once again that they all prize personal loyalty over any other consideration.

### The Weird

The episode implies that at least some people routinely watch reenactments of missions conducted by other ships.  And those reenactments also seem to change based on the viewer's participation.

Automation seems so pervasive that some people have forgotten how to open doors.

They don't seem to like the idea of eating unpeeled root vegetables.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in seven days, when we take one last side-trip on this run, checking out the few parts of 2009's **Star Trek** that occur in this universe.
