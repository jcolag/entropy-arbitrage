This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **Aumyr**, from the geography of *Laendil* to the *Figli di Hardon* organization.

Before we get started, I probably should have mentioned this *last* week, but for those of you "tuning in (to the blog post) live," you might want to know that you can find people out celebrating [Software Freedom Day](https://digitalfreedoms.org/en/sfd) today.  I have no plans of attending any, especially since it looks like I'd need to travel at least a few hundred miles to get to the nearest one, but I've heard good things about the group behind the celebration.

Judging by [the SFD overview](https://digitalfreedoms.org/en/software-freedom-day/blog/sfd-2024) people started celebrating last week, and plan to continue to at least early October.

## Back to Our Regularly Scheduled Post

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Aumyr**
 * Location:  <https://www.aumyr.world/en/>, <https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting>
 * Released:  2019 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Marco Bertolini](https://github.com/bertolinimarco)
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately sixty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  In-world classism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aumyr

The website describes the project as follows.

 > Aumyr is a fantasy setting for role-playing games, born with the aim of being free, adaptable and ready to be played. It can accommodate many types of systems (d20™, Dungeons & Dragons®, Pathfinder®, Labyrinth Lord, etc...), provided they contain classic fantasy tropes as magic and wizards, elves, dragons, dwarves, warriors and so on. For a campaign set on Aumyr, use the basic rules for your favorite role-playing game. No value is provided typical of some systems such as Armor Class, Skill, Saving Throws, Difficulty Class or other mechanics, so that it is entirely entrusted to the narrator the ability to conduct the session independently.
 >
 > ### The world is yours
 >
 > In these pages you will find only some information about world history, deities and geography: it will be up to you to give life and color to everything else. Aumyr is designed to be used both by Masters who like to schedule their own game sessions, and for those who like to improvise and let themselves be guided by role-play. In the first case you will have several details on the setting, in the second it will be enough for the Master to take what he wants to start playing.

And it then goes on to detail more aspects of the world of Aumyr.

I should note that Bertolini wrote the book in Italian, which---like many languages---I haven't learned.  As such, I'll read this through machine translation, so the usual caveats apply that I may overlook clever turns of phrase or may not see connections that fit together in the original.  You can find a lot of the same material on the website translated to English and French, but because I want to follow a standard ordering---to know where to start and stop posts---and don't know how far the translations have progressed, I'll stick with the book.

## What Works Well?

The Ancient Ruins, subterranean cities left behind by the Askari, strike me as a clever and mostly plausible version of the typical (and nonsensical) fantasy-world dungeon.  You have the enclosed space, the possibility of finding valuable artifacts, and bizarre creatures, but they represent important (but unregulated) archaeological finds, rather than the result of unintelligent animals somehow hoarding things that people want.  And as massive unregulated archaeological sites, a story could treat them as mostly inexhaustible sources of adventures, since exploring and pillaging a post-collapse forgotten [Hefei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei)---to literally pick a random city---would look nothing like finding and defeating a "boss" monster to cart home its loot.

And while admittedly not a *huge* improvement over the last time, the organizations and describing the ancient ruins and multiverse as other regions provides a bit more variety in the descriptions.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Once again, we have some politically questionable choices, such as introducing Mercatus, a shadowy cabal of merchants and financiers allegedly responsible for a lot of strife by manipulating various groups.  In other words, the world of Aumyr has adapted something that looks uncomfortably like an anti-Semitic canard.

## Opportunities

If you visit [Aumyr's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting), you'll find what looks like the entire book in HTML sections, where you can file issues and suggest changes like any other repository.  They also offer an open invitation to join the [Aumyr Discord server](https://discord.gg/HP9bA4Z).

You can also check them out on a number of platforms, including the [Aumyr-it Deviant Art Gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/aumyr-it), though I note that none of the images carries an explicit public license.

## What's Adaptable?

Again, this section almost exclusively has elements designed for removal, starting with two regions with the same kinds of history and locations as we talked about last week, their version of the multiverse, the ancient ruins---listing quite a few of them in detail---and seven (so far) organizations or factions to populate a world.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up reading the background for **Aumyr**, from the *Guardia del Lupo* organization to the end.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the world?
