## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Starship Mine

To skip over some terminology bits, I haven't the foggiest idea where most of the names come from.  I considered that Arkaria might refer to [Marianne Curley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Curley)'s [*The Guardians of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardians_of_Time) series, but since she didn't publish the first book until this century, that seems unlikely.

Meanwhile, over on *DS9*, the crew needed to endure dangerous alien game night in *Move Along Home* and introduced us to Ferengi politics in *The Nagus*.

 > **PICARD**: All right, all right. Have Commander La Forge transport a stasis unit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it to store tissue samples.

Why does the astrophysics lab have stasis units?  Don't they work with things that generally don't age in the conventional sense?

 > **PICARD**: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really are interested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on Commander Hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master.

Does *Picard* not know how small talk works?

 > **PICARD**: Mister La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff. Mister Worf beat you to it.

As much as I get a laugh out of this, especially Worf's triumphant reaction, the writers *really* want to hammer this joke.  It'll come up again, too, all because Picard doesn't enjoy talking to the person...

 > **DATA**: It is very good to see you both again. Beverly. May I call you Beverly? Beverly, have you noticed that the mean temperature here on Arkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels? I have found that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty-one degrees Celsius in order to operate most efficiently. However, there are several cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature is identical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing. The Sheliak, for example.

Riker finally found a reason to care about Data:  Using him to mock somebody else.

 > **PICARD**: Horses?

That kind of excitement about horses probably gets you put on a list.

 > **DEVOR**: What are you doing?

You might recognize Devor as [Tim Russ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Russ), who'll soon land the role of Tuvok on **Voyager** for its run.

 > **KIROS**: This is Kiros.

When you actually see her, rather than the voice-over, you might recognize Kiros as [Pat Tallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Tallman), who has shown up on the periphery of the show---and will continue to do so in the franchise---for a while, both as a stunt double and background actor, but will soon take the role of Lyta Alexander on competing franchise **Babylon 5**.

 > **PICARD**: My name is Mot. I'm the barber.

We met Mot in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), I believe.

 > **RIKER**: I doubt if they'll agree to that. But maybe if we tell them Geordi's dying, they would give us access to a medical kit. We might be able to use some of the tools to make a weapon.
 >
 > **DATA**: Perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon. If the optical transducer were modified, we might be able to generate a hypersonic pulse.

I have to appreciate how quickly they jumped from "our friend needs medical attention" to "we can use our friend's plight to hurt people."

 > **RIKER**: Thank you. Now, the first thing I think we need to discuss is this.

Does he have *any* other approach than punching?

 > **PICARD**: I know they won't get very far.

Did I misinterpret this, or did Picard deliberately murder the crew of that ship?

## Conclusions

We might get less out of this episode than anything else.  It *tries* to say something about terrorism and capitalism, but never bothers to pay any of it off.

### The Bad

The crew openly hates gregarious people who can carry on a conversation, seemingly believing that all conversation directed towards them should have some relevance.  Repeatedly, every one of them points out that they don't want to go to the reception, don't want to talk to Hutch, and want to use Data as a buffer.

They also seem quick to resort to violence.  The resolution involves turning a valued colleague into a weapon, lashing out as a distraction, and setting a bomb on the get-away ship.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Picard assumes that the problems with office romances must apply to somebody else, in *Lessons*.
