* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113305914216207414) [Tax Cuts for the Rich Create Debt, Division, and Despair ‚Äî Not Jobs](https://otherwords.org/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-create-debt-division-and-despair-not-jobs/) from OtherWords

 > As wealth becomes increasingly concentrated, public trust in government erodes and social cohesion weakens. People may feel disenfranchised and alienated, perceiving that the system is rigged against them. This can lead to increased polarization and conflict.

Hashtags:  #Inequality #Politics

Note that quote in particular.  The article then goes into some of the research, but you'll notice that the same political movement that keeps insisting that their tax cuts for the wealthy will solve all problems also happen to consistently benefit from the resulting polarization and conflict.

 > These wood composites can be surprisingly strong ‚Äî stronger than steel by weight. But a mass timber element must be bulkier to achieve that same strength. As a building gets higher, the wooden supports must get thicker; at some point, they simply take up too much space.

I feel like this idea has circulated for a while, but I appreciate finally seeing it in action and working.

For long-time readers, note that she also had responsibility for the **Star Trek:  The Animated Series** adaptations by Alan Dean Foster that I read through for the [Real Life in *Star Trek*](/blog/tag/star-trek) posts.  And now that I see it, Judy-Lyn del Rey *might* account for the rogue *JLR* monogram that came up in the adaptation for [*Beyond the Farthest Star*]({% post_url 2021-08-19-farthest %}).

 > Slavery remains an immoral stain on the history of the United States and the collective history of humankind. We can never forget the horrors that were inflicted on our brothers and sisters through slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Nor can we forget the lingering effects this tragedy continues to have in our society.

When people further disseminate their material without consent, what should have been a controlled and respectful exchange quickly becomes a nightmare.

One imagine that this applies to everybody, but given the legal and social status of sex work, people find it far more convenient to avoid caring.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Humor and rock & roll against political harassment in Argentina](https://globalvoices.org/2024/10/09/humor-and-rock-roll-against-political-harassment-in-argentina/#) from Global Voices

 > As for her political side, from a very young age Lali has participated in numerous social awareness and justice campaigns alongside various foundations, NGOs and artists. She describes herself as a ‚Äúfeminist apprentice,‚Äù as she recognizes her own shortcomings and hypocrisies, and has set out to work on them to become an increasingly better feminist.

It always pleases me to realize that we live in a world where one side needs decades or centuries to impose their ideas on the world, whereas the other publishes art that often changes the world overnight.  And yet, the first side thinks of itself as strong and unstoppable...

 > The altered bacteria, tested on PET samples at 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), demonstrated a 400-fold increase in adhesion. This cohesive bacteria was united with an enzyme called polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase to break the material into smaller, more manageable fragments, resulting in what the researchers call a significant amount of degradation of the plastics overnight.

It seems interesting, but I should point out that I see stories like this frequently, and don't know of a single product that has resulted from this.  It may not work, then, on larger scales.
