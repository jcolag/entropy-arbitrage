* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Students‚Äô preliminary research is exploring why some Southern newspapers would cover lynching outside the state but not in their own backyards. Students are wondering if this was a form of erasure of local history.

Hashtags:  #Lynching #Journalism

I feel like I've seen prior work in this area, but people digitize so much media every year, that you can always find something new.

 > I was practically driven to Rome in order to obtain the opportunities for art-culture, and to find a social atmosphere where I was not constantly reminded of my color. The land of liberty had no room for a colored sculptor.

 > One of those, his push to end no-fault divorce, is enjoying a resurgence as a goal of the far right in its efforts to impose their misogynist agenda on the rest of the country.

Now that they openly advocate for domestic abuse, can we *please* stop treating them like a political party?

 > Posts were the most prevalent in California (132.7 per 10,000 posts) and least prevalent in West Virginia (1.4 per 10,000 posts). Democratic legislators were 31% more likely to post about 988 than were Republican legislators.

Honestly, I had completely forgotten about the Lifeline.  Granted, I've never needed it, but it still mortifies me to have overlooked something *so* small that could literally save lives.

I feel like the T2/Pebble team could have saved themselves a lot of trouble by *starting* with Mastodon or some other Fediverse server.  But they also all came up in a world built around exploiting users and exterminating the competition, not joining an unstructured movement.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://share.america.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/10-30-2023-Women-med-school-1068x559.jpg|The cover of the Thirteenth Annual Announcement of the New England Female Medical College in 1880, set against a photograph of women (mostly of dark skin) in a medical classroom|false|public domain presumed %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [As more women study medicine, look to where it all started](https://share.america.gov/as-more-women-study-medicine-look-where-it-started/) from the Bureau of Global Public Affairs

 > In 1864, the first Black female physician, Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler, graduated from [Boston Female Medical College] and began to practice in Boston, focusing on African-American communities that had been overlooked by the medical establishment. And in the 1870s, the merged schools admitted one of the first Native American medical students in the country, Ohiyesa, from the Santee Dakota tribe.

I stand impressed...except for the fact that we shouldn't *have* firsts like that, since we should never have barred classes of people from working in various fields.

 > This, as app developer Zhenyi Tan [wrote in an excellent blog this week](https://andadinosaur.com/youtube-s-anti-adblock-and-ublock-origin?ref=404media.co), has had the effect of confusing people, who have flooded Reddit, social media, and ad block review sites with differing information, because certain versions of certain ad blockers continue to work for some people, but not others.

 > The symptoms the Baker children had exhibited before death, though, were not those of diphtheria: the tight, stiff muscles of the face were characteristic of tetanus. All of the dead children had received antitoxins from a retired ambulance horse called Jim and, one month earlier, Jim had been diagnosed with tetanus.
