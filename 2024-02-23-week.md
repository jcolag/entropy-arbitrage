As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:07 -- Mon 19 February 2024

 > El Salvador stands as an example of how disillusionment can undermine democracy. President Nayib Bukele was reelected on Feb. 4, 2024, with what appears to be over 80% of the vote while overtly flaunting democratic norms.

Hashtags:  #Crime #Democracy #LatinAmerica #Populism

You might notice a familiar pattern, here, of one group making a mess of the economy, and then turning around to blame democratic values in order to acquire power.

Finally, we have someone besides me (a nobody, in terms of the media) talking about how corporate media has a distinct agenda of making its shareholders happy.

 > The campaign and the Institute for Policy Studies just co-published fact sheets for the nation and all 50 states on the interlocking problems that hit the poor hardest: poverty and inequality, systemic racism, ecological devastation, and militarism.

Hashtags:  #Voting #Inequality

Unfortunately, the article quietly neglects the fact that certain parts of the country *keep* the giant asleep through widespread voter suppression.  I appreciate the sentiment, but at some level, this still represents an assertion that politicians need to "excite" the electorate, instead of the electorate lighting a fire under every politician that doesn't excite them.

In all "fairness," if these studies didn't exist, then the judges would probably do what Alito did in [*Burwell v Hobby Lobby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.), blocking scientific evidence that Plan B medication didn't cause abortions, in order to allow the defendant corporation to have "strongly held religious beliefs" about the abortion that doesn't happen.

 > How pitiable is it to reflect, that although you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of Mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of these rights and privileges, which he hath conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren...which you professedly detested in others, with respect to yourselves.

This gets to the heart of what I meant (almost three years ago) in my post on [Doing the Work]({% post_url 2021-06-06-do-work %}), that whatever you call yourself based on beliefs, if you don't *act* on those beliefs, then those labels only do harm.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [For Female Journalists, Attacks Online and Offline Are Common Threat](https://www.voanews.com/a/for-female-journalists-attacks-online-and-offline-are-common-threat/7488809.html) from

I don't suppose that I could say anything that makes the point better than the headline itself.

{% embed https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2000/2024/02/hugo2.png|The Hugo Awards logo|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Leaked Emails Show Hugo Awards Self-Censoring to Appease China](https://www.404media.co/leaked-emails-show-hugo-awards-self-censoring-to-appease-china/) from 404 Media

 > The email replies to this directive show administrators combing through authors' social media presences and public travel histories, including from before they were nominated for the 2023 awards, and their writing and bodies of work beyond just what they were nominated for.

As you've probably noticed, I tend to ignore awards, and incidents like this make it abundantly clear why:  Even ignoring the absurdity of a panel holding some universal and consistent definition of quality, it leaves open plenty of room for bias and corruption.

## Follow Me

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
