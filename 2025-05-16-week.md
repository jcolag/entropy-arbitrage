As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > This was never a neutral project. Black people, cast as a permanent slave class, were never recognized as fully human but rather the vessels of both reproduction and the forms of forced labor necessary to build Empire.

Hashtags:  #Fascism #Transphobia #BLM #ReproductiveFreedom

This drifts off the topic, because I assume that you don't need me to explain the relevance of anything here, but I often regret that we've had so much "what if the Confederacy won the Civil War" fiction in the United States, but none of it (that I've seen, at any rate) shows us the corporatized breeding camps and labor camps that a modern Confederacy would undoubtedly have...and how that bears rather unfortunate similarities to our world's carceral state and the forced-birth movement.

 > The opening line sets the script: moral panic disguised as scientific concern. Calling mifepristone ‚Äúnot medicine‚Äù is a lie so brazen it dares you into silence.

Hashtags:  #ReproductiveFreedom

This infuriates me, because we saw the same attitude in the *Hobby Lobby* case, where Sam Alito somehow maneuvered the rest of the Supreme Court into ruling on the case as if Plan-B pills caused abortions, despite their not doing that at all.  (Not that health care should consider abortions optional health care anyway, since nobody has them recreationally, but it still felt galling for them to actively dismiss the facts to rule on some "principle" of the case.)

Yes, exactly, and it seems telling that the Trump administration wants to curtail the country's soft power, economic power, and confidence in institutions.

And...yes.  Like I keep hammering about how good dystopian novels don't "predict" so much as take what everybody could see happening (if they cared) and apply it to middle-class white folks, cyberpunk has warned about this since the beginning, taking direction from big franchises---*Aliens*, *Terminator*, and so forth---that all use the callousness and obsession with growth of corporate America as a driver for horror.

These feels like a perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with Silicon Valley.  When somebody uses their product to abuse people, they want their name out of the press.  When they turn around and try to *sell* a new feature almost indistinguishable from how people use their product to abuse people, then want the abuse forgotten.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Making Ignorance Sacred Again](https://buttondown.com/KeepingScOR/archive/making-ignorance-sacred-again-keeping-scor-7/) from Keeping ScOR

 > Trump and his henchpersons want to return men like Columbus to their pedestals for obvious reasons. If they can re-establish Columbus as an untarnished hero ‚Äì along with America‚Äôs slave-holding founders ‚Äì maybe that will stop all this bothersome talk about injustices done to oppressed groups, both past and present, and discredit any efforts at redress and repair. Only a ‚ÄúRadical Left Lunatic‚Äù would want to dwell on the racist, sexist, homophobic or economic abuses carried out by historical figures ‚Äì or by the current regime.

And remember, the United States only ever had Columbus---since the post brings him up---as a national hero in the first place, because European countries already claimed the explorers who *didn't* lie and commit mass murder.  He had a massive rehabilitation campaign on his behalf to clean up his image.  The title *nails* this aspect.

Mostly, though, I wanted to highlight it, because the piece echoes a bit of what I had on my mind when I wrote about [remixing education]({% post_url 2025-05-04-30m-free-education %}), though revolving far less around Free Culture.  If you enjoyed that, then you'll enjoy this piece, either as text or a [recording released the other day](https://play.prx.org/listen?ge=prx_153_ef4e4038-7d10-4d11-9559-44b51fcb8484&uf=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.sceneonradio.org%2FSceneOnRadio).

 > Of the 14 collared bears that died during that study, just one died of natural causes. Conflict with people caused six deaths, perhaps seven. Collisions with road vehicles or trains killed another six; one cause of death remains a mystery. The level of conflict in the Elk Valley is 10 times higher than the average for the province. It‚Äôs ‚Äúa death trap for young bears,‚Äù says Lamb.

[The Town That Went Feral](https://newrepublic.com/article/159662/libertarian-walks-into-bear-book-review-free-town-project) recently caught my attention, so this feels like an appropriate book-end for it...
