## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Eye Of The Beholder

Since last time around, over on **DS9**, Dax found somebody to mentor, while the rest of the crew scrambles to keep a new universe from wiping out ours, since we keep all our stuff here.

Anyway, an unfortunate amount of this episode gets dismissed as "only a dream."  But I'll take it relatively seriously, since we can probably take it for granted that a vision that Troi considers realistic at least roughly conforms to how events *would* play out.

Oh, also...

{% cw Portrayal and Discussion of Death by Suicide %}

The characters react poorly to the events of the episode, spreading some fantastically bad ideas.  Before we get into this, then, if you find yourself in that kind of distress, call your area's suicide and crisis lifeline.  In the United States and Canada, you can use <a href="tel:988" aria-label="Call 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline">{% emoji telephone receiver %} 988</a>.  Across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, you can also text to the [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/about-us/where-we-are/), though (sadly) different numbers in different countries.  For everybody else---including if you need more specific help than two options[^R72XcM], or want to keep a list in case somebody you know needs them in the future---you'll probably want to check Wikipedia's list of [suicide crisis lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) for your country.

[^R72XcM]:  For example, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in the United States, back in July, ended the pilot program with The Trevor Project for targeted help for callers representing gender and sexual minorities, though as I write this, a [bill wants to reinstate it](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/09/22/youth-lgbtq-suicide-hotline-bill-baldwin-murkowski/).  Checking the longer list turns up that the Trevor Lifeline still operates on <a href="tel:18664887386">1 (866) 488–7386</a>, plus chat and text options.  And lifelines with other varieties of specific help also exist, both in the United States and other countries.

If you can benefit from help, then please **get help**.  Don't try to go it alone.

 > **KWAN**: I know what I have to do.

I don't love that they named the alien-played-by-an-Asian-man "Kwan" (as in, a common Asian name) *and* killed him off before the credits.

 > **RIKER**: A few more seconds, I could've saved his life.

Could he?  I didn't get any sense that Riker had more in his tank than vague aphorisms, and Kwan didn't seem to care either way.

 > **RIKER**: Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster than expected. He was pleased that I'd noticed.

It seems especially galling, then, that Riker phoned it in on trying to save the guy's life instead of trying to connect with him...

 > **TROI**: I met with him about six weeks ago, during the crew evaluations. He was very positive. He was looking forward to being posted to the nacelle tube.

Apparently, they consider the crew evaluations---from [*Lower Decks*]({% post_url 2025-09-04-lower-decks %})---a pivotal event, with how they've started using that, and not the death of an allegedly valued colleague during that time, as their central time reference.  You'd think that they never had to do paperwork before.

 > **PICARD**: I would like the two of you to piece together a picture of his last few days.
 >
 > **TROI**: If he made any personal logs, it might be helpful to look through them.

...Yes?  I feel like the logs probably exist for *exactly* that purpose, in fact.

 > **PICARD**: The medical situation on Barson Two has worsened. Starfleet has given us permission to exceed warp speed limitations so as to get back on schedule.

Ah, their speed limit to preserve the fabric of space, from [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}), remains in effect...but only to tell us that it (again) doesn't matter nearly as much as the ship's schedule.

 > **DATA**: That being the case, I find it difficult to understand why someone would deliberately terminate their own existence.

Really?  Hasn't he risked his survival a number of times, most recently in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-21-time-s-arrow-2 %})?  Also, why would he not take this up with Worf, who actually dealt with this question as the main plot in [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %})?  For that matter, you'd think that, if he couldn't understand, he would have asked during that episode, when it impacted somebody close to him...though maybe he didn't see a problem, given that the admiral in [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}) called Klingons "the alien trash of the galaxy," suggesting that their lives matter less.

 > **DATA**: As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasingly difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. The probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. I came to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself down and start again.

OK, so if he has felt this urge, why does he have trouble imagining other people having it?

 > **DATA**: I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat the problems I was having with my systems as challenges to overcome, rather than obstacles to be avoided.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Great way of looking at it, Data. I wish Lieutenant Kwan had been able to look at his problems the same way.

Wow, way to judge someone going through clear distress and probably dealing with an invisible illness.  Don't get help, I guess, or take your medication.  "Look at it as a challenge," because the show where they regret not conducting a campaign of genocide told you so.  They don't acknowledge the compulsion that Riker and Worf saw, instead dismissing the issue as vague sadness and a disinterest in positive thinking.

Again, if you feel like your death would make anything better, please ask for help from people who know how to not make things worse...professionals, rather than the likes of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, here.

 > **CALLOWAY**: No, but he was very sensitive to other people's moods. He used to look at me and know exactly what I was feeling. I always loved that about him.
 >
 > **TROI**: Well, Napeans are partially empathic. He may have inherited some of his mother's abilities.

This reminds me a lot of [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}), when Troi says that she "can't do [her] job" without her psychic empathy, suggesting (as I pointed out) that she doesn't actually have much of the conventional sort of empathy that you or I might display.  For example, here, we have a grieving almost-widow clinging to the rapport that she had with the deceased and how much he cared about her, and Troi dismisses that as probably only a psychic tic.

To Calloway's credit, she doesn't knock the Counselor's teeth in.

 > **TROI**: I don't know how to describe it. I was suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic. And the sensations didn't seem to be coming from any person. They were just there, in the room.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Well then, whose emotions were they? I thought you said were alone.

I make fun of Riker a lot for not preparing for missions, but does he also do the large language-model thing of only paying attention to the words in what people say that don't make things complicated?

 > **CRUSHER**: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. The experience overwhelmed you the first time. I think you should wait until your levels return to normal.

Shockingly, they created the neurotransmitter in question back in [*Dark Page*]({% post_url 2025-07-10-dark-page %}), with almost the same conversation---mention, question, and identical explanation---except that Troi's mother somehow didn't know the word in that case.

 > **TROI**: I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like what happened in the nacelle tube.

Does memory *not* work that way for most people, where the events feel real, given the reality of the sources?

 > **RIKER**: Mister Worf.

Hey, check out Riker's creepy silk shirt with...simulated shoulder pads, I think.

 > **WORF**: Lieutenant Corell seems to be enjoying your company.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I'd like to think so.

Not that he'd bother to check...

 > **WORF**: I mean I would never want to come between you and someone you are involved with, or had ever been involved with.

I hate this "bro code" nonsense, but Michael Dorn does such a good job of this sputtering...

 > **TROI**: Worf?

We've seen it mentioned before, I think, at least off in the corners, but I should call out that the crate or toolbox or whatever that Troi sees in her vision makes clear that they built at least part of the *Enterprise* somewhere in the neighborhood of [Utopia Planitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia), the largest impact crater on Mars.  Notably, though they wouldn't have known this for the episode, in 2016, NASA detected ice under the crater, possibly around the size of Lake Superior.

Anyway, as mentioned a bunch of what follows officially happens in Troi's imagination, so we can't take it *too* seriously, though we can assume that her thinking of it as real implies that it at least withstands some scrutiny.

 > **DATA**: The shipyard where the *Enterprise* was built.

Also, where Kwan worked, which seems more directly relevant, no?

 > **PIERCE**: That's right. I was sorry to hear what happened.

If Pierce looks familiar, it probably has something to do with [Mark Rolston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rolston) playing him, known for everything from **Aliens** to **Turn:  Washington's Spies**, with a couple of appearances on **Enterprise** in between.

 > **WORF**: But you implied that...? We have played poker together many times. I've never known you to bluff.
 >
 > **TROI**: Well it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? The fact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least some telepathic ability.

I believe that the aforementioned *Ethics*, ironically, and then [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}), introduced the idea that half the floating senior officer card game probably uses their superhuman abilities to cheat at poker.

 > **TROI**: Maybe we should try to access the Engineering logs from Utopia Planitia. We might find out more about him.
 >
 > **WORF**: There may be something in them about Lieutenant Kwan as well.

They...didn't already think of this?  Set Data to downloading them and skimming, maybe?  That feels like something that any reasonable investigator would've requested as soon as they got the sense of a connection between now and then.

 > **WORF**: Yes.

Paying careful attention to consent?  On *this* show...?  I never thought that I'd see the day.

Seriously, though.  I suppose that we shouldn't take this too literally, since the scene takes place in Troi's fantasy-land.  But her imaginary version of Worf waits for enthusiastic responses, rather than "signs," half-hearted assent, or assumptions of interest.  And we can probably assume that Worf does this not *only* to protect Troi, but because only a complete oaf wants to have sex with anybody who doesn't feel as excited to participate.

 > **TROI**: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a long time ago?

Maybe it has something to do with how she seriously considers running off with any fascist who wanders too close to the ship and only treats Worf---since at least [*The Most Toys*]({% post_url 2023-09-28-most-toys %})---as a punching bag?

 > **TROI**: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there.

Ooh, somebody studied since [*Thine Own Self*]({% post_url 2025-09-11-thine-own-self %})...

 > **WORF**: I think it is time we had another conversation with Lieutenant Pierce. Ensign Calloway, thank you for your help.

Speaking of which, notice how they've forgotten about her connection to the deceased?  Rather than letting her grieve, they put her to work (or would) on looking after medical supplies and investigating her lover's suspicious death.

 > **LAFORGE**: Kind of like a psychic photograph.

Once again, I can't help read some New Age nonsense into this quick line, given the movement's earlier obsession with [Kirlian photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography) as supposedly capturing psychic phenomena.

 > **TROI**: That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind must have taken elements from my own life and then created a situation that in many ways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, I would have jumped just like he did.

I notice that they didn't include Riker in this conversation, conveniently preserving his interpretation that he tried his best to rescue Kwan, when it didn't take anything more to save Troi than tapping her on the shoulder...

 > **TROI**: Well, you know what they say, Mister Worf. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

From [*The Mourning Bride*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mourning_Bride) by William Congreve (1697), Act III, Scene 2, we get the *actual* line that "Heav'n has no Rage, like Love to Hatred turn'd, Nor Hell a Fury, like a Woman scorn'd."  The simplification and aberrant use of the word "hath" came from later assumptions that the line came from either Shakespeare or the Bible.

Incidentally, you also know the play for another line that you probably think comes from somewhere else, "Musick has Charms to soothe a savage Breast, To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak."

Does Troi know the actual source?  I'd guess not, given that she showed in *Dark Page* that she didn't have any understanding of **Paradise Lost**'s plot, despite the title providing a shockingly useful summary, not to mention the assorted times that Picard has spouted Shakespearean-sounding lines from other authors without comment.

## Conclusions

We continue to find out that they considered the crew evaluations highly traumatic, and seem to classify all events as happening before or after the evaluations.  Oh, and we also briefly see some civilian fashion, along with some William Congreve.

### The Good

We get some (vague) hints that at least some people understand consent in relationships.

### The Bad

They seem to think that suicide prevention happens by badgering the prospective victim into looking at somebody.  Even when they know the person well, they don't seem at all interested in connecting.  In fact, their model for suicide seems to sit somewhere between "vaguely sad" and "pathetically weak-willed," where people with depression should quietly commit to fixing their perspectives.  Comparing to other episodes, we also see a fairly strict hierarchy in whose lives they value.  And interestingly given the focus of the episode, the counselor doesn't go anywhere near these conversations.

Speaking of the counselor, she appears to go fairly far out of her way to tell somebody dealing with grief that her dead partner's empathy probably only came from reflex, not actual care.

Everybody also seems grossly ill-prepared to take on an investigation into a death, where they repeatedly ask each other if they should maybe look for clues in places where people might generally leave clues.  And the clues that they do think about, they don't seem to notice them for remotely relevant reasons.

The limit to warp travel still exists, but only to remind us that it doesn't actually matter in practice.

We have returned to Data asking questions that he actually has a better chance of answering than most.  Likewise, Riker doesn't bother listening to people, and asks "follow-up" questions already answered.

People see men as having some sort of ownership over women who they've dated, where one needs to ask their permission before attempting to start a new relationship.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next week, when the crew completely misunderstands furries, along with evolution and a bunch of other things, in *Genesis*.
