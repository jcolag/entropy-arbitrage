A while back, a reader reached out to me---almost always a good start to a story---partly catching up, because I know them from elsewhere, but also asking a question that took me off guard.

![A logo representing Free Culture, featuring a sketch of three definitely generic modular brick toys stacked as a corner](/blog/assets/117878252_3c00463c07_o.png "I considered an alternate logo for this post, but I still don't hate this so much...")

To wit.

> What's Free Culture?

And looking back on almost six years of this blog, almost two and a half million words, it looks like I somehow never touched on that.  This embarrasses me quite a bit, since I often try not to sink into jargon.  You'll notice how often I need to use a term in a post before I'll even use a common abbreviation.

I *have* talked about [the movement and its failings]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}) and [why I care so much]({% post_url 2023-06-25-free-culture %}) about the idea, not to mention spending every Saturday morning trying to strong-arm you into checking out some project via the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club), yes.  But it doesn't look like I've ever defined the idea or how I see it.

Let's fix that, starting this morning.

As a preview of things to come, my writing here started to grow out of control---I have had this in the hopper for over a month, now, I think---so instead of putting off the release and then asking people to try to absorb what might clock in at fifteen thousand words, all said, I want to split the discussion up over a series of posts[^n9qV8u].  I don't know that I'll release them consecutively, because other topics might come up that demand space on a Sunday, but the posts will come *relatively* close together.

[^n9qV8u]:  Also, a few people have apparently started thinking about these issues online, so it seemed like the right time to strike.

This week, we'll start with the bare minimum.

## Elevator Pitch

If you have some familiarity with the [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) movement, then you probably won't need much of this post, because Free Culture adapts their *four freedoms*[^vOPnQR], but for cultural works.

[^vOPnQR]:  I don't believe that anybody else has paraphrased the four freedoms exactly like this, but I think that it'll work out well for our purposes.

- The freedom to experience the work as you wish, without restriction
- The freedom to study the work, and to create derivative works that say what you want
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others without restriction

And by "cultural work," I mean any product that copyright might ordinarily govern, some creative work that somebody might want to copy, distribute, adapt, display, or perform.  Novels, short stories, films, poems, music, paintings, sculptures, video games, and so forth, all qualify.  And so do articles, photographs, documentaries, opinion pieces, and utility software.  If you have the legal capacity to exercise the four freedoms---enjoy, modify, copy, and distribute---then it qualifies as Free Culture.

I'll get to the reasons for this later, but I sometimes implicitly or explicitly distinguish between two varieties of Free Culture, one where the creator has affirmatively granted you those four freedoms, and one where you "ended up with them."  Works whose copyrights have expired, placing them into the public domain, fall into the latter category.

## Why Care Today

At least at this point in history, I believe that we have five different categories of media, and recent incidents might have shown the importance of these categories.

### The Big Guns

The material that we all know, we can probably best call **corporate slop**[^RL1Pq1].  Produced at the behest of corporate management for a broad audience, this media exists primarily to maintain and expand the company's share of the market.  Sometimes, for example, a studio or publisher rushes out a project to make sure that they can keep control over a trademark.

[^RL1Pq1]:  While the term "slop" has had something of a renaissance in describing the sort of trash spewed out by Large Language Models, but I've seen it used for a long time to describe the sort of inoffensive works, mimicry of art in a sense, crafted to make money rather than for an aesthetic purpose.  Jingles and theme songs have often served as the classic example, resembling artistic music and sometimes even enjoyable, *but* deliberately conveying little to no personality to avoid offending anybody and having a primary goal of selling a product.

If their work *happens* to resonate with the audience or win some critical acclaim, then they'll approve, but only because that gives them another edge over competitors.  Due to [media consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership), you can generally identify these organizations quickly, because a given medium often only has about five of them, sometimes one or two artificially inflated to pretend that they have a chance of competing, and ignoring shared investors and board members that might make them march in lock-step.

### Scrap-Beggars

Chasing the big guns churning out corporate slop, we have **upstart art** for lack of a clearer term, work by the corporations that fight---usually by claiming stronger principles than the major players in the market, such as a strong commitment to art or journalism---over the niche markets that the big companies don't care about.

These organizations might produce purely artistic or alienating work, but they also have dreams of becoming one of the big players in the industry, and so have no serious objection to producing corporate slop, since the fastest road from "disruptive media" to "monopolist" involves literally selling out to an existing part of the oligopoly, so that the new corporate overlord can put slop in front of that growing niche audience.

You see this most bluntly in film, where the overwhelming majority of "independent studios" don't actually have any independence, because a major studio completely owns and controls them.

### Knights-Errant

Parallel to the scrap-begging upstart art, we have **mission-driven** media, projects (and organizations) that exist for a dedicated purpose, such as their commitment to the craft, serving their niche, or political purposes.  This category definitely includes public and government-run media, but it might also include well-funded organizations churning out their particular brand of propaganda.

They don't operate like the major corporations or scrap-beggars, but they at least partly define the boundaries of the ecosystem by participating in it but resisting capture through adherence to the mission; usually, the corporate structure of these organizations centers their mission, making it difficult for another organization to control them without violating the organization's governance rules.

### DIY

Beyond those groups, we have **alternative** media, often standing apart from the rest of the ecosystem, and usually with no interest in joining it, beyond wishing that it had the same budget.

Often, this looks like a smaller version of the knights-errant, though using scrappy little teams struggling to release projects related by topic or theme.  And it usually targets the tiniest of niches through a strong perspective or even bias.

### The Point of This

Finally, off in the fringes, you see **Free Culture**, not only standing outside the primary ecosystem, but---in adhering to the aforementioned four freedoms---inviting you and guaranteeing your right to *participate*.

### Quick Analysis

You'll pardon the bluntness, I hope, but if you live in the United States like I do, you've spent most of this year (2025) seeing the difference between many of these categories of media, nearly every day.  We have seen plenty of corporate slop that happily takes your money and praise for having fictional characters stand up to imaginary fascists "over there" or opinion pieces that *finally* admit something that we all knew decades ago, while also complaining that you won't give them your money when they see corporate-enabled authoritarians pulling people off the streets, dismissing human rights, or even threats against their lives, and refer to it as legal jockeying or testing the system's limits.  The owners fall over themselves bowing to power[^V-1v9A] instead of speaking truth to it.

[^V-1v9A]:  Critically to the point earlier, they usually bend the knee---apologies for the mixed metaphor---to acquire permission for an expansion or merger, further consolidating the market.

The scrap-beggars have dutifully pointed out that this behavior will chill dissent, and then seem to have chilled their own dissent at a time when they could speak out.  The mission-driven groups have insisted that they haven't changed anything, even while their messaging revolves around the threats to their model, which presumably comes at the expense of other activities.  Alternative media beats its chest, similarly touting how nobody has cowed them, but also giving the strong impression that they'd like to start begging for scraps, now that so many other outlets have abandoned the communities that empowered them.

And Free Culture?  It plugs along telling personal stories and, again, trying to bring you into the movement, not as a passive consumer, but as either a part of their creation or the leader of some creation of your own, based on what you already have available or not.  And that stance makes them highly resistance to capture, even when they overtly or covertly make bold political statements.  Even if the media property became important enough for a large company to take an interest, a good license---more on licensing in future weeks---would force them to participate with the community as a peer rather than a centralized leader, and anybody who doesn't like their behavior can create an equally official version of the project.

Parallel to that, in social media, you have the big companies increasingly used as megaphones for billionaires, prioritizing slop.  Upstarts occasionally show up, as well as mission-driven groups, whether to get bought out or to serve a specific community.  Alternative sites abound.  And then you have the Fediverse, steadily growing in a way that defies capture.  Corporations can join the Fediverse, but they can't impose their policies, and if they behave poorly, they'll find themselves isolated on the network.

We should care today, in other words, because Free Culture defies consolidation, centralization, and oversight.  By its nature, it works against centralization and authority, and towards community[^etDNsv] and cooperation, even if we never actually meet the other members of that community.

[^etDNsv]:  That doesn't mean that all works or all creators *believe* in cooperation or opposing strict authority.  Far from it, in fact.  You'll find plenty of creators who firmly believe in a world where community and society doesn't or shouldn't exist.  We'll talk about some of this in future posts.  And yet, they share their work openly, granting full permission to that community to do with the work as they wish, even if they wish it to have different politics.

As the other categories of media look for excuses to "hit it big" by finding more consumers, Free Culture always looks for collaborators, people to enjoy expanding and improving the work, rather than passively absorbing it.

## Coming Soon

This first post gives you a quick definition of Free Culture and tries to provide some idea of what purpose it serves in the media landscape.  When we get to the second part of this, now that we have a grasp on the present, I want to look at the future---through the distant past---to try to pull together a cohesive philosophy indicating what Free Culture could quickly become.

See you then...
