{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ‚ÄúIn other words,‚Äù he asserted, ‚Äúas it becomes more universally known what Negroes contributed to America in the past, more must logically be said and taught concerning the future.‚Äù

We've probably all read plenty of histories of Black History Month, but another one never hurts...

 > ...it is a truth too well attested to you, to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings, who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been looked upon with an eye of contempt; and that we have long been considered rather as brutish than human, and scarcely capable of mental endowments.

This story encapsulates so many issues surrounding corporations and our refusal to decolonialize society, and feels like it shows us all the issues at once.

 > The question of who should benefit from automation is always urgent, and it's also always up for grabs. Automation can deepen and reinforce unfair arrangements, or it can upend them.

I like to tell the story about how my kindergarten teacher used to talk about the amazing world ahead of us, with computers and robots automating jobs, to free people up to do what made us happier.  Decades later, nothing has proven her wrong, except for the utter disinterest in finding a better way of feeding and housing people.

 > ...study indicates that the current generation of diversity training programs are effective at changing minds but less consistent at changing behavior.

Long-time readers, I hope, already know why these training programs don't work:  The problem doesn't come from the individual cops.  The problem arises in the institution of policing, built on the idea of protecting capital from people and protecting white status.  You can have the kindest, most engaged police officers possible, but when the mission descends from that of slave patrols, border patrols, and private security, then send them to everything from medical emergencies to people playing the radio "too loud," those kind officers will happily kill Black people who look like a possible inconvenience.

 > Does anybody know of a best-practice for multiple #fediverse accounts? I'm thinking about trying out #Bookwyrm, for example, but it seems weird to split up identity that way.

I've rarely gotten useful responses from asking for information on social media, but I guess we'll see how this goes.

If you haven't already seen it, [Bookwyrm](https://joinbookwyrm.com/) tracks reading and enables associated activities.  It seems interesting, especially as I continue reading novels, but I don't love the idea of adding *more* social media accounts.

That said, I may blindly take the step of signing up on a Bookwyrm server, and see how that goes.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Republicans are so, so thankful to Musk. Not just because he‚Äôs thrown the rules out the window and made Twitter a welcoming place for white supremacy, antisemitism, and calls to violence. But because he‚Äôs feeding these conspiracies to them, one goopy spoonful at a time.

All this money and time spent, because conservatives don't like that people disagree with their unsound policies and conspiracy theories...
