* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Tomorrow, despite my repeated pleas to ignore the most worthless national hero in global history[^8vBEsY], the United States will celebrate [Columbus Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day).  You probably already know my opinion on old Chris, but for those of you who don't, Columbus consistently committed acts so heinous that even the Spanish imperial crown---you know, the same people who funded the [Conquistadors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador) to take anything not nailed down and murder anybody getting in the way, and ran [Inquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) back home for almost four hundred years, *that* Spanish imperial crown---thought that he had gone too far, and threw him in prison for the remainder of his life.

[^8vBEsY]:  OK, sure, I suppose that a certain noisy minority in the United States has found somebody even more addled, bigoted, violent, and ignorant than Columbus to uphold, and he'll probably make a big speech about "bringing Columbus back like nobody has ever seen" or some incoherent nonsense, before rambling about how Democrats want to bring down the price of transgender by millions of percents or something, tomorrow...

Americans care about him so deeply, because...we didn't have anybody else left, when we wanted to start building a national mythology.  Other countries had already claimed all the explorers of the New World's coasts who *didn't* consistently make the worst possible decisions for decades as symbols of their greatness, and countries don't like to share symbols like that, leaving Christopher Columbus, the biggest loser, waiting for some playground team to pick him.  And so we teach precious little about him, instead relying on fictionalized hagiographies such as [**The Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Life_and_Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus)[^BxVozU], which fabricated the idea that everybody believed in a Flat Earth, until this Italian dingbat wandered from castle to castle looking to fund his expedition crossing the Atlantic Ocean to find a faster route to India in a few weeks, tops.  Stories like that needed to exist, because if you tell the story in any non-fiction capacity, then Columbus doesn't feel like anybody's role-model...

[^BxVozU]:  Yes, it seems extremely likely that Flat Earther's exist because of Washington Irving, the same author that brought us the Headless Horseman and Rip Van Winkle.  Somehow, I have common cause---in my dismissal of Columbus, if nothing else---with Flat Earthers.  The mind boggles that I actually found a use for horseshoe theory...

That doesn't even get to the tiny detail that at least a few [Europeans made it to the Americas long before Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland) and didn't even confuse it with *any* part of Asia.  It also skips Chris's crackpot turn as a [prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Prophecies) believing that his arrival in Venezuela would result in the Second Advent.

Anyway, this year, it occurred to me that I had some natural counter-programming for this more-fake-than-Hallmark holiday, and quietly sat on it for many years.  In 1745, [Alain-René Lesage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain-Ren%C3%A9_Lesage) published **The Adventures of Robert Chevalier, Call'd de Beauchene, Captain of a Privateer in New France**, in six parts.  Buried in book four of six, the narrative---almost inexplicably, without even a title to the story and no more introduction than a comment about not judging people before putting yourself in their position---turns to a hypothetical alternative history where explorers from the Americas had discovered Europe[^PkHY4L] in the late fifteenth century, rather than imperial Europe making its way across the Atlantic.

[^PkHY4L]:  If you cringed at my suggesting that anybody could "discover" Europe, but wouldn't have noticed if I talked about doing so to the Americas, consider yourself part of the problem...

When I stumbled on a reference to it, way back, I tracked down a copy and transcribed the text, dropping it in my now-old folder of notes.

Therefore, as some people think about and celebrate crossing the Atlantic tomorrow, and some alleged end to ignorance, let's look at how that incident could have played out on some other world, as told by a hypothetical adventuring European who (apparently) doesn't actually know anything about Native American cultures...

## The Discovery of America

If the people of this New World, preventing us in the art of navigation, had first come to make a discovery upon our coasts, what would they not have had to relate of France at their return home?  Having discovered an unknown land to the northeast, would they say, we resolved to land there in order to take possession of it in the name of the chief of our nation, and to make our gods be adored there?

Some fishers, whom we endeavored to seize upon to inform ourselves of the country, and of the people that inhabited it, having fled to a large neighboring habitation, these barbarians, instead of offering us tobacco and maize, or at least suffering us to hunt and take in water, rained upon us a storm of large round black stones, which struck us down without our seeing the hands that cast them at us.  There was nothing but smoke, lightning, and dreadful claps of thunder.  Those of our company whom we had set ashore, finding themselves struck, and not knowing against whom to defend themselves, regained our canoes and put off to sea.

Then several of these savages came from under their habitations, as the wild beasts come out from their dens when the night approaches.  They appeared to us to be entirely covered with skins of different colors, of an extraordinary figure, and dressed in such a manner that one would imagine it must be painful for them to move. They examined with attention our dead extended upon the shore, and instead of eating the new-killed flesh, they covered it under the Earth ignominiously, despising it more than the *Orignacs*, or the meanest beast of their forests.

The necessity of procuring water and provisions obliged us nevertheless to land at some days voyage from thence in a place which seemed uninhabited, and where notwithstanding this we were immediately surrounded by figures resembling the first, but less shy. We could only see their faces and their hands, the pale and livid color of which they have not sense enough to hide, by covering it with the different paintings which we know so well how to make use of.

We presented to them the *Calumet of Peace*, and some of our finest skins, after which they came up to us, speaking to us in an odd language, of which we could not comprehend a word.  We made them, however, comprehend by our signs, that we stood in need of water and provisions:  They brought us a kind of *sagamite* hard and baked, of which they ate themselves first, and which we thought tolerably good.  They drank also before us of a prepared water, whose color was suspicious to us.  They brought it in little round skins, which were hard, transparent, and very well wrought, but we dared not drink of it; and they were obliged to give us water, with which we filled our goatskins.

We remarked, during some days that we stayed to take provisions, that these savages had no gods, at least we did not see that they had any to whom they did homage.  They have nevertheless a superstitious veneration for grasshoppers, bats, and lizards; for they several times prevented us from eating of them, and seemed to look upon us with horror when we attempted it.  It is probable also, that they believe that after this life there is no other in the country of the dead; for when anyone dies in their cantons, though it is one of their chiefs, they neither give him maize, nor utensils, nor arms, nor even slaves to serve him in the other world.

We had compassion upon the blindness of these unhappy wretches.  We followed them one day into a place where they carried one of their dead singing before him, and which we imagined to be a temple.  Our piaces[^_y7Lpm] advertised us to carry with us our great god Huītzilōpōchtli whom they showed to them, exhorting them to acknowledge their error, and profit by the advantage they had of being able to cast their eyes upon the greatest of the gods, but far from prostrating themselves before him as our Piaces, and adoring him together with them, these impious wretches had the insolence to overthrow with a profane hand this dreadful god, to break his legs, and tear off his wings:  At this spectacle, seized with a just horror, the priests of Huītzilōpōchtli flew upon these infamous men to revenge our god by their death and the pillage of the temple.  But, less strong than courageous, our piaces were seized upon and closely bound; as to us, having hastily regained our canoes, we escaped from their furious hands:  But we had the chagrin before our departure, to see our terrible god devoured in the flames, in the view of our little fleet.

[^_y7Lpm]:  Priests[^Dg1hZg]

## Notes

I made some small changes, here, for readability.

- The spelling reflects modern American English, rather than the period translation.
- I corrected the presumed error that the Americans "discovered an unknown land to the North West" to reorient them to the northeast, since you'd have a rough time sailing from the Americas northwest to France.
- This splits the lengthy paragraphs that drifted from topic to topic.
- It no longer includes the extensive unnecessary Capitalization of random Nouns.
- I added the footnote to the footnote, to explain that I didn't create the first.

Otherwise, this comes entirely from Lesage.  Most of the material, I see no reason to explain more than the above, other than to shake my head at the complete ignorance on display, but I do want to note that he spelled the name of [Huītzilōpōchtli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%C4%ABtzil%C5%8Dp%C5%8Dchtli), the Nahua Sun and war deity, as *Vitzliputzli*, which may come from some authentic transliteration of the day or may not come from anywhere.  Best I can figure, the mention of "Orignacs" seems to refer to moose or deer, from cognates/borrowings French [orignaux](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/orignaux) and Basque [oreinak](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oreinak#Basque), though either coincidentally or as some inside joke, [Orignac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orignac) appeared on maps earlier than the novel, and the similarly named and not-too-far-away [Aurignac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurignac) would later provide evidence of the earliest settlements of modern humans in Europe, so I have no real idea what the author intended.

Similarly, to the point of Lesage and his characters not knowing anything about any Native American culture, [sagamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagamite) doesn't seem like something that you can make "hard"---though you could *maybe* stretch the idea to encompass early versions of cornbread---and also doesn't really fit with the implied premise[^MZGK8I] of Tenochca sailors crossing the Atlantic.  Oh, and nobody in the Western Hemisphere would have referred to their pipes as [calumets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_pipe), a French term, nor do they appear to have spread south to anywhere near the relevant territory.

[^MZGK8I]:  Referring to the divine patron of an empire's capital (Tenochtitlan, in this case), along with placing France north of the starting point, and that the Spanish invaded Mexico long before the French began poking around the north, it all makes it difficult to assume that the author meant the expedition to launch from anywhere but the Triple Alliance.  Also, the first leg of such a journey would most likely take the sailors between (modern) Florida and Cuba, and through the Bahamas, the eastmost of which includes Guanahaní, where Columbus would have landed 533 years ago today, which feels appropriately symmetric.  If not for all that, we might assume that the author imagined these particular sailors to have started their journey in the United States Midwest, coming down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico[^OzhcVp], which would feel more consistent with the other elements of the fictionalized culture...but even then, not quite.  Moose live too far north, for example, for even the Illinois Confederation---who lived along the Mississippi, made sagamite, and used ceremonial pipes---to see them as common dangers.  And why do I need to do this much research for a thousand-word story that somebody *else* wrote?

[^OzhcVp]:  No.  Nope.  Don't even bring it up, smart ass.

The placeholder title, *The Discovery of America*, I chose due to the ambiguity, here meaning a discovery attributed to people representing the Western Hemisphere, rather than claims to have discovered the continents.

**Credits**: The header image is [Native Americans](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/66590/early-facsimile-first-image-of-native-americans-dise-fig-froschauer) by Johann Froschauer, in the public domain due to an expired copyright, assuming that it ever had one.  In the spirit of disclosure, despite the extremely likely cultural insensitivity, I chose the image for three reasons.  First, the age of the work comes fairly close to the setting of the story.  Second, the perspective of their "water house" (boat), especially with the more Western sailing ships in the background, suggests a sailing vessel on the high seas.  Finally, I *think* that we can potentially justify the pervasive headdresses as equivalent to a naval tradition.  That doesn't make it any less insensitive as an original work of art not meant for this purpose, though, so I do apologize for any offense.
