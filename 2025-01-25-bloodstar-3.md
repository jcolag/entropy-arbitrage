This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**, from *A New Safe Haven* to *Wisps of the Fallen Star*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Blood of the Ancient Star**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov/bloodstar>
 * Released:  2021
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  [Kerkenov](https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov)
 * Medium:  Novella
 * Length:  Approximately thirty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Curses, vomiting, compound fractures, blood, death, and graphic animal sacrifice.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Blood of the Ancient Star

Sadly, I can't find any more information on the project than this.

 > It's an open source novel you can contribute to.

I can't even find the full name of the author, only a Microsoft Word file and the MIT license.

## What Works Well?

The sequence of Chloe excitedly experimenting with her new abilities, ironically, feels like one of the few grounded and emotional moments of the story.  Likewise, the final battle *almost* feels like it has a sense of action and place, as opposed to the muddy action sequences that we often see in modern media.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

This section starts off feeling like it lost a lot of material, somewhere.  The story tells us that the Sun-cult builds a walled city in about a week, which seems unlikely but acceptable.  Then, in the middle of a conversation about potential military threats, the city exiles our protagonists without any explanation.  And then, while on the run, they get into a fight, with one of them planning to return to the city.  Maybe I didn't focus properly, but I have no idea *why* any of that happened.

Similarly, a surprising number of characters seem to become disposable, killing them without much reason or effect.  And the ending seems odd, given that I believe that we already know what happened in Ancient Greece.

## Opportunities

The book has a repository on Codeberg, but nobody has touched that repository in three years, and the author doesn't have any other projects that might indicate whether they might have an interest in the solicited contributions.

## What's Adaptable?

This section introduces Sun City, the undersea humans, and the shape-shifting shark-like Rusties.  The empowered version of Chloe, propagating her abilities, also seems distinctive.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll watch **The Man Behind the Machine**, a short film.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
