As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Fear is all the more visceral because we‚Äôve already seen many people‚Äôs lives disrupted. Like a coal plant, this administration fills the air with a dangerous smog of fear that we are all inhaling.

Hashtags:  #Protest #Solidarity

I'll remind everybody that Trump himself described his tactics as "shock an awe," a military approach where a force bombards an enemy to demoralize their resistance.  People love to suggest that they aim for cruelty, but they actually aim for consuming fear that silences us.

I assume that they'll find some other way of wrecking it, but I assume that most readers here know that I have a lot of respect for Voice of America, an organization that has---through many administrations and political swings---deliberately served as a model of how the free press benefits everybody.

 > With broad public support  for strengthening Social Security, embracing immigration is not just beneficial ‚Äî it is essential to ensuring the program‚Äôs long-term stability and success.

Hashtags:  #Immigration

I actually *hate* the shift of attention away from the humanity and personal value of immigrants---that we care about them as people, I mean, who want to improve the countries that they move to---in favor of talking about their economic benefits, especially when the argument goes to social safety nets that the anti-immigration people also want to destroy, but if it takes that to get people to pay attention, I guess we need to deal with it.

 > Enslaved people‚Äôs experiences of disability were a subject of debate among pro- and anti-slavery thinkers and campaigners, who were mostly white or light-skinned, which further stigmatized and oppressed Black people.

We've kicked this idea around before, so it probably won't come as a shock to any long-time readers.

This colonial aspect of anti-queer law seems especially relevant as we see so many right-wing Catholics salivating over the idea of the church electing an African Pope.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I don't need to explain anything about this, right...?  The right-wing loves the idea of "government like a corporation," where executives walk in lock-step to impose their wills through the employees/citizens.
