As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > And so the project has tried to map a lot of different voices and trying to bring up examples like, here are people who are doing liberation work, but also thinking about how do we feed people? How do we love up on people when they‚Äôve experienced grief, loss, and violence?

I have a feeling that we'll need to spend a lot of time re-learning what the Black Panthers put together in the coming years...

 > If a man says that it is right to give every one his due, and therefore thinks within his own mind that injury is due from a just man to his enemies but kindness to his friends, he was not wise who said so, for he spoke not the truth, for in no case has it appeared to be just to injure anyone.

Keep in mind that a bunch of Republicans tried to block releasing this report and wanted him helping to run the executive branch of the government.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113748529719116160)

 > The object of a New Year is not that we should have a new year. It is that we should have a new soul and a new nose; new feet, a new backbone, new ears, and new eyes. Unless a particular man made New Year resolutions, he would make no resolutions. Unless a man starts afresh about things, he will certainly do nothing effective.

Have something to watch in case 2024 didn't feel stressful enough, I guess.

I don't love their framing of these situations as largely solved because they got involved, but it still makes a decent roadmap of how these issues will play out.

 > This remarkable decline is attributed to improved vaccines, higher vaccination rates, and the vaccine‚Äôs long-term effects. These findings suggest that women are now largely protected against cervical cancer.

Hashtags:  #GenderEquality #Health

Between the awful messaging with rolling out the vaccine, the lack of interest that medicine generally takes in women's health, anti-vaccine sentiment, and more, I never would have guessed that we'd have results this good.  And we got these results in less than twenty years.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100](https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-dies-at-100/7917788.html) from Voice of America

 > As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

Carter couldn't live forever, but it still hurts to have him die.  By the way, the articles and other retrospectives don't seem to want to remember that Carter not only inherited most of the problems that Republicans blame him for, but also got next to no support from Congressional Democrats, both because he believed in a strict separation of powers and because Tip O'Neill and Ted Kennedy both had weird grudges against him.  And yet, he managed to turn down the heat on a bunch of international conflicts, push through critical policies, and solve a lot of the problems that he inherited, only for a vapid, incoherent Republican to campaign on racism and "economy vibes" and sweep the country.

Thank goodness that we'll never have that problem again.  Wait, what?  That almost exactly describes what happened over the last four years?  The heck you say...
