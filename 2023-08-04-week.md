As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## "Programming" Note

For people reading this when it comes out, I'll hold my first, highly experimental "office hours" tomorrow---Saturday, August 5<sup>th</sup>---where you have a decent chance to track me down for whatever conversations people seem interested in.  From what looks like 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM GMT, you can either...

 * Drop in on the [`#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org) chat-room on [Matrix]({% post_url 2020-03-28-riot %}) and start talking, or
 * Ask me a question [on Cohost](https://cohost.org/jcolag).

I picked Matrix, because they created it as Free Software on a federated, open protocol, which fits well with many of the blog's goals.  I picked Cohost, because it has the "Ask" feature, which *might* draw out some readers who might otherwise not want to dive into a chat system.

Both will have the best moderation that I can muster.  Will we look back on this as a success?  You'll only know if you participate.

 > Empowering youth to recognize and draw strength from the cultural wealth of their ethnic/racial background is critical for their well-being, especially during mid-adolescence when they are forming their sense of self by exploring who they want to be, what they value and what their goals are.

I admittedly find studies like this a *bit* hard to take.  While I want teenagers to thrive, family stories about "the old country"---that none of the living relatives had visited, let alone lived in, by the way---always came off as pointless and mildly embarrassing.  But then, I also didn't grow up with people asking if I belonged in this country.

I don't have much to offer, here, except wishing the area luck.  I don't envision myself traveling to Asia, but if I happen to do so, Dal Lake looks like a great stop.

 > It seems weird to defend those traitors until you realize that embracing Confederate flags and defending slavery are now a feature, not a bug, of the modern conservative movement.

Hashtags:  #USPol #GOP #Confederacy

Much like how they fought the infrastructure bills but want credit for their passage on the campaign trail, Republicans also agreed that we shouldn't name bases after traitors and passed *that* bill, only to insist that the real heroes fought to destroy this country for the right to own people and breed them like cattle.

 > Having given up on manually assembling training data based on careful human judgment with multiple review steps, the AI industry "pivoted" to mass ingestion of scraped data from the whole internet.

Hashtags:  #AI #Oppression

I had a professor in college who would quietly talk about how a consulting gig had mostly radicalized them, though nobody used the term at that time.  Someone called them in, back before people would have done this on computers, to build a predictive-policing model.  After studying the data, they determined that---you guessed it---no statistical analysis existed that could turn arrest records and convictions into crime predictions, except inside the already-policed.  The prediction could *only ever* say to continue current policies.

They thanked this person, sent them on their way, and then hired the statisticians to do exactly that.

I emphasize the story, because Doctorow unfortunately downplays how authoritarians don't always want accurate information from their models.  They often want a chart that tells them to "stay the course."

I've almost certainly gone through this analysis before, but this once again shows us that (a) people become poor when they don't have enough money, (b) giving poor people money takes them out of poverty, and (c) attaching conditions and tracking to that money, rather than keeping it out of the hands of not-poor people, instead fails to lift people out of poverty.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Corporations‚Äô loyalties tend to lie with profits and shareholders, and the political principles that companies embrace may get quickly discarded when profits are threatened.

I feel like I've talked a lot about this, recently, though maybe not on the blog.  Recent politics has left me in an uncomfortable position, because we now see progressives cheering a monopolistic company trying to push back against corporate oversight.  And while I feel happy watching Disney and DeSantis hurt each other, whoever survives this will present a greater threat to all of us, later.
