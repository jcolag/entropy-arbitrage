As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 16 June 2025

Once again, I couldn't get my act together for Monday posts.  I apologize.

 > What you‚Äôre doing is sanctioning the death of transgender people, whether they are transgender or otherwise, they are still human beings, and we should not be subjecting them to death because they do not conform to what our ideology of human beings should be.

Hashtags:  #Trump #Incarceration #LGBT

I assume that we already all knew this, and that the Trump administration especially knows it, but we need to point it out more often so that *other* people know it.

 > Other researchers have found that health systems participating in the Healthcare Equality Index have lower rates of nurse burnout and better quality of care, along with higher patient satisfaction among all patients.

Note the section that I quoted, especially.  This doesn't "not apply to you."  If your facility cares about sexual and gender minorities, then *you* get better care, too, so you want to support providers who do the right thing.

 > Anecdotal evidence suggests that some activists are intentionally demonstrating in their local town rather than just traveling to a nearby big city for events. One participant suggested they may do so because it attracts neighbors who are new to protest.

While I don't like the circumstances leading to it, it does feel gratifying to see people actually fighting for democracy in the United States, after decades of insisting that somebody else should do that.

 > Child labor puts an additional strain on local health care, education, and social services when kids who are injured or fail to keep up at school. It also harms the labor market by depressing wages ‚Äî and puts businesses that actually abide by labor laws or ethical standards at a competitive disadvantage.

Hashtags:  #ChildLabor

I feel like I keep pointing out that fights for social progress never end, and this feels like a perfect example, something that we completely outlawed, but we didn't go far enough to completely eliminate the practice *and* we have creeps constantly waiting for opportunities to undo that progress.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://knowablemagazine.org/docserver/fulltext/hiv-drug-look-back-1600x600.jpg|Conceptual collage shows HIV virus, infected person, images of pills and microscope|false|by Knowable Magazine, presumably available under a CC BY-ND license %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [HIV medications: Did fears about side effects come to pass?](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2025/hiv-drugs-early-fears-about-side-effects) from Knowable Magazine

 > One encouraging report from a large clinical trial known as REPRIEVE, involving more than 7,500 participants, was that taking a statin medication [reduced rates of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiac problems among people with HIV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37486775/) by 35 percent. The five-year trial‚Äôs findings, published in 2023, have been [incorporated into clinical guidelines](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/statin-therapy-people-hiv) for treating people with HIV.

Upshot, if you don't have time to read the entire thing or go down the rabbit-hole to the underlying study, some minor side effects might arise in a small subset of patients, *but* the slim possibility of high blood pressure or osteoporosis doesn't really overshadow withering away with a damaged immune system.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Return the gods](https://africasacountry.com/2025/06/return-the-gods/) from Africa Is a Country

 > In classrooms today, children can name the gods of Mount Olympus, but even African children struggle to name the Orisas, Yoruba sky worlds, or Igbo covenant trees. This is no accident: Africa‚Äôs mythologies and their oral legacies have been largely dismissed.

Even as a public school-educated white guy, I really enjoyed the quick lessons on Ancient Greek mythology and the bits of Norse mythology that they presented as somehow "exotic."  And I assure you, I would've gone wild had they continued to the rest of the ancient world, feeling mystified that they didn't, other than as a legacy of dismissing the world beyond Europe.
