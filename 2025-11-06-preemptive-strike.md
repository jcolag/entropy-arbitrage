## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Preemptive Strike

Since last time, the **Deep Space Nine** crew would have continued the story from [*Mirror, Mirror*]({% post_url 2020-09-03-mirror %}) in *Crossover*.

And maybe for the first time in the parallel run of the two shows, this episode might actually have the bigger impact, though it similarly carries on a longer arc.  Critically, it follows the story from the former Federation citizens now living under Cardassian governance starting in [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}), which then wove through **DS9**'s two-parter *The Maquis*, the second part of which would have ended about two weeks ago when this aired.  Presumably, this also shores up the Maquis story in general, so that **Voyager** can...pretty much ignore everything that we have learned about their world.

Anyway, I don't get to say this much, but I have looked forward to rewatching this episode for a while.  It largely gives Ro Laren her own episode[^sT5QKz], even separating Michelle Forbes from the cast so that the gulf between her screen presence and theirs doesn't seem as embarrassing for the cast as it usually does when she shows up to play...

[^sT5QKz]:  I don't like to think about, let alone speculate about, behind-the-scenes in these posts, but since everybody probably knows that the studio wanted Forbes to star in **DS9** in the role that became Major Kira, and she turned that down for a mildly successful film career, I now wonder if somebody hoped that this episode would convince her to join **Voyager**.  It certainly would have helped the Maquis appearances then look less like cardboard, if they had spun out of this group with Ro having some clout, plus it all has the feel of a back-door pilot...

 > **TROI**: Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant.

It seems somewhat telling that Ro needed to transfer somewhere else to get a promotion...

 > **PICARD**: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention.

Two things, here, since Picard brings it up.  Actually, it probably only rates as one thing, since both seem inter-related:  Have we ever seen *any* character treated with this level of respect and affection on this show?  I initially broke this into the size of the party *and* Picard, really for the first time that I can remember, doing something kind for somebody, but those do seem like the same issue.

I don't disagree with it.  You all know that I adore the character.  But also, they don't like *anybody* this much, so something feels off.

 > **PICARD**: Ensign Gates.

That seems weird, right?  Do captains routinely oust random workers?  Where does Gates *go* for the rest of her shift...?

 > **PICARD**: You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation of our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack.

Actually, as I recall *Journey's End*, they needed to take up Cardassian citizenship to stay in their homes.  But also, even if that deal only applied to the neo-Zuni for some reason, what right does Picard have to boss around a bunch of civilians?  I could understand him saying that he has the authority and duty to protect the Cardassian ship no matter the attacker, but the idea that their citizenship makes them beholden to him seems worrying.

 > **RIKER**: I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect a Cardassian ship.

Note the disgust in his voice, creeping in during the *second* part.  But also, note "our own people," in that he objects more to firing on *humans* than he does on civilians in general.

 > **EVEK**: Do you people have experience treating Cardassians?

You presumably remember Evek from *Journey's End*.

 > **PICARD**: I can assure you that is not the case. We're doing everything in our power to control them.

Ah, yes, you can always tell the white-hats by how much effort they put into "controlling" civilians.

 > **EVEK**: The fact that my ship was attacked suggests that your efforts have met with limited success. They came at us with photon torpedoes and type eight phasers. Tell me, Captain, how do you suppose that a group of civilians acquired such weaponry?
 >
 > **PICARD**: I can assure you it was not through official channels.

The Federation, after all, can do no wrong.  They have grown past violence and the need for power over others...all evidence to the contrary.

 > **PICARD**: Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in the Demilitarized Zone any more than your government would condone the paramilitary actions of Cardassian civilians.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than a week ago, I would say that your efforts are meeting with limited success.

Wait.  Have Cardassians living in Federation territory taken up arms or haven't they?  Picard's first line implies that they see such activities as purely hypothetical, but then he cites a specific example.

That also ignores him equating an attack on a civilian freighter with an attack on a war ship.

 > **NECHAYEV**: Believe me, Captain, if I were living that close to the Cardassians, I'd keep a phaser under my pillow too. But in the last weeks we've seen signs that the Maquis are moving beyond self-defense. Their ranks are growing. They're acquiring ships, weapons. They seem to be preparing for a more aggressive military posture. We've got to put a stop to them before the entire Demilitarized Zone ignites. But before we stop them, we have to find them. They seem to be scattered in small cells around the Zone. And we don't have reliable intelligence about any of them.

Likewise, we last saw Nechayev in *Journey's End*.

However, I quote this line, because you'll notice how she sees the Maquis differently from Picard.  Rather than civilians that he needs to control, she understands it as a paramilitary movement looking for territorial sovereignty and possible expansion, both of which would put the Federation in potential danger.

 > **RO**: I've heard a lot about the Maquis. One of my instructors at Tactical Training, a Lieutenant Commander in Starfleet, a man I admired and respected, he was sympathetic to them. He resigned and left to join them.

It says a lot about the Federation that Starfleet officers have begun defecting to planets in Cardassian space.

 > **WORF**: If we learn that she has been here, this establishment will be closed down.

I feel a headache coming on with this political dynamic.  Starfleet officers can shut down a civilian bar outside their borders?

 > **RO**: Starfleet thinks I did. That's reason enough to hide. Why did you tell them that I'd left?

If we can assume that Ro doesn't exaggerate into absurdity here, which I assume that we can, then it doesn't say much about Starfleet's handling of crimes if officers would rather go into hiding than defend themselves against false charges.

 > **SANTOS**: There are worse things a person can do than kill a Cardassian soldier.

It didn't take long for "Federation citizens" to go from evolved beyond violence to not minding if somebody takes the lives of a bunch of Cardassians.  Or perhaps they haven't grown out of violence, like I've said all through the series.

Also, Santos may look familiar, as portrayed by [William Thomas, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomas_Jr.), who at the time people knew from his recurring role in the final season of **The Cosby Show**, but also had a much broader career that doesn't require us to deal with Bill Cosby at all...including **Cop Rock**.

 > **KALITA**: Did you kill that Cardassian soldier?

Because we'll see her a couple more times before we wrap up this project, [Shannon Cochran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Cochran) plays Kalita, and also shows up often enough that you might recognize her.

 > **RO**: There are rumors that the Cardassians are supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons.

OK, this has nothing to do with the post as such, and I have to admit that I love the look of the scene, *but* I also find it incredibly funny that Picard called Ro into the meeting area to walk laps around the conference table.

 > **RO**: Well, if I do, sir, it will not stop me from carrying out my duty.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I knew that I could count on you.

Well, that turned creepy quickly.

By the way, a deleted scene pushes this scene a bit further, with Picard admitting that he expects the Maquis to quietly surrender to his superior muscle, but might also wipe them out if they resist.

 > **PICARD**: But there are only six ships. We could even cut back that number.

Yes, they'll never notice that the convoy magically tailored itself to their requirements shortly after they declined to bother with it.  Yes, it doesn't matter because Ro lied to him here, but *he* doesn't know that.

 > **PICARD**: This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you back out now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We're committed to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carry out your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for having lied to me about this operation. I would certainly have you court-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision.

For the record, Picard threatened to destroy her career for potentially ending a mission unsuccessfully because she considers the orders immoral.  And he does this now that manipulating her has stopped paying dividends.

 > **PICARD**: I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothing happens to obstruct this mission.

This reads like another threat, no?  On top of scuttling her career and having her sent back to prison, he'll *also* send his enforcer along as "insurance."

 > **RIKER**: She seemed very sure that she was making the right choice. I think her only real regret was that she let you down. Here's my report.

Fair enough.  Picard doesn't seem to care about anything but the perceived personal betrayal, either, maybe appropriate since the aforementioned *The Maquis* had/will have an entire speech to that effect, suggesting that maybe Starfleet leadership has that sort of problem in that department.

## Conclusions

We either get a lot out of this episode or not much, depending on how you look at it...

### The Bad

We see a certain amount of racism, from Ro's apparent need to leave the *Enterprise* to receive a promotion, to Riker's concerns about firing on human-crewed ships to save non-humans, to the general interest among civilians in killing Cardassians.

We also get a strong sense that Starfleet controls the civilian government, rather than the other way around, with Picard asserting that he has authority over Federation citizens.  He also refers to "controlling" civilian populations; similarly, Riker claims that he can shut down a bar beyond Federation space.

Even as evidence accumulates that (former?) Federation citizens in Cardassian territory have taken up arms provided by sympathizers in Starfleet, they completely dismiss the possibility that any Starfleet officer might have provided aid.  They also, more strangely, seem confused as to whether the (former?) Cardassian citizens in Federation space have acted in similar ways, and struggle to equate any such violence from the Cardassian side.

And speaking of sympathizers, we find that Starfleet has begun losing officers to the Maquis, even those stationed on more distant planets such as Earth.

Starfleet, at least, doesn't appear to have a reputation for fair investigations and trials of suspected crimes.

As we've seen before, at least among Picard's crowd, they prize personal loyalty above everything else.  When people question the usefulness of that loyalty, the methods shift from manipulation to outright threats of deliberately destroying careers.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we start dismantling the show in *All Good Things...*, part one.
