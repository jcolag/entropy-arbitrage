## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## First Contact

Since the last post, **Deep Space Nine** finished a full two season---finishing the third and starting the fifth---while **Voyager** launched and has gotten a bit further than a third of the way through its third season, which will come up a couple of times in the post.

Given the two big directions of the plot---the history lesson and Picard's personal obsession---I don't expect to get too much out of this, but you never know...

 > **PICARD**: I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile.

Spoiler:  Resisting Borg plots also quickly becomes futile among the writers, sadly.

 > **PICARD**: Authorization Picard four seven alpha tango. Admiral?

An actual password?  Not a good one, mind you, at only four alphanumeric characters, but still...

 > Captains log, stardate 50893.5. The moment I have dreaded for nearly six years has finally arrived. The Borg, our most lethal enemy have begun an invasion of the Federation, and this time there may be no stopping them.

Something feels a bit creepy about the fact that, after destroying their ship, Starfleet immediately and unceremoniously assigned them all a new one, renamed the *Enterprise*, as if everybody assumes that the name belongs to them.

Contrast this with the end of [**The Voyage Home**]({% post_url 2022-04-07-tvh %}), where the bridge crew rightly worries that their transgressions will land them a lousy assignment that ends their careers, building to the reveal of the *Enterprise-A*.  This crew, though?  What else would Starfleet do with a bunch of self-entitled rich kids but give them whatever makes them most comfortable...?

Less important, but as we reveal those rich kids, La Forge has the futuristic eyeballs from [*All Good Things...*]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}), because the utopian future apparently can't have a Black man wandering around without something to distract from his face.

 > **RIKER**: What do you mean, 'We're not going'?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Our orders are to patrol the Neutral Zone, in case the Romulans decide to take advantage of the situation.
 >
 > **TROI**: The Romulans?
 >
 > **DATA**: Captain, there has been no unusual activity along the Romulan border for nine months. It seems highly unlikely they would choose this moment to start a conflict.

I like how they manage to play both sides of this, both that everybody still has that bizarre anti-Romulan paranoia---reminding us that they probably pose a threat in general, but not a this particular moment---*and* that they crave violence to such a degree that they dismiss any value in this bogus mission because it takes them away from shooting people.

 > **RIKER**: Bizet?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Berlioz. What do you have?

Specifically, we have *Song of Hylas* from [**Les Troyens**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Troyens), Act V.  [Bizet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Bizet) strikes me as more mainstream and less challenging[^I5mYAd], to modern ears.

[^I5mYAd]:  Not that opera composers have generally tried to create challenging art.  Today, we see the field as almost elitist and somewhat opaque, but for a long time, people considered opera entertainment for the masses.  For example, when we talked about [*A Matter of Time*]({% post_url 2024-07-11-matter-time %}), I mentioned that, when Verdi kept [*La donna è mobile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_donna_%C3%A8_mobile) from **Rigoletto** secret even from the cast, after the premiere, the song spread like wildfire through Venice, with fans performing it in the streets for weeks, and then it spread to the gondoliers and became the tradition that we still recognize today, and you've probably heard the song played in at least half the Italian restaurants and pizzerias (outside Italy, I imagine) that you might have visited, getting close to two hundred years later.  Opera commanded *that* kind of audience, hardly the white-gloved/black-tie crowds that we might imagine attending today.  Think more in terms of **K-Pop Demon Hunters** than a debutante ball.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, fascinating. Twenty particles of space dust per cubic meter, fifty-two ultraviolet radiation spikes, and a class two comet. Well, this is certainly worthy of our attention.

As they say, "there are no small roles, only small actors."  And they say it for exactly this sort of self-important whining about feeling too good for a particular job.

 > **FLEET COMMUNICATIONS**: Flagship to *Endeavor*. Standby to engage at grid A-fifteen. *Defiant* and *Bozeman*, fall back to mobile position one. Acknowledge. We have it in visual range. A Borg cube on course zero point two one five, speed warp point nine six.

The *Endeavor* wandered around the background of [*The Game*]({% post_url 2024-06-20-game %}) and presumably takes its name from [the space shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour) that flew from 1992 until 2011, and the *Bozeman* got a mention in [**Generations**]({% post_url 2025-12-04-star-trek-generations-1 %}), where I walked through that.  The *Defiant* spends most of its time over on **Deep Space Nine**...and Deep Space Nine, for that matter.

 > **PICARD**: Maximum warp. I am about to commit a direct violation of our orders. Any of you who wish to object should do so now. It will be noted in my log.
 >
 > **DATA**: Captain, I believe I speak for everyone here, sir, when I say...to Hell with our orders.

His digital brain moves so fast that he only came up with *that*, after a dramatic pause?  I feel like he (and the writers) could've done much better than mildly rephrase Spock's line at the end of [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}).

Also, I guess that we no longer care at all about that whole "warp drive tears up the fabric of spacetime," if they don't even need to talk about jumping straight to "maximum warp."

 > **WORF**: Report!

OK, so because we've done a bit more time travel than usual---not the kind relevant to the plot, but the order in which we consume the story---and because the franchise moved fast in those days, we find Worf over here instead of back on the *Enterprise*, because he transferred to DS9 at the start of that show's fourth season.  I gather that the remaining two films[^g6p8bl] will gin up increasingly improbable reasons for Worf to show up...

[^g6p8bl]:  If I haven't mentioned it before, seeing this in theaters mostly burned me out on the franchise, so I didn't catch up on the end of **Deep Space Nine** until I subscribed to Netflix, didn't see most of **Voyager** or any of **Enterprise** until a few years ago, and as I write this, have not seen **Insurrection** or **Nemesis** at all...

 > **PICARD**: This is Captain Picard of the *Enterprise*. I am taking command of the fleet. Target all of your weapons onto the following coordinates. Fire on my command.

Seriously?  In what flaky alternate reality would this ever work?  He barged in on a military action, in violation of his orders to steer clear, and decided that he could do a better job of running things.  And they *bought it*?

 > **DATA**: Sir, the coordinates you have indicated do not appear to be a vital system.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Trust me Data.

In the court-martial that we never get to see, about Picard violating orders to commandeer the entire fleet because he felt too important for his assigned duties, I hope that the prosecution points out how this looks like a scam.  Picard---already under suspicion of the Borg compromising him, and so ordered away from the fighting---declares himself too cool to follow his orders, and rushes to the fight, where a magical flash of insight lets him look like a hero by destroying the attacking Borg ship, even though Data didn't see how it could work *and* the writers created the Borg specifically for the "you can't repeatedly shoot them, because they adapt" suspense.

I don't want to suggest that anybody had this in mind when they wrote it, but if *I* wrote it, the Borg would've sacrificed a ship specifically to give Picard (feeding him the information to destroy it) a higher profile so that they could manipulate him later.

 > **RIKER**: Tough little ship.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: You do remember how to fire phasers?

They will never not find bigotry and microaggressions hilarious, I guess.

 > **SLOANE**: Come on.
 >
 > **COCHRANE**: Good night Eddie. Go home.

I'd do the "you might recognize [Alfre Woodard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfre_Woodard) and [James Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cromwell)" thing, but they got their names in the opening credits with the main cast, so that seems silly.  Also, it seems outright insulting to all of us to even pretend that you don't know Woodard when you see her.  I *will* mention in passing that we've already seen Cromwell in [*The Hunted*]({% post_url 2023-07-13-hunted %}) and [*Birthright*]({% post_url 2025-03-06-birthright-1 %}).  And played by someone else, we met Cochrane in [*Metamorphosis*]({% post_url 2020-10-08-meta %}).

 > **RIKER**: Makes sense. Most of the major cities have been destroyed. There are few governments left. Six hundred million dead. No resistance.

In the decade that we've known Riker, has he ever struck you as the sort of person who has studied history to any extent?

 > **PICARD**: Fire.

Well, that didn't take much.  Two for two, with his magic Borg-sense that definitely doesn't seem suspicious.

 > **RIKER**: Western hemisphere, North American continent. At a missile complex in central Montana.

He knows his Earth history, except for probably the most consequential event in it, I guess.  *That* sounds more like Riker.

 > **PICARD**: That's what they came here to do. Stop first contact.

Probably not, though, right?  We already know that they plan to assimilate Earth, because we saw the successful result in the future.  And if they do it *here*, then they get to start assimilating the Vulcans, as well.  Did they start only caring about Earth at some point, for some reason, and nobody bothered to mention it?

 > **HAWK**: I can't tell. Long-range sensors are still off-line.

You might recognize Hawk[^JHTksR] as [Neal McDonough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_McDonough), who has shown up pretty much everywhere, though I primarily recognize him from [**Tin Man**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Man_%28miniseries%29)...the diesel-punk Oz thing, not [the episode]({% post_url 2023-09-14-tin-man %}).

[^JHTksR]:  I should note that, while I don't know if they meant this as some sort of tribute to or mockery of their sibling-show, prior to **Deep Space Nine**, people primarily recognized Avery Brooks as fellow "for hire" Hawk on [**Spenser:  For Hire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spenser:_For_Hire) and its spinoff, **A Man Called Hawk**.

 > **PICARD**: Doctor...
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Please, no lectures about the Prime Directive. I will keep her unconscious.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Very well. Tell Commander Riker to beam down with a search party. We need to find Cochrane.

Notice Picard's response in this exchange.  He *absolutely* wanted to forbid her from saving a life, as if history records the Borg wiping everybody out.

 > **PICARD**: It's a boyhood fantasy, Data. I must have seen this ship hundreds of times in the Smithsonian, but I was never able to touch it.

At least until Donald Trump used his executive orders to blog about not liking references to his two impeachments in government-funded museums, the United States largely considered the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution) the country's most important and prestigious museums.  Presumably, Picard specifically saw the *Phoenix* at the [National Air and Space Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Air_and_Space_Museum), which has housed one of the [original *Enterprise* models](https://www.flickr.com/photos/99058495@N00/41451742962) for a long time.

More directly relevant, notice how Picard's comments here fit with his nineteenth-century approach to archaeology, that he believes that he has the right to grab and probably gnaw on whatever historical artifacts that fall into his field of vision.

 > **DATA**: I am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing. Temperature variations in the fuel manifold. It's no more real to me now than it was a moment ago.

Does the information not give him a deeper understanding of its presence?  Because he states it like new information, and you would think that might qualify as "more real," unless you enjoy playing the wet blanket[^9xDPhZ].

[^9xDPhZ]:  Actually, I think that gets to the root of what bothers me so much about this crew's story.  They all act like the worst junior high school students, self-serious and self-important, despising authority unless they have some to wield over others, always somehow simultaneously horny and sexless, and steadfastly refusing to show any real enthusiasm from anything, lest their friends laugh at them.  Speaking of that last one, when you get back to the main post, Troi's next line will hit at least two of those notes...

 > **TROI**: Would you three like to be alone?

They only have companionship because somebody walked in on them without knocking, so *now* who looks creepy, Counselor...?

 > **PICARD**: Ugh. If that's true then the future may die with him.

Yeah, where could they possibly find another pilot willing to pose as someone else for, like, five minutes?  I mean, apart from the multiple people who the show has put forth as standing among the best pilots in Starfleet.  They really only need Cochrane himself to show up when the Vulcans do; anything before that, his presence probably doesn't actually matter.

 > **TROI**: Captain, what is it?

It's a military rank and also a kind of honorary title for anybody in command of a ship, but that's not important right now...

C'mon, how often does anybody tee up that joke *this* well?

 > **CRUSHER**: I swore I'd never use one of these.  Computer, activate the EMH program.

I haven't watched **Voyager** in long enough to remember how they frame the technology, but I would think that Crusher's presence would (in the general case) mean that they don't *have* the kind of emergency that they made this for.  In other words, she shouldn't need to swear to never use one, because they didn't make them for her to use.

I get the joke that nobody likes the hologram's personality, but a doctor swearing to never use one comes off like a person swearing to never shop for their own coffin:  Usually, that purchase happens *because* you have become unavailable for shopping trips...

Less relevant, Ogawa makes an appearance, here, last spotted in [*Genesis*]({% post_url 2025-10-02-genesis %}).

 > **EMH**: Please state the nature of the medical emergency.

If you know the franchise, then you probably don't need me to walk you through recognizing [Robert Picardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Picardo), who starred in **Voyager** and the second season of **Prodigy** as a different version of this character, but also feels like he has appeared pretty much everywhere for almost fifty years.

 > **EMH**: This isn't part of my program. I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.

One imagines that the first act of [**Generations**]({% post_url 2022-04-28-generations %}) answers this for me, but do people read through old ship logs?  After all, I realize that, if this film came out today, we'd have a flood of articles and (snicker) video essays carefully dissecting this "Easter egg[^Fj0UoE]," but in-universe, I can't see any way that the computer lands on this phrasing unless the programmer expected patients to recognize McCoy's speech patterns from a century ago well enough to get the joke.

[^Fj0UoE]:  I hate the over-use of the term, because you *hunt* for Easter eggs, as in an [Easter egg hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_hunt).  When the work goes far out of its way to draw attention to the reference, you can't rightly hunt for it.

 > **DATA**: Excellent idea. Plasma coolant will liquefy organic material on contact.

Mass murder in the most disgusting manner possible qualifies as an excellent idea.  "Oh," I hear you cry, "but they need to stop the Borg."  Sure, except that still seems murder-y, and quietly ignores the engineering staff down there who would also die.

 > **PICARD**: One other thing. You may encounter *Enterprise* crew-members who've already been assimilated. Don't hesitate to fire. Believe me you'll be doing them a favor. Let's go.

Or---and please hear me out, here---they could maybe *rescue* any such colleagues instead of murdering them.  We know that they have the ability to do that, because they did that for Picard in [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-11-09-best-both-worlds-part-2 %}).  Does he resent them for saving him?  Or maybe he means that he wouldn't want to live life as a Starfleet peon.

 > **RIKER**: Deanna! Deanna! Deanna!

The franchise has discovered cultural artifacts outside the 1930s, stretching all the way forward to 1955 for [*Ooby Dooby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Penner#%22Ooby_Dooby%22).  You'll notice, though, how clear they make it that Riker and Troi don't approve.

 > **COCHRANE**: Who is this jerk? And who told him he could turn off my music?

At least somebody notices Riker's role besides me.

 > **TROI**: If you're looking for my professional opinion as ship's Counselor, he's nuts.

Hilarious ableism from the person (allegedly) dedicated to caring about people.  How do any of them still have a job?

 > **PICARD**: Lower your weapons. They'll ignore us 'til they consider us a threat.

Maybe also don't completely block their path, then?

Also, it makes them seem much less like dangerous enemies when they don't mind you hanging out and watching them work, not to mention that they only boarded the *Enterprise* at all because Picard blew up their ball-ship.

 > **PICARD**: Regroup on deck fifteen. Don't let them touch you!

[Cooties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooties) rules now apply, I see.

 > **LYNCH**: Captain! Help. Please, help.

Yep.  Picard literally murdered a colleague---posing no threat and begging for help, I might add---in cold blood, because saving lives feels less cathartic.

I realize that I have brought up current events in the United States already, but it does seem worth comparing Picard's callousness to the [strike killing survivors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_military_strikes_on_alleged_drug_traffickers#Survivors_and_follow-up_strike) of the strikes against alleged drug traffickers.  Again, while the Borg absolutely fired on Earth, this batch of drones only made it here as survivors of Picard's strike against their ship and (as Picard made it clear) didn't attack the crew until Picard threatened them.  And I mention all that because, if we posit that the Federation has declared war against the Borg, pretty much every society considers this a textbook example of a war crime...in the literal sense of using it as an example in textbooks.

 > **BORG QUEEN**: Brave words. I've heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds since long before you were created. But now they are all Borg.

Again, you probably already know this, because she'll go on to reprise this role in **Voyager**, **Lower Decks**, and **Picard**, but when we actually see the Queen---ignore that the concept makes no sense---you might recognize her as [Alice Krige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Krige), who has similarly appeared all over television and film for almost fifty years.

 > **TROI**: It unites humanity in a way no one ever thought possible when they realize they're not alone in the universe. Poverty, disease, war. They'll all be gone within the next fifty years.

I have asked this before, but *really*?  Then why do these shows spend so much time on rushing the *Enterprise* off to stop some plague or to fight someone?  Why do so many people work jobs that they hate?  Every time that Picard or Troi---I don't think that anybody else mentions it---brings it up, it almost feels like they include an implicit footnote of "among the people who matter."  Last week, for example, Donald Trump announced that [he made everything affordable](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/president-trump-delivers-progress-on-lowering-costs-with-much-more-relief-on-the-way/)[^QyeJEH]---again, executive orders now pretty much serve as blog posts---so either don't believe your lying eyes or wallet, or assume that he made life more affordable for the limited list of people who matter to him, such as new *Star Trek* franchise owner (via Paramount) Larry Ellison, who suddenly has an extra seventy-eight billion dollars around to potentially take Warner Brothers over.

[^QyeJEH]:  He did, however, advise Pennsylvanians to give up pencils shortly after, maybe not realizing or caring that the writing implement and state---contrary to *Rhode Island Is Famous for You*---have nothing to do with each other.

Mind you, if we really want to actually speculate, we could imagine a likely alternate reason for the disparity that feels consistent with other things that characters have said:  They see the poverty, disease, and war in their time as something "brought in" by non-humans, a legendary utopia that they've somehow lost because of space-DEI or whatever and need to make great again.

 > **COCHRANE**: And you people, you're all astronauts, on some kind of...star trek?

As I said in *All Good Things...*, **Do you get it?  He said the words in the title.  Laugh, because...** {% emoji person shrugging %}

 > **SLOANE**: There's no glass.

What?  Then why did they spend so many seasons sending La Forge out to find windows, if they don't have anything obstructing their vision?  I assumed that they only had video feeds of outside, to protect the crew from radiation and blinding lights, but apparently not.

 > **DATA**: As you seem to know so much about me, you must be aware that I am programmed to evolve and better myself.
 >
 > **BORG QUEEN**: We too are on a quest to better ourselves. Evolving toward a state of perfection.
 >
 > **DATA**: Forgive me. The Borg do not evolve. They conquer.

I feel the need to point out that, in **Generations**, Data had a whole boring song-and-dance about how he couldn't evolve without plugging in his emotion chip.  It doesn't really feel like he has grounds to argue that the Borg can't evolve, if he now thinks that he does.  What do his constant attempts at mimicry sound like, if not "we will add your distinctiveness to our own"?

 > **PICARD**: The economics of the future are somewhat different. You see, money doesn't exist in the twenty-fourth century.
 >
 > **SLOANE**: No money! That means you don't get paid.
 >
 > **PICARD**: The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. Actually we're rather like yourself and Doctor Cochrane. All right! Come on.

I say this a lot, but this really does come across as less than sincere coming from the man who grew up in his ancestral French castle and felt torn between running the family business, and gallivanting around the galaxy pillaging cultural sites of historical significance, before settling on climbing the ladder with Starfleet, especially when we have seen people who work menial jobs, presumably not to "better themselves," except in the sense that paying the rent improves life dramatically.  Likewise, following up on Troi, she descends from an important aristocratic family that inherits holy rings and sacred chalices and the like.

Plus, as I have pointed out a few times over the years, they must have something like money flowing, even if they call it something else, otherwise Starfleet and the Federation would make completely different decisions about health care, construction, and a bunch of other fields.

 > **PICARD**: Perhaps something in satin?

He calls up **The Big Goodbye**, referencing [the episode]({% post_url 2022-08-04-big-goodbye %}).

 > **MAÎTRE D'**: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we're closing, and you do understand we have a strict dress code? So, if you boys don't leave right now, I'll...

Once again, if you know the franchise, then you probably already recognize [Ethan Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Phillips), who played Neelix over on **Voyager**, though we also ran across him in [*Ménage à Troi*]({% post_url 2023-10-12-menage-troi %}).  Like Picardo and Krige, he has *also* worked fairly consistently and widely for almost the past fifty years.

 > **PICARD**: Try and look as if you're having a good time.

Maybe I would, if you didn't make this such a slog.  Oh, he probably didn't mean me.  Sorry...

Also, we have again slipped free of the 1930s, but only to 1942 for [*Moonlight Becomes You*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Becomes_You_%28song%29) in the background, most notably recorded by Bing Crosby, which I point out because somebody missed a prime opportunity to have his granddaughter show up, if they wanted to play the "do you get the joke?" game so often.

Unrelated, I gather that this scene exists mostly to get some of the production crew on-screen.

 > **PICARD**: I disengaged the safety protocols. Without them even a holographic bullet can kill.

Again, it seems absurdly reckless to even *have* that possibility, like if soccer balls had switches on them that, if you toggle it off, might inject ricin into the player's bloodstream.

 > **PICARD**: Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

We'll leave it here for now, with the fun cold-blooded murder of another colleague who they could've restored, and pick up the story with La Forge harassing Cochrane back at the Montana camp.

## Conclusions

In cultural terms, we reinforce the idea that they dislike popular culture starting in World War II, though they have some familiarity with opera.

### The Bad

We manage, in the same scene, to both see the obsession with viewing the Romulans as a threat to intimidate and an admission that the fear has no basis in fact.

In addition, we see that the crew genuinely sees their routine assignments as not worth their time and talents, especially if it doesn't involve violence.  Likewise, they seem to have such a hierarchical society that someone claiming to have authority can walk in and take charge, despite orders to stay away.

They continue to endure microaggressions against people from disadvantaged groups.  But they don't seem to pay attention at all, not even remembering their self-appointed mission or its reason.

The Federation seems to (still) consider life cheap.  Picard nearly claims that the Prime Directive should forbid Crusher from saving a historical figure's life before she finishes her work, proposes dissolving all organic material near the Borg, and outright murders a colleague.  They also completely dismiss the possibility of saving crew captured by the Borg.

We also see a lot of anti-intellectual sentiment, from generally not really understanding history, to Picard's insistence that he deserves to touch historical artifacts, to Data's insistence that more information about an object doesn't make it more real, to mocking any sign of excitement, to not understanding emergency systems.

They also continue to maintain that they live in some perfect society with no problems, despite the evidence that we have seen for years.

And they still have terrible computer systems that might kill them if they don't remember to flip the "don't do that" switch.

### The Weird

They appear to have dismissed their concerns about warp drive damaging space.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the franchise tries to get with the times and try modern music (from 1968) one more time in the second half of **First Contact**...
