As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

If people can freely express their opinions, after all, how can the administration convince anybody that people don't *really* want clean air and water...?

 > ...either continue reacting to the news cycle or commit to something more visionary: a movement that centers the most marginalized survivors, challenges systemic violence and invests in healing over punishment.

It feels ironic that people need to pitch this as an innovation, when these people shared their stories to *convince* us to bring down this system designed to enable abuse.

 > The law made historically deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP to fund tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, plus enormous subsidies for for-profit Pentagon and ICE contractors. As a result, 17 million Americans will lose their health coverage, killing 51,000 people every year. Millions more will go without food, including children.

This article nails it.  They pitch their imaginary crime waves to distract from the legitimate issues piling up, and to provoke violence against marginalized communities, so that we lose focus, even if we *don't* fall for the distractions.

Don't worry, though, the Trump administration has already started gutting the environmental regulations, so that we won't need to worry about the woke scourge of healthy grandchildren.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics, Military action in civilian territory %}

 > Thatâ€™s also true in the states whose GOP governors are voluntarily sending National Guard troops to the capital. Across those six states â€” Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia â€” some 30,000 people are unhoused. The daily cost of operating safe shelter for all 30,000 would be less than one day of the D.C. occupation.

I've said this before, probably repeatedly, but maybe we should stop looking to the people who hate the government to *run the government*.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Trumpâ€™s Epstein problem is real: New poll shows many in his base disapprove of his handling of the files, and some supporters are having second thoughts about electing him](https://theconversation.com/trumps-epstein-problem-is-real-new-poll-shows-many-in-his-base-disapprove-of-his-handling-of-the-files-and-some-supporters-are-having-second-thoughts-about-electing-him-263662) from The Conversation

 > When we drill down on the 47% of 2024 Trump voters who disapprove of Trumpâ€™s handling of the Epstein controversy, we find significant cracks in the MAGA faÃ§ade. Among members of this group, 28% now disapprove of Trump as president.

It turns out that you can potentially go to the "all part of the plan, just trust us" well only so often, before people start to consider that maybe it actually looks like a cover-up because you've covered things up, and not because of some drawn-out con to finally ensnare the diabolical ~~Hamburglar~~ Bill Clinton.
