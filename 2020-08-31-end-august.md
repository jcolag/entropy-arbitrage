Yep.  No holidays.  No birthdays that caught my interest.  It's just the last day of August, meaning we're entering the season of decent holidays.  OK, that's actually not true.  There are quite a few regional and diaspora-based holidays.  It's also [Alma Mahler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Mahler)'s 141<sup>st</sup> birthday, which is fun, but licensing would forbid me from embedding Tom Lehrer's [song about her <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL6KgbrGSKQ).

But tomorrow?  Tomorrow is [Emma Nutt Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nutt#Commemoration), celebrating the world's first female telephone operator.  Things look up quickly, in other words.

I finally decided to make saving twtxt messages to the database an optional feature, turned off by default, so I'll probably start slowly working the required infrastructure into place in stages that won't break anybody's experience.

To be serious about the URLs being the "keys," the mentions should probably search for them, too.  A useful side-effect of that change would be that a user could (in theory) rename people's handles locally to distinguish between people with the same handle, without fouling up any of the other information.
