As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The researchers performed genetic testing on the fungal samples to trace the history and spread of powdery mildew disease. Interestingly, none of the old specimens have the same genetic makeup, or genotype, as the specimens currently spreading throughout the world.

 > Meta has made an overt shift to the right, and Mark Zuckerberg has himself become a Trump booster. The platform is making its content moderation worse, has declared that immigrants and LGBTQ+ people are legitimate targets for hate speech, and has made many of these changes at the behest of the Trump White House and Stephen Miller...

You probably already know that I agree with this, since I've screamed about this for a long time.  About two years ago, I even posted [*Why Federate?*]({% post_url 2023-04-23-federation %}), pointing out that corporate ownership doesn't work, because a dollar value exists that puts the apparatus into the hands of somebody who wants to destroy it.

 > With these choices, corporate media outlets make a rightward societal shift appear inevitable. Movement mediaâ€™s role is to resist that tendency, and offer an alternative. We have a responsibility to remind people of what we have lost, and what we could still win.

I don't generally go in for these "this group must follow my directions" articles, but this goes into enough detail that it informs people of what to look for.

I actually have trouble grasping how weak and insecure these weirdos must feel, that they feel the need to perform the worst traditions of masculinity *and* demand that everybody around them perform it for them, too...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113918393200054095)

 > Man is an intellectual animal, therefore an everlasting contradiction to himself. His senses center in himself, his ideas reach to the ends of the universe; so that he is torn in pieces between the two without the possibility of its ever being otherwise. A mere physical being or a pure spirit can alone be satisfied with itself.

True, even in the best relationships, here, paying someone for a place to live, purely because they had the fortune to buy property first, feels fully objectionable, especially given the broader economics discussed in the article.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Not surprisingly, these efficiently dividing mutated blood cell clones were linked to risk for blood cancer. But they were also associated with increased [risk for heart disease](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1701719), stroke and death by any cause, perhaps because they [promote inflammation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-019-0247-5). And unexpectedly, they were associated with about [a one-third _lower_ risk of Alzheimerâ€™s dementia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02397-2). Jaiswal, who coauthored an article on the [health impacts of blood cell clones](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-med-042921-112347) in the 2023 _Annual Review of Medicine_, speculates that some clones might be better at populating brain tissue or clearing away toxic proteins.

I expect that a lot of readers will find this interesting.

 > In the [Napenda Solar Community](https://www.africaexpeditionsupport.com/napenda-solar-community/), located south of Nairobi, residents not only gain access to clean energy. They also receive training on how solar systems work, how to build them, and how to maintain them. This knowledge empowers communities to operate and manage these systems independently for the long term. In rural regions without access to centralized power grids, such projects provide a reliable and sustainable energy supply.

Notice that we're seeing reporting about renewable energy adoption almost everywhere...except for the West.
