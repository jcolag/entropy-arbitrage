While I don't expect to go through *all* [Black History Month](/blog/tag/black-history-month) reprinting the works of Black writers, I do like the excuse to highlight it.  And while last week we had the final chapter of Carter G. Woodson's [**The Negro in Our History**]({% post_url 2026-02-08-negro-our-history %}) largely because I found and enjoyed it, this time I wanted fiction that actually fit the season.

Part of the first generation of fully freeborn African Americans, born a decade after the end of the American Civil War, [Alice Dunbar Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Dunbar_Nelson)...did a lot.  You'll find her journalism, prose fiction, poetry, political activism, and more.  In a lot of ways, you can see her as a "founder" of the Harlem Renaissance, bot central to the movement and well established in her career by the 1920s, and sadly dead by 1935 at the age of only sixty.  And then, even in death, she became an important journalist of sorts, with her diaries used by researchers to piece together the lives of Black women during and after Reconstruction.

This post presents her *A Carnival Jangle*, a short story from **Violets and Other Tales** (1895), which I picked for two reasons[^NaSzEq].  First, I wanted to get something lighter and entertaining today (if dark), instead of a literal chunk of textbook like last week or my half-formed thoughts on the desperation for proximity for power that we see in the Epstein files and the Trump administration's related desperation to avoid talking about it.

[^NaSzEq]:  OK, three reasons, because yes, I *did* throw this post together at the last minute, as you might have guessed by how late this went out...

Second, as you can probably guess by the title, the story takes place at [Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival), which starts...tomorrow, I believe---reaching its height on Tuesday for [Mardi Gras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras)---making this the time to present it.  I don't really engage with the late-winter/early-spring Christian holidays, but I appreciate the spectacle of Carnival.

And with that, other than a quick advisory that you'll get some outdated and troublesome terms for Native Americans and only a couple of tiny edits to modernize the text[^x22CYc], I'll get out of the way and let Nelson entertain you.

[^x22CYc]:  For the pedants, I added the cedilla accent to *garçon* and removed the hyphen from *daredevil*.

## A Carnival Jangle

There is a merry jangle of bells in the air, an all-pervading sense of jester's noise, and the flaunting vividness of royal colors; the streets swarm with humanity,---humanity in all shapes, manners, forms,---laughing, pushing, jostling, crowding, a mass of men and women and children, as varied and as assorted in their several individual peculiarities as ever a crowd that gathered in one locality since the days of Babel.

It is Carnival in New Orleans; a brilliant Tuesday in February, when the very air effervesces an ozone intensely exhilarating---of a nature half spring, half winter---to make one long to cut capers. The buildings are a blazing mass of royal purple and golden yellow, and national flags, bunting and decorations that laugh in the glint of the Midas sun. The streets a crush of jesters and maskers, Jim Crows and clowns, ballet girls and Mephistos, Indians and monkeys; of wild and sudden flashes of music, of glittering pageants and comic ones, of befeathered and belled horses. A madding dream of color and melody and fantasy gone wild in an effervescent bubble of beauty that shifts and changes and passes kaleidoscope-like before the bewildered eye.

A bevy of bright-eyed girls and boys of that uncertainty of age that hovers between childhood and maturity, were moving down Canal Street when there was a sudden jostle with another crowd meeting them. For a minute there was a deafening clamor of laughter, cracking of whips, which all maskers carry, jingle and clatter of carnival bells, and the masked and unmasked extricated themselves and moved from each other's paths. But in the confusion a tall Prince of Darkness had whispered to one of the girls in the unmasked crowd: "You'd better come with us, Flo, you're wasting time in that tame gang. Slip off, they'll never miss you; we'll get you a rig, and show you what life is."

And so it happened that when a half hour passed, and the bright-eyed bevy missed Flo and couldn't find her, wisely giving up the search at last, that she, the quietest and most bashful of the lot, was being initiated into the mysteries of "what life is."

Down Bourbon Street and on Toulouse and St. Peter Streets there are quaint little old-world places, where one may be disguised effectually for a tiny consideration. Thither guided by the shapely Mephisto, and guarded by the team of jockeys and ballet girls, tripped Flo. Into one of the lowest-ceiled, dingiest and most ancient-looking of these disguise shops they stopped.

"A disguise for this demoiselle," announced Mephisto to the woman who met them. She was small and wizened and old, with yellow, flabby jaws and neck like the throat of an alligator, and straight, white hair that stood from her head uncannily stiff.

"But the demoiselle wishes to appear a boy, _un petit garçon_?" she inquired, gazing eagerly at Flo's long, slender frame. Her voice was old and thin, like the high quavering of an imperfect tuning fork, and her eyes were sharp as talons in their grasping glance.

"Mademoiselle does not wish such a costume," gruffly responded Mephisto.

"_Ma foi_, there is no other," said the ancient, shrugging her shoulders. "But one is left now, mademoiselle would make a fine troubadour."

"Flo," said Mephisto, "it's a daredevil scheme, try it; no one will ever know it but us, and we'll die before we tell. Besides, we must; it's late, and you couldn't find your crowd."

And that was why you might have seen a Mephisto and a slender troubadour of lovely form, with mandolin flung across his shoulder, followed by a bevy of jockeys and ballet girls, laughing and singing as they swept down Rampart Street.

When the flash and glare and brilliancy of Canal Street have palled upon the tired eye, and it is yet too soon to go home, and to such a prosaic thing as dinner, and one still wishes for novelty, then it is wise to go in the lower districts. Fantasy and fancy and grotesqueness in the costuming and behavior of the maskers run wild. Such dances and whoops and leaps as these hideous Indians and devils do indulge in; such wild curvetings and great walks. And in the open squares, where whole groups do congregate, it is wonderfully amusing. Then, too, there is a ball in every available hall, a delirious ball, where one may dance all day for ten cents; dance and grow mad for joy, and never know who were your companions, and be yourself unknown. And in the exhilaration of the day, one walks miles and miles, and dances and curvets, and the fatigue is never felt.

In Washington Square, away down where Royal Street empties its stream of children and men into the broad channel of Elysian Fields Avenue, there was a perfect Indian dance. With a little imagination one might have willed away the vision of the surrounding houses and fancied one's self again in the forest, where the natives were holding a sacred riot. The square was filled with spectators, masked and unmasked. It was amusing to watch these mimic Red-men, they seemed so fierce and earnest.

Suddenly one chief touched another on the elbow. "See that Mephisto and troubadour over there?" he whispered huskily.

"Yes, who are they?"

"I don't know the devil," responded the other quietly, "but I'd know that other form anywhere. It's Leon, see? I know those white hands like a woman's and that restless head. Ha!"

"But there may be a mistake."

"No. I'd know that one anywhere; I feel it's him. I'll pay him now. Ah, sweetheart, you've waited long, but you shall feast now!" He was caressing something long, and lithe, and glittering beneath his blanket.

In a masked dance it is easy to give a death-blow between the shoulders. Two crowds meet and laugh and shout and mingle almost inextricably, and if a shriek of pain should arise, it is not noticed in the din, and when they part, if one should stagger and fall bleeding to the ground, who can tell who has given the blow? There is naught but an unknown stiletto on the ground, the crowd has dispersed, and masks tell no tales anyway. There is murder, but by whom? For what? _Quien sabe?_

And that is how it happened on Carnival night, in the last mad moments of Rex's reign, a broken-hearted woman sat gazing wide-eyed and mute at a horrible something that lay across the bed. Outside the long sweet march music of many bands floated in in mockery, and the flash of rockets and Bengal lights illumined the dead, white face of the girl troubadour.

## Back to the Blog

OK, I admittedly didn't expect the teaser for a detective show episode, especially after the pseudo-mystical setup.  But it'd make a heck of a setup, right?

Oh, and [curvets](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curvet) refer to pranks in this context, but more generally the archetypal equestrian jump, where the forelegs rise as a unit and, as they descend, the hind legs rise, so that the horse doesn't touch the ground and maintains symmetry.
