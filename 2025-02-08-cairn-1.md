This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Cairn**.

![The book's cover, with a script-like title over thorny vegetation, with small hands poking up near the bottom of the image](/blog/assets/cairn.png "Not the most exciting beginning, but we'll see...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Cairn, Players Guide and Background

The game's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn) has the following to say.

 > Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). There are two editions (see sidebar) both of which are rules-compatible.

The game also lists the following principles, which might give a clearer idea of how to interpret things.

 > ### Neutrality
 >
 > The Warden's role is to act as a neutral arbiter and portray the rules, situations, non-player characters (NPCs), and narrative clearly.
 >
 > ### Classless
 >
 > A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, and their experiences define their specialty.
 >
 > ### Death
 >
 > Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.
 >
 > ### Fiction First
 >
 > Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are based on in-world elements and arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players.
 >
 > ### Growth
 >
 > Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
 >
 > ### Player Choice
 >
 > Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.
 >
 > ### Principles
 >
 > The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.
 >
 > ### Shared Objectives
 >
 > Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

It continues on that way, but you get the general idea.

## What Works Well?

This probably varies based on personal taste, but as somebody who always objected to the weird personal rigor of traditional fantasy games, I like the idea that, rather than character classes, characters mostly have primary careers.  And while a realistic system would probably have more than twenty options, those "backgrounds" seem distinct enough and flexible enough that most players will find something that works.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Right at the start, it at least seems *peculiar* for all characters to have an age of 2d20+10.  Like, I don't know if people realize this, but people younger than twenty-one and older than thirty actually make up the majority of most populations, and you can totally work with people from other age groups...

This might get corrected in the Warden's Guide, but the world feels incredibly flimsy, from a name that sounds suspiciously like "world," to the assertion that we shouldn't worry about the government, to only really describing the world as forests and dungeons, with the towns and cities almost looking like an afterthought that we shouldn't talk about.

## Opportunities

 > This is a game that values community contributions! If you'd like to submit an adventure, hack, monster, or conversion take a look at the [submission guide](https://cairnrpg.com/submissions/submission-guide/).

I won't bother to quote their page on the topic...

## What's Adaptable?

It looks like we only get the broadest strokes of the kingdom of Vald, whose king we don't find relevant enough to discuss.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading **Cairn**, specifically the Wardens Guide from *About the Example Party* to *Growth*.  If you reach *Knowledge and Perception*, then you've gone too far.  Note that we'll (as usual) ignore most of the mechanics, unless something sticks out as especially interesting.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game's world so far?
