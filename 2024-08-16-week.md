* Ignore for ToC

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112949200655370849) [Racism and discrimination lead to faster aging through brain network changes](https://theconversation.com/racism-and-discrimination-lead-to-faster-aging-through-brain-network-changes-new-study-finds-233959) from The Conversation

 > Racial discrimination is a ubiquitous stressor that often goes unnoticed. It might look like a doctor questioning a Black patient‚Äôs pain level and not prescribing pain medication, or a teacher calling a Black child a ‚Äúthug.‚Äù It is a constant stressor faced by Black people starting at an early age.

Hashtags:  #Racism #Aging #Health

It occurs to me that "often goes unnoticed" has two meanings in that quoted bit, both pretty terrible.  Racism "often goes unnoticed" by most of us, because we can afford not to care, to some extent, and the people who can't ignore it don't trust us enough to confide in us.  For the people who experience it directly, racism "often goes unnoticed" because it happens so often that they notice it about as often as we notice air.

We have a *lot* of work to do.

 > ...the modern far right is no longer made up of organizations with clear hierarchical structures. Instead, it is an international and online-networked movement. It organizes around a shared ideology spread by a core of theorists, leaders and influencers who use their power to put out statements designed to trigger others to commit violence.

While I don't agree that Great Replacement trash "drives" them---*hate* drives them, and Great Replacement gives them a marketable excuse that na√Øve journalists find novel enough to help them spread---definitely take lessons from the structural points.

 > Mastodon For Harris continues to fundraise for the Harris campaign, and harnesses a growing amount of energy and enthusiasm as different groups across the network converge together.

Hashtags:  #USPol #MastodonForHarris #Activism

The article has a section on people finding the situation uncomfortable, and I posted this primarily to make the point that other causes can and should *learn from this*.  No, your mutual aid network[^1] doesn't have the benefit of constant media coverage like the Harris campaign rightly benefits from, but it doesn't take that to replicate what they did to get the word out on this specific fundraising push.

[^1]:  I feel sorely tempted to put sarcasm-quotes around the mutual aid network phrase, because it feels like an excuse, a hypothetical cause to suggest that the Fediverse shouldn't waste time on preventing the fascist oligarchy outlined openly in [Project 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025).  People always have these causes that they don't usually contribute to themselves, but think that you should instead of whatever you decided to do...

 > It begins with public education. States can play a critical role to ensure residents have the tools and resources they need to make informed reproductive health care decisions ‚Äî and avoid dangerous and deceptive anti-abortion centers.

Hashtags:  #Abortion #Education

These anti-abortion centers have always worried me the most about the forced-birth movement, because they seem illegal on almost every level.  They pretend to offer medical care without a license.  They collect medical information and store it on servers.  And they advertise in ways meant to deceive.  I've probably forgotten a few aspects, too, but you get my point.  It feels like Attorney Generals could make names for themselves fairly quickly by wiping most of these groups off the map.

 > Terawulf is a scam from top to bottom. Its NY state permit application promises not to pursue cryptocurrency mining, a thing it was actively trumpeting its plan to do even as it filed that application.

Hashtags:  #Crypto #Fraud

I can't help but notice that all these inane industries have started joining forces to prop each other up.  While burning more coal won't end in anything good, it still feels somewhat gratifying to see that cryptocurrencies and AI. in particular, now seem to exist primarily to give coal power plants customers.  I call it gratifying, because these sorts of alliances have the virtue of making the targets more vulnerable by how they cluster together...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Faster, cleaner method recovers lithium from battery waste](https://www.futurity.org/lithium-recovery-battery-waste-3243752/) from Futurity

 > Conventional recycling methods often involve harsh acids, while alternative eco-friendly solvents like deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have struggled with efficiency and economic viability. Moreover, current recycling methods recover less than 5% of lithium, largely due to contamination and loss during the process as well as the energy intensive nature of recovery.

Speaking of dealing with electricity, it would definitely improve everybody's lives if lithium became less problematic...

 > The Truth Commission, which published a final report in 2014, pointed to 377 people responsible for human rights violations in Brazil and counted 434 people dead or disappeared by the State. The violations suffered by Coelho are mentioned in the second volume of the report.

I don't really have anything to say, here, other than that you should probably read the article.
