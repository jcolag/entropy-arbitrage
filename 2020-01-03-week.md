As [promised (or threatened)]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is the first weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.

The Twitter icons <i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> (if I put this together correctly) should link to the original tweets.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1212373409440493568) [Brain discovery upends ideas about attention](https://www.futurity.org/selective-attention-brain-2239912/) from Futurity

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1212736300677124097) [2019: The year in heists and capers](https://qz.com/1746371/2019-the-year-in-heists-and-capers/) from Quartz (paywall)

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1213098436872028161) [Mike Bloomberg Exploited Prison Labor to Make 2020 Presidential Campaign Phone Calls](https://theintercept.com/2019/12/24/mike-bloomberg-2020-prison-labor/) from The Intercept

 > Friedmann said that whether or not the Bloomberg campaign knew about the arrangement with ProCom, it was responsible.
 
Yet his reporters work on [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/sanders-warren-campaigns-spend-most-on-amazon-while-trashing-it)

**Note**:  It didn't fit in a tweet, but the difference drawn between the Intercept's reporting and Bloomberg's refers to [Bloomberg News will not investigate Mike Bloomberg or his Democratic rivals during primary](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/24/bloomberg-news-will-not-investigate-mike-bloomberg-or-his-democratic-rivals-during-primary.html).  They did so anyway, in the pettiest way I can imagine, but somehow didn't bother to check out their boss's campaign, which is notably due to their "tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation)," as John Micklethwait put it when announcing their lack of investigation.
