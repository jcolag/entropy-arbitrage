As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 26 May 2025

I took Memorial Day off, once I published the week's [developer diary post]({% post_url 2025-05-26-memorial %}).

 > ...we do see a concentration of agricultural operations in the South. We also know that in the South there‚Äôs a greater number of prisons in that region compared to other parts of the US.

Hashtags:  #Incarceration #Slavery

Heck of a coincidence that we see a strong racial correlation with prisons, a distinct bias in the locations of prisons, and a trend in the work that we force prisoners to do unpaid.  You might almost see a pattern in the system that has nothing to do with justice.

 > Ye, whose comments would get a student expelled or a professor fired, was welcomed at Trump's private club. The message was clear: what matters is not what you say about Jews, but where you stand in the power structure.

We should also note that Trump uses this same framework to root out corruption.  If you want to understand why big company CEOs have lined up to kneel before Trump, look no further than his ability to direct Pam Bondi's DoJ to overlook crimes by companies that he likes, while going after those he---and his cronies---see as enemies.

{% cw Eugenics %}

 > The wealthy have created a system of dynastic wealth that puts the aristocratic method of primogenitor in the shade. Every scion of every one-percenter can have their own fortune and start their own dynasty, without lifting a finger. Their sole job is to sign the paperwork put before them by ‚Äúwealth managers.‚Äù

Hashtags:  #Eugenics

In addition to what Doctorow has to say, often overlooked whenever anybody talks about meritocracy, we can use *anything* for "merit."  We tend to bring our own interpretations to the word instead of asking whether the system judges merit through careful assessments of abilities and results, multiple choice quizzes, net worth of assets, race, gender, or bloodline.  The idea of merit has enough slipperiness to it that you can imagine experts in ideal positions, and never notice the inbred family taking control of everything.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Trump #Budget

I have to admit that I like the "Big, Beautiful Bill," certainly not in anything that it wants to accomplish in the country, but in how it has changed the Republicans' explanations from simplistic fodder for bumper stickers---think "reduce the debt," "back the blue," or "abortion is murder" for examples---to complicated songs and dances to explain how gutting everything that keeps Republican-voting communities afloat will secretly benefit them.  For too long, Republicans have gotten away with quick sound-bites as policy, but that can only work here if their constituents go out of their way to avoid knowing about the bill.

And it'll get worse if/when the bill gets through the Senate, because Republicans there want even *deeper* cuts...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114597636350124570)

 > The last year has really brought home that it is truly a matter of life and death. The tangible, human stakes, the real-life consequences when we are led by fools, and when we are led by people who are more concerned with their own enrichment than they are with the financial well-being of the families that pay their salary.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://images.theconversation.com/files/669078/original/file-20250520-56-9j7qsa.jpg|A person holding a small sign with the word EMPATHY in capital letters|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Empathy can take a toll ‚Äì but 2 philosophers explain why we should see it as a strength](https://theconversation.com/empathy-can-take-a-toll-but-2-philosophers-explain-why-we-should-see-it-as-a-strength-254554) from The Conversation

 > ...[it takes courage](https://philpapers.org/rec/ATIKBA) to empathically engage with others, just as it takes courage to see and recognize problems around us. Conversely, an unwillingness to empathize can stem from a familiar weakness: a fear of knowledge.

I'd go even further than their research.  Not only does empathy exercise and demonstrate courage, but it also allows us to cooperate in meaningful ways.  It makes perfect sense that the far-right hates it.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Too Easy LoL: messages written on cell wall as ten inmates escape from Orleans Parish Prison in Louisiana](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/%22Too_Easy_LoL%22:_messages_written_on_cell_wall_as_ten_inmates_escape_from_Orleans_Parish_Prison_in_Louisiana,_United_States) from Wikinews

 > Surveillance footage showed the escapees leaving through a dock door, scaling a wall, with some then running across to the interstate. Photos from the sheriff‚Äôs office revealed a large hole behind the toilet in the cell, with graffiti above it reading ‚ÄúWe Innocent‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo Easy LoL.‚Äù

I couldn't rightly ignore this story, could I?  Connect this with the Tuesday story, and you start to see a full picture form, where prisons only exist to preserve slavery, hoping that the inmates will feel too demoralized to walk through their lax security.  And instead of reflecting on that, they'll waste money on security, because they can't even consider putting rehabilitation on the table.
