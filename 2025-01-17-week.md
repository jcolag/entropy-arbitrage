As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I know, it seems so incredibly difficult to believe that Republicans would only care about the problems in US society that directly affect people who look like them.  And yet, they somehow manage to do it every time...

I've never really liked leather, personally, but it does seem rather clear that *any* product coming from cattle has exactly the same footprint as every other, because they literally have the same supply chain...

At the same time they pretend that everybody at the company loves their new right-wing overlords credibly accused of hurting women, remember that Meta has also chosen to roll out "AI users," roll back moderation rules aimed at curbing hate speech, eliminated its DEI programs, removed themes designed to make transgender folks more comfortable, and laying off employees because he'd rather work with AI.  You can't always tell social media's politics, because their criteria for profitability looks suspiciously like right-wing policy, frightening and angering people, so that they stay on the site.  But sometimes, they make it abundantly clear where their loyalties lie.

It not only reflects his misogynist, oligarchical views, but also gives him a massive business giveaway by eliminating his most credible competitors by spreading fear about China.

I've probably mentioned this before, but in college and my early career, it seemed like we had fairly close to gender parity in software.  Over the years, though---and I regret not taking the time to understand it and stand up to it---female colleagues saw their work marginalized as managers passed them over for promotions, not to mention colleagues assuming that any success that they found came from personal relationships with better developers.

In parallel to my experience, I've heard so many stories of younger women outright bullied and sabotaged in college by their peers.

And then we wondered why they quit, changed majors or careers, or otherwise chose to leave an industry that forced them out, and patted ourselves on our backs for seriously asking how we could overcome this strange imbalance.

 > Not what a man has---knowledge, skill, or goods of life---determines his culture, but what a man is: culture is not so much mastery of things as mastery of self. And only that nation can be called cultured which adds to or, at least, broadens and deepens the spiritual assets of mankind...

You read that right.  In at least parts of the world, installing solar panels has become *cheaper* than paying electric bills.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How much energy does it take to get meat on your table?](https://www.futurity.org/energy-animal-products-food-3263722/) from Futurity

 > Rasul found that the energy efficiency of global food systems overall improved from 1995 to 2019, with the energy return on energy investment shifting from 0.68 in 1995 to 0.91 in 2019. Although that‚Äôs a clear improvement, it still meant that in 2019, ‚Äúfor every human-edible calorie provided to society, 10% more energy was needed to produce it,‚Äù Rasul and his colleagues write.

I have to admit that it actually surprised me to learn that parts of the world have greater-than-one efficiency at delivering calories to tables.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why and How to Hold John Roberts Accountable](https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/01/08/why-and-how-to-hold-john-roberts-accountable/) from Empty Wheel

 > But one of the only short-term guardrails on Trump will be the things the Senate and SCOTUS choose to place on him. They‚Äôve failed every other time they could reverse Trump‚Äôs damage, but in his first term, they did push back on his worst instincts. So by at least making the effects of the immunity ruling visible, you increase the chance that Roberts might do so.

I do hope that Democrats learn from getting blamed for literally everything that the Republicans do (for not fighting hard enough or not offering less-popular ideas or whatever) and start making the Republicans own every single destructive choice that they make, across the board.  Constantly ask Trump when he'll get prices to come down.  Constantly remind the public what enables the corruption that we all see.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Trump wants Greenland and Panama ‚Äì and the world must take it seriously](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/trump-buy-greenland-panama-us-neocon-war-on-terror/) from openDemocracy

 > To further this aim [of leading the world to a great new American century], the [Project for a New American Century](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/02/01/new-american-century-1997-2006-and-the-post-cold-war-neoconservative-moment/) was set up in 1997. It was seen by its supporters as rooted in US values and espousing market fundamentalism across the world in the true neoliberal mold. Moreover, this was just the right time, with the 2000 presidential election beginning to loom on the political horizon.

I'd bet that this crackpot Greenland idea comes from President Musk, by the way, not the puppet.  Greenland has deposits of the sorts of minerals and metals that you'd need to produce batteries, where China currently controls a lot of the market.  By contrast, Panama, Trump wants to bully because he has business before their courts.
