This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to Morrisa Jeanine's music.

![A person on a bench facing away from the other person and the scenery to look into the middle distance](/blog/assets/nature-outdoor-people-girl-woman-bench-1335874-pxhere.com.png "It doesn't look like the artist released the album covers under a public license, so you get a random thematic picture instead...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  Assorted songs
 * Location:  <https://www.tribeofnoise.com/mjeanine>
 * Released:  2014 -- 2020
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Morrisa Jeanine](https://www.morrisajeanine.com/)
 * Medium:  Music tracks
 * Length:  Approximately twenty-five minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Regressive gender roles, reference to a troubling celebrity romance

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Morrisa Jeanine

The artist provides the following background.

 > Morrisa Jeanine is an all arounder in entertainment whose music career publicly kicked off as a YouTube sensation back in 2006.  Coming from many girl groups the BMI singer-songwriter has made her wave as an individual in the music industry both by writing for upcoming acts and vocal producing and referencing the music.  In 2012, with the release of her first solo project, Morrisa Jeanine made a change by coming from behind-the-scenes songwriting to becoming one of many spotlighted artists.  Based out of Atlanta, GA, Morrisa Jeanine has been featured in many concert series and independent showcases.  With international success on her digital releases such as *Dirty Ol' Clothes*, *Out The Game*, *Real Simple* and most recently *Standing*.  Morrisa is soon scheduled to premiere a full debut album.

Tangentially, how have I not heard of [Tribe of Noise](https://www.tribeofnoise.com/) before now?  They bought the [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/) in 2019, and use CC BY-SA as their default license for uploads.  More importantly, every random track that I've picked to listen to sounds pretty good *and* has a fairly high level of production---most importantly for this sort of project, people actually sing[^1]---only lacking readable lyrics and better organization around albums.

[^1]:  I compare this to the likes of SoundCloud and Bandcamp, which both have plenty of Free Culture music, but they lean heavily towards the instrumental, especially electronic music, which I don't mind, but "experimental noise electronica drone chip-tune" doesn't really give us anything to start a conversation.

## What Works Well?

While certainly a matter of taste, I happen to love the musical aspects, here.  Sadly, I never had enough music education to have the language to *convey* what I like about it, but I suspect that a lot of readers will enjoy it.

Given that the artist doesn't work exclusively or primarily in Free Culture, I also greatly appreciate the "sampler" of their work, with the album titles giving some direction of where to explore next beyond what they offered here.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

One glaring problem, to me, comes from the...sameness.  A super-majority of songs tells stories of a lovelorn protagonist trying to convince their partner to make more of a commitment.  And one song goes so far as to talk about "never [having] it like" [Whitney Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston) and [Bobby Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Brown), which...look, I don't know how younger people see that relationship in retrospect, but given what we know about his infidelity and abuse, maybe not having it like that works out for the best?

## Opportunities

Continuing the aforementioned background information, Morrisa Jeanine says the following.

For someone getting their start on YouTube, it surprises me that the list doesn't *include* [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mzrissa).

Note that I didn't click through on any of them except for the artist's website.  Any of them may no longer work.

And you can buy various short albums.

## What's Adaptable?

Other than the aforementioned lovelorn protagonist, who also occasionally has an important project, I don't see anything other than the music itself.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read *Geiko Eien Ni --- Eternally Geisha*, a short story.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the music?
