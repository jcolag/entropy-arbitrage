Today marks the 109<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the start of the [Bread and Roses Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Lawrence_textile_strike), where textile workers protested a reduction in pay that came with a safety-oriented reduction in hours.  The Massachusetts National Guard decided that the appropriate response involved bayonets.

On the thirteenth, incidentally, those on the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar) also celebrate the new year.  ðŸŽŠ

Otherwise, to the code...

## Picture to Nonogram

We are getting closer to this being a functioning puzzle game.  I found [a way]() to reduce odd aspect ratios to something workable, added code to iterate over "blackness thresholds" to increase the chances of the puzzle being fun, and have started the work required to download a random image for processing.

I also made some minor changes to clean up the code, but those are far less interesting.

## Next

This week, I want to wrap up the download side and use the output to drive or generate a puzzle.
