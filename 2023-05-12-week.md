As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

While it has a lot of competition, the insistence that we need to "fix" how non-white people raise their children while leaving so many of our own to die from malnutrition or violence has to rank as at least *among* the most destructive policies.

This doesn't surprise me at all.  For all the hype, the more that I play with these machine learning systems, the more the results look like they haven't improved significantly over classical procedural algorithms, for understanding and generating content.  I like that the chat interface allows me (sometimes) to workshop an idea to get closer to what I wanted, but I still find myself doing most of the work, with the AI either providing the seed of an idea or serving as a "placebo assistant."

I keep saying that the reason that "the arc of the universe bends toward justice" has a lot to do with the effort that it takes to maintain unjust systems.  When a few people take a real stand against it, it tends to collapse.

I already knew most of this story, but this contextualizes it nicely, and not everybody has already read about it.  While I happen to not have any interest in drugs, seeing the background makes it difficult for me to support any prohibition.

Despite my vocal lack of excitement over machine learning above, I definitely appreciate that this hasn't ended up in the hands of a handful of wealthy corporations looking to destroy worker rights.  If they become useful, the democratization makes it far more likely that workers will use these products to save time, rather than have it replaced by a system that has trouble remembering what it said.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Thiel says that mothers are apt to sideline the "science" of economics for the soppy, sentimental idea that children shouldn't starve to death and thus vote for politicians who are willing to tax rich people.

I don't always enjoy Doctorow's blog, because he often has a coined term that he desperately hopes will become mainstream, will mostly tell a story that provides excuses to link to prior posts of his, or seem like he copied the article in after writing it somewhere else, due to the prominent explanation that you can also find the material in...the blog post that you can see in front of you.

However, this time, he gets at a bunch of interesting ideas, including some that I've talked about, like---in [my post on licenses]({% post_url 2019-12-28-licenses %}), and yes, I realize how crass that looks after calling out Doctorow for using his posts as excuses to link back to his own blog---how "the Tragedy of the Commons" came from a racist place intended to destroy cooperation.

While I don't have a *favorite* book, I find **Number 87** by [Eden Phillpotts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Phillpotts) (as "Harrington Hext") in 1922 an interesting candidate, for a number of reasons.  In it, a wealthy man named Bruce, due to oddities in his childhood, becomes obsessed with bats.  When, on a job, he discovers a powerful radioactive energy source, he becomes a vigilante known as The Bat.  Seriously, 1922.

Like a certain comic book character seventeen years in the future, this fellow creates a bat-like costume, signature vehicle, and signature weapons.  Unlike said future comic book character, he uses his weapons and persona (fursona?) he went on a global murder spree in hopes of wiping out the anti-science and fascist movements...OK, and trade unionists, for some reason.  He counted among his victim Judge Greanleaf P. Stubbs, an American presidential candidate on the Republican ticket who had the next election in the bag, despite his isolationist policies.  I can't say that I condone the protagonist's actions, but for two out of the three categories, after spending that past couple of years listening to Alito's constant whining...I get it, man.

Oh, and if any of that description sounds familiar, I toned (presumably an alternate-universe) Bruce down and stuffed he and his equipment into the background of the [*Silver Bat*]({% post_url 2019-12-14-seeking-refuge %}), giving the League part of its excuse for a bat theme.
