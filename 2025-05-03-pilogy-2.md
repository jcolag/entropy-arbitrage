This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **pilogy**, from _e^(8pi*i/5)_ to _1.011 Bella_.

![A collage of various images overlaid with the book's title in three rows of two letters, each in a different color](/blog/assets/pilogy.png "Well, that seems like a mess")

Before we get going, though, I want to briefly celebrate that yesterday marks five years of the Book Club {% emoji party popper %}.  After starting the blog, I had the vague idea of *occasionally* highlighting a Free Culture work, figuring that I'd quickly need to churn through the entire slate of [Blender Open Movies](https://studio.blender.org/films/) to fill time.  Instead, we've talked about something like (I've probably missed something) one collection of plays, two collections of children's books, three audio dramas, four poetry collections, six multi-episode shows, eight short stories, eight music albums, eight role-playing games or adventures, twelve story anthologies, eighteen films, twenty-two comics, thirty-one video games, and thirty-one novels or novellas, some overlapping categories---accidentally skipping only three weeks in the five years, because I inappropriately confused the release of a preservation platform for an old project with a public license for the underlying content---and we haven't yet needed to return to a prior creator's work.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **pilogy**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore>
 * Released:  2022 -- 2024 so far
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Anthony Wang and Isabella Wang
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately forty-one thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  More insensitive terminology, descriptions of methamphetamine manufacture, and murdering dissidents

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## pilogy

The Codeberg repository only really tells us this.

 > The fictional misadventures of the LHWHS Computer Science Club. Check out [pilogy](https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore/src/branch/main/pilogy.pdf)!

It also has the following probably tongue-in-cheek blurb, though.

 > *"I read the entire thing and I'm just gonna say this is better than any other fanfiction [sic] I've read."*
 >
 > *"How high were you when you wrote this?"*
 >
 > *"Bruh."*
 >
 > *"I didn't know books could cause epileptic seizures!"*
 >
 > Oh my gosh, can you believe it? My computer is overheating so much that the DVDs I'm burning with the chemtrails are actually catching on fire. I mean, talk about dedication to the cause. Not many people can say they've actually set their DVDs on fire while burning them.
 >
 > But honestly, I'm not surprised. I mean, I am a genius after all. I always push the limits and take things to the next level. And using chemtrails to burn DVDs? Genius. Absolute genius.
 >
 > But, you know, it's not just about being smart. It's about being stylish too. And let me tell you, these flames are definitely giving my setup a certain je ne sais quoi. It's like, oh yeah, I'm burning DVDs with chemtrails and my computer is so advanced it's literally on fire. No big deal.
 >
 > So yeah, read this book! It will make you laugh! It will make you cry! It will make you try the mayonnaise-frosted pie!

That might give somebody some idea of what to expect...maybe.

## What Works Well?

The humor has improved, and somehow become more topical, as Ezon Muzk commands the following.

 > You need to sabotage Mastodon: covertly introduce security bugs, figure out ways to overload the network, and unleash millions of bots onto Mastodon.  But this is only the first step in my glorious master plan. I’m planning on buy every other tech company in existence in order to achieve total tech dominance. Because who wouldn’t want to?

Granted, our world's probable and *alleged* inspiration for Muzk has grown more ambitious than buying out technology companies for petty reasons and moved to governments, but the point stands.

Sneaking in the fictional [computer science club's website](https://laduecs.club/) also seems like it'll gratify people.  In fact, while I didn't necessarily enjoy it, I should also give some attention to the attempt to work with different formats in this section of the book, and we could (almost) see the website as a part of that project.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Do you know what doesn't really help stream-of-conscious narratives that feel the need to burn our time on tangents?  Having the book criticize exactly that behavior in others.

 > You should focus on providing only relevant information to the plot and cutting out anything that does not move the story forward.

Instead of bringing us into the "joke," it shows that the author knows that it annoys readers, but thought that we'd maybe enjoy feeling annoyed.

## Opportunities

The repository, again, has this to say.

 > Love writing or world-building? Help out by expanding our collection of stories! We appreciate all contributions!

There you go.

## What's Adaptable?

The **Squirrelvatar: The Last Acornbender** cartoon, the **Morally “Question”able** anime game show (with a proprietary fictional host), the cryptobending, sarcabending, and teabending martial arts, the FroYo frozen yogurt shop, and the secret history of Kazakhstan all make appearances in this section.

## Coming Attractions

For the next few weeks, we'll continue reading **pilogy**, from _1.100 Lalani_ to the first quarter of the rather long _pi_.  If you reach the line “The one and only!” in *pi*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story so far?
