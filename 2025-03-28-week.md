As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I probably make this point often, but I can't help *not* notice how weak Republicans constantly act.  Even with control over all branches of government, even with what amounts to bottomless funding, and even when they can hand Democrats choices like giving Trump limited authority to shut things down and shutting everything down to let him decide what to keep, they still rush out sloppy work, stop to throw tantrums whenever anybody disagrees with them, and they sullenly back down at almost any resistance.

People don't act like that when they win.  People act like that when they know that they've built a house of cards and hope that nobody notices.

Feel free to insert your own snide mention of the Trump administration stripping the Department of Education for parts on your own time.

I feel like, if we've learned nothing else over the last few decades, we *should* have all learned that you can't compromise with the political right.  Compromise, and it shifts the Overton Window, giving them permission to scurry even further to the right.  Sometimes it backfires on them, such as when gay people tried to compromise with their objections to marriage equality by offering to accept civil unions, only for them to reject that with such ferocity that it exposed their position as nothing more than unsupportable hatred.  But you can't *rely* on people deciding to care.

I assume that the same gap holds true for most cities.  I mean, you can't exactly say that history has put much effort into giving Black folks credit...

Well, if you can't go on offense forty or fifty years ago, this will also work as "the time," but seriously, we needed to start *long* before Republicans openly worked to upend state legislatures so that they could redraw district maps...

 > Woman was not wanting in courage in the early ages. In war and bloodshed this trait was often displayed. Grecian and Roman history have lauded and honored her in this character. English history records her courageous women too, for unhappily we have little but the records of war handed down to us.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw Trump mention %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [As Trump looks to privatize USPS, its workers fight for a contract](https://therealnews.com/as-trump-looks-to-privatize-usps-its-workers-fight-for-a-contract) from The Real News Network

 > The NALC is a national association of letter carriers. Weâ€™ve existed since the 1890s. We didnâ€™t have collective bargaining rights with the post office until after the great postal strike of 1970 largest wildcat strike in US history. And at that point too, thatâ€™s when they moved the post office out of the cabinet and into its own organization.

It does seem a bit unwise to mess with the Post Office.  They have far more experience than almost anybody at organizing and mobilizing, both because of its responsibilities and its history.

 > Japan's willingness to host the first high-level economic dialogue with Beijing in six years speaks volumes. Japanese leadership has recognized that it cannot afford to maintain distance from Beijing at a time when American reliability has evaporated, and America is throwing its allies - from Canada to Ukraine - under the bus.

I hate using words like "treason," but while we can and should definitely have a conversation about the position of the United States on the world stage, a White House deliberately making moves that reduce and eliminate that authority doesn't seem like it should play at all well to the flag-hugging weirdos.
