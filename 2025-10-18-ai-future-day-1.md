This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **AI Future Day**...assuming that the author actually calls it that.

![A young person sitting on a sidewalk to use a smartphone](/blog/assets/35168590506_48d03d0a39_o.png "Part of me wanted to find one of the kids-texting-each-other-from-the-same-couch pictures, but decided against it...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **AI Future Day**
 * Location:  <https://www.osugisakae.com/blog/ai-future-day-01.html>
 * Released:  2023 -- 2024
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Chris Spackman](https://www.osugisakae.com/index.html)
 * Medium:  Novella
 * Length:  Approximately twenty-one thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Profuse coarse language and ableist terminology, popular culture references

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## AI Future Day

I can't find much about the story except repeated references to it on the main page as...

> ...the "future of AI in school" science-fiction short story.

Beyond that, you know what I know.  However, I suppose that this brief summary gives us some idea of the shape of things, since we've all started living in that world.

## What Works Well?

The teen 'tude, about which more later, vaguely pays off when the story turns (briefly) towards racism.  Likewise, the discussion of inequality almost works.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Starting the story with the protagonist screaming for three paragraphs about the horrors of going to a run-down public school instead of using family wealth to buy their way into a cushy private school makes a definite choice.  He also doesn't approve of teachers.  And somehow, no other character appears to see if the run-down municipal building will fit in the protagonist's large intestines.

Speaking of the protagonist's complaints, we also can't seem to decide which AIs work well and which don't.  Open source AIs stink, apparently, but proprietary AIs stink, and even though the AIs stink, the protagonist's does a pretty good job (they tell us) and everybody *else* has a bad one.

Mostly, though, I find this tiring.  I don't see any story coming together.  The protagonist doesn't have much of a personality beyond profanity and popular culture references[^U-0eXM].  The AI with a female African name comes off like a "sassy" slave.  And the "banter" drags on endlessly while feeling like filler.

[^U-0eXM]:  Taste might have a lot to do with this.  Some people will undoubtedly find 1980s comedies and similar "geek culture" endearing.

## Opportunities

I don't see any interest in support or engagement, though the author has written quite a few other things.

## What's Adaptable?

The journal entries introduce St. Abdi Public High School (and seemingly St. Abdi), the OpenAfrica open source AI company, and the handful of characters and their AIs.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll wrap up reading **AI Future Day**, the final three "days" of the journal.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story so far?
