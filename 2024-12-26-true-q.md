## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## True Q

Let's jump right in.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46192.3. We have arrived at Starbase one-one=two and are loading relief supplies destined for Tagra Four, an ecologically devastated planet in the Argolis Cluster. We have also taken on a rather unusual passenger.

As it turns out, we last checked out the Argolis Cluster in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}).  Given that Q introduced us to the Borg in [*Q Who?*]({% post_url 2023-03-09-q-who %}), that seems like an odd coincidence.

 > **ROGERS**: Thank you, sir.

You might recognize Rogers as [Olivia d'Abo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_d%27Abo), then getting near the end of her run as the sister on [**The Wonder Years**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonder_Years).

 > **PICARD**: And congratulations. I understand that you were selected for this internship out of hundreds of applicants.

Despite her age, Crusher's presence made me think that she had a [*medical* internship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship_%28medicine%29), a sort of---actual medical people, please correct me on this---personalized post-graduate study required for licensing.  I gather that the term no longer officially exists in the United States since the mid-1970s, preferring to refer to it directly as post-graduate work, but even fifty years later, most people know the process/position by the older name.

Anyway, despite the sense that would make, we'll later see Rogers drift to other departments, meaning that this looks more like broader corporate internships, inspired by the medical position, where a student does low-status work for the company in exchange for the work experience.  Traditionally, many companies have treated this latter form of internship as bartering, where the student provides labor in exchange for the experience, chance to grow their professional network, and a more extensive work history.

However, that arrangement has (unsurprisingly) often led to poor treatment of the intern, with the classic example of having them take calls and get coffee for abusive colleagues.  Even where the intern gets a valuable experience, the lack of or lower monetary payment usually means that only the already-wealthy can afford to commute to and participate in an internship, making it a tool to widen inequality instead of narrowing it.  A few years ago, a few high-profile incidents, particularly the [**Black Swan** interns suing](https://otherwords.org/illegal_interns/) that exposed Hollywood's reliance on unpaid labor, led the Department of Labor to update their [definitions and policies on internships](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) to clarify that, if the employer benefits from the relationship more than the intern, then the intern must get paid a normal wage for their labor.

I go through all this to point out that, the cast and crew at the time almost certainly saw this internship as putting a young civilian on a military or military-like craft to get put in harm's way on a weekly basis---from the lecherous nature of her colleagues, if not flying directly into a literal battlefield---probably for no compensation unless she happens to land a mentor who'll actually teach her something useful.

 > **PICARD**: Or at least what fields you're not interested in.

Did he actually imply that she'll find work on the ship boring?  Remember, in [*Relics*]({% post_url 2024-12-12-relics %}), he talked about how he'd much rather run back to the *Stargazer*, so he might well have burned out sometime during all the refusals to go to therapy for his debilitating trauma in [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-10-26-both-worlds-1 %}).  I doubt that the writers *intended* that interpretation, but it'd make a lot more sense than telling a high school graduate that her experience will teach her ways to feel unfulfilled.

 > **RIKER**: It's all yours.

He works so hard at trying to make this a legitimate-sounding conversation, and it never happens as he loiters in the room of a young woman for no actual reason other than the script needs to set up a later conflict...

 > **ROGERS**: So I should scan myself with each one to make sure all the readouts are working?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Any unit that doesn't, put it aside, and we'll do a diagnostic on it later.

Three things from this quick exchange.

First, they don't replicate the tricorders on demand.  They can make food and---as we learned in [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %})---gifts and who knows what else, but apparently not devices that they need on a regular basis.

Then, notice that manufactured goods have defects that users can't determine until they receive the things.  They can make it out of the manufacturing facility without working properly.  The shipping container doesn't run diagnostics.  They don't diagnose themselves.  A human needs to scan something to determine if it works.

Finally and related to the previous item, they don't have a better way to test anything other than to manually use it and diagnose problems.  They can't remotely set them all to scan simultaneously, compare their results with the sensors already in sickbay, and report the deviations, for example.  Fingers need to touch the buttons, and eyes need to look at the screens.

 > **ROGERS**: It's amazing to think that they go to such lengths to clean the air instead of regulating the emissions that cause the problem.

Wouldn't *you* like to live in a world where that amazed you?  Actually, in our world, it'd probably amaze us that people went to the trouble of cleaning up...

 > **DATA**: Imagination is not necessary. The scale is readily quantifiable. We are presently generating twelve point seven five billion gigawatts per---

Data has behaved fairly well for a while, and who triggers his "let me show you how much smarter I consider myself" reflex but a young civilian woman trapped with them for the duration.  That sort of reinforces my assertion above about the nature of this internship, where Data apparently wants to make it clear that she has a much lower status.

 > **RIKER**: You said she was adopted. Could she be an alien?

What purpose does this question serve?  Either Riker read the script, or he wants to express his deep paranoia that the intern doesn't belong on the crew, much like Data trying to shut down her excitement.

 > **Q**: Well, there, that's better. Crusher gets more shrill with each passing year.

And Picard has no reaction to this blatantly sexist nonsense.

 > **ROGERS**: It just seems so complicated now. These powers that I have are just going to stand in the way. I don't want to have to deal with it.

We've noted before that immigrants to the Federation seem to face a traumatic amount of discrimination, and here, the kid seems to suggest that displaying new abilities will cause similar problems.

 > **Q**: I think you've missed the point, my dear. Clearly, you've spent far too much time with humans. As a Q, you can have your heart's desire, instantly, whatever that may be. Would you like precious jewels? Works of art? Would you like to walk along the rings of Tautine?

Not relevant for us, but this list seems awfully...petty, no?  He has the power to reshape the universe, and he comes up with larceny as his first and second examples of what to do.

 > **PICARD**: Send us your design specifications. I'm sure we'll be able to help.

I should note that we train many professionals---most famously, doctors and police---to *never* make promises like this, because it builds up hopes when you might not actually have the ability to solve the problem.  It seems worth pointing this out, because while nobody bothers to mention it, we'll find out in the final act that they haven't helped at all, probably putting lives at risk with their calm assurances that they can help.

 > **DATA**: I have some information regarding Amanda Rogers' parents. Records indicate that they died in Topeka, Kansas. Their home was destroyed during a tornado.

Heh.  Kansas, part of [Tornado Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley), has [plenty of tornadoes](https://www.weather.gov/ict/kstorfacts), with 1991, the year before this aired, seeing almost a hundred twenty of the things, a dozen of them EF3 or greater.  However, add in the magic-like power of the Q, and I imagine that they actually meant this to reference [**The Wonderful Wizard of Oz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz) or, more likely, 1939's [**The Wizard of Oz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz) cinematic adaptation, because they love the 1930s so much...

 > **PICARD**: A tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the weather modification net?

We've noted before, most recently in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-07-time-s-arrow-1 %}) that at least Earth seems to (still?) see nature as something to conquer and subjugate, rather than trying to live in harmony with the world.

 > **Q**: I think you are. How repulsive. How do you stand that hair all over his face?

Does that even rank as one of the top *ten* reasons to find Riker repulsive...?

 > **RIKER**: No. You can't just snatch people and put them in your fantasies and expect them to respond.

Also, they have the gaping age difference, and circumstances have made her emotionally vulnerable, and...yeah, he apparently won't care about any of those parts.

 > **PICARD**: Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we first encountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity.
 >
 > **Q**: The jury is still out on that, Picard, make no mistake.

Picard refers to [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), while Q...well, I suppose that we'll get there eventually.  You know what they say about (ahem) *All Good Things*.

Also, it occurs to me that, while nobody ever comments on it as far as I can remember, that whole trial idea feels suspiciously like what we saw of first contact policies in, well, [*First Contact*]({% post_url 2024-02-15-first-contact %}).  In that episode, we found out that the Federation spies on and tries to manipulate cultures about to reach into space, in hopes of making them friendlier to Federation interests and possibly sabotaging those cultures that they see as troublesome.

Q, at least, has the decency to tell them about the trial...

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, see if there's any way we can do to cut through the interference and beam them out of there.

Couldn't they have provided power, instead?  Letting it get this bad---especially after assuring them that they can absolutely help---and then yanking their people out feels like it doesn't exactly fit with Picard's big, stirring speech about morality...

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we learn more about the Q than the Federation, but some items still slip through.

### The Good

They find it shocking that a society would opt to clean pollution instead of limiting the production of pollution in the first place.

### The Bad

The Federation *might* engage in questionable employment practices.  We don't get enough information to say for sure, but they do seem to imply it.

We see a return to the uncomfortable obsession with trying to show superiority to or paranoia toward colleagues, when faced with a new colleague.  And they continue to not defend women against sexist comments made in private, while we get a suggestion that humans who develop alien abilities have extra difficulty in their lives.

Picard suggests that Starfleet has little problem making promises to people without evidence that they can fulfill those promises, and look for ways to escape when they fail.

Earth also continues to see the natural world as an inconvenience to tame and exploit.

Riker, as usual, awkwardly runs when romantically pursued.  He doesn't seem to object to the age, power difference, or emotional vulnerability, only that he had a different date in mind and didn't initiate the pursuit.

### The Weird

Picard seems to think that people would find working on the *Enterprise* boring.

The Federation appears to use centralized manufacturing for its technical equipment, with little enough quality assurance for end users to not want to trust the results.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in the new year, when we waste three guest stars on a framing device to give Picard some hair and show us more terrible user interface design, in *Rascals*.
