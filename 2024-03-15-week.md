As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > All of these get-rich-quick with low-effort AI video influencers are actually just advertising their own Discord channels, where they sell courses, resources, and coaching sessions on how to go viral.

Hashtags:  #SocialMedia #AI #Scams

I should note that I didn't decide to share this article to dump on TikTok.  The scammers go there because *people* go there.  When other networks gain traction, similar systems will show up there, too.  And this goes back *forever*, too.  Back in the early 2000s, when "content marketing" started to become an actual phrase that serious people used, almost every product in the space gave a few personal anecdotes about how the author rakes in money, followed by ways to up-sell yourself on more of their products.

When someone insisted that I watch the adaptation of [**The Secret**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_%28Byrne_book%29) with them, I laughed throughout most of it.  I couldn't tell you anything about the book, but the filmed version included a constant stream of ponderous testimonials from those exact content marketing "experts"---infamous names on the Internet---talking about how they wished for some high-priced item, but didn't have the money.  As a result, they carefully vision-boarded their desires, to "attract" the money that they wanted.

...And then they sent off an e-mail to their mailing list of ~~tens of thousands of gullible suckers~~ followers advertising a new remix of their existing e-books.  And sure enough, the money showed up like *magic*.

 > Peace is possible the moment that each side would accept what the other would grant, but from the international or human point of view a satisfactory peace is possible only when these claims and concessions are such as to forward and not to hinder human progress.

Hashtags:  #USPol #GOP #Taxes #TaxCutAndJobsAct

You might almost feel left to think that legislating based on discredited economic theories, which have failed every time that someone has acted on them except to the extent that it helped the wealthy to become wealthier, but Republicans will continue to push the idea.  The "except" part of the previous sentence explains why.

 > For workers to go back with a class-conscious spirit, with an organized and a determined attitude toward society means that even if they have made no economic gain they have the possibility of gaining in the future. In other words, a labor victory must be economic must be revolutionizing. Otherwise, it is not complete.

Honestly, I can't imagine the Falwell family operating their institution any other way.  Whenever bigoted people like that use the term "liberty," especially in connection with religion, they mean the liberty of people like them to ignore consequences for their actions.

 > To meet our basic needs, a household with two adults and two children needs to earn over $23 an hour. But Georgia‚Äôs minimum wage is just $7.25.

Hashtags:  #SNAP #SocialSafetyNet

When I think about the stagnant minimum wage, I contextualize it by remembering that my college paid me $7.25 or so for peer tutoring in the mid-1990s.  At the time, I didn't really have expenses, since I took out a student loan (after a full scholarship covering classes) to pay for on-campus housing, including a meal plan with the cafeteria.  Expecting adults *with* expenses to survive on that kind of money doesn't make any sense.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
