This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Cairn**, focusing on *About the Example Party* to *Growth*.

![The book's cover, with a script-like title over thorny vegetation, with small hands poking up near the bottom of the image](/blog/assets/cairn.png "Not the most exciting beginning, but we'll see...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Cairn**, Warden's Guide
 * Location:  <https://cairnrpg.com/>
 * Released:  2021 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com)
 * Medium:  Role-Playing Game
 * Length:  Approximately seventy thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Cairn, Warden Guide

The game's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn) has the following to say.

 > Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). There are two editions (see sidebar) both of which are rules-compatible.

The game also lists the following principles, which might give a clearer idea of how to interpret things.

 > ### Neutrality
 >
 > The Warden's role is to act as a neutral arbiter and portray the rules, situations, non-player characters (NPCs), and narrative clearly.
 >
 > ### Classless
 >
 > A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, and their experiences define their specialty.
 >
 > ### Death
 >
 > Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.
 >
 > ### Fiction First
 >
 > Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are based on in-world elements and arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players.
 >
 > ### Growth
 >
 > Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
 >
 > ### Player Choice
 >
 > Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.
 >
 > ### Principles
 >
 > The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.
 >
 > ### Shared Objectives
 >
 > Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

It continues on that way, but you get the general idea.

## What Works Well?

Probably the big headline, here, comes from the start of the [*Growth*](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/growth/) section.

 > Unlike other role-playing games, Cairn does not reward player characters for killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, it is a character’s unique experience in the game world that has the potential to alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

We have too many games of all sorts that reward violence.  And while I don't think that playing violent games causes violence, I do think that such a unified vision of the world has long-term effects on how we think about problem-solving.  Here, growth comes from...learning and the occasional rite of passage, a lot like it does in our world.

Also, the example in [*Combat*](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/wardens-guide/combat/) and a couple of other sections finally flesh out the world in small ways.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Other than the brief examples mentioned in the previous section, the world still feels more like a bare-bones idea for a setting than a place that people would actually inhabit.  It goes as far as to provide rules to randomly generate regions to explore, ensuring that no two gaming groups will see similar versions of Vald.

## Opportunities

The aforementioned repository says the following.

 > This is a game that values community contributions! If you'd like to submit an adventure, hack, monster, or conversion take a look at the [submission guide](https://cairnrpg.com/submissions/submission-guide/).

I won't bother to quote their page on the topic...

## What's Adaptable?

The rules in this section give an idea---through random generation rules, as mentioned earlier---of the variety in creatures, forests, and dungeons.  As mentioned, examples also at least gesture at the Ursine Conclave, Ein Eyton temple, sample characters Wolfram, Lucius, and Freya, and occasional other odds and ends.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up reading **Cairn**, specifically the Wardens Guide *Knowledge and Perception* to the end.  Note that we'll (as usual) ignore most of the mechanics, unless something sticks out as especially interesting.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game's world so far?
