This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **pilogy**, from the start to _e^(6pi*i/5)_.

![A collage of various images overlaid with the book's title in three rows of two letters, each in a different color](/blog/assets/pilogy.png "Well, that seems like a mess")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **pilogy**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore>
 * Released:  2022 -- 2024, so far
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Anthony Wang and Isabella Wang
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately forty-one thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Tired old "flame war" arguments, ableist terminology, some violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## pilogy

The Codeberg repository only really tells us this.

 > The fictional misadventures of the LHWHS Computer Science Club. Check out [pilogy](https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore/src/branch/main/pilogy.pdf)!

It also has the following probably tongue-in-cheek blurb, though.

 > *"I read the entire thing and I'm just gonna say this is better than any other fanfiction [sic] I've read."*
 >
 > *"How high were you when you wrote this?"*
 >
 > *"Bruh."*
 >
 > *"I didn't know books could cause epileptic seizures!"*
 >
 > Oh my gosh, can you believe it? My computer is overheating so much that the DVDs I'm burning with the chemtrails are actually catching on fire. I mean, talk about dedication to the cause. Not many people can say they've actually set their DVDs on fire while burning them.
 >
 > But honestly, I'm not surprised. I mean, I am a genius after all. I always push the limits and take things to the next level. And using chemtrails to burn DVDs? Genius. Absolute genius.
 >
 > But, you know, it's not just about being smart. It's about being stylish too. And let me tell you, these flames are definitely giving my setup a certain je ne sais quoi. It's like, oh yeah, I'm burning DVDs with chemtrails and my computer is so advanced it's literally on fire. No big deal.
 >
 > So yeah, read this book! It will make you laugh! It will make you cry! It will make you try the mayonnaise-frosted pie!

That might give somebody some idea of what to expect...maybe.

## What Works Well?

Erring on the side of politeness, the book has a consistent sense of humor.  Its humor, to my chagrin, doesn't overlap at all with mine, but I do recognize the jokes, and that many people *do* have senses of humor that overlap with this.  OK, not entirely, the cryptocurrency bit at the start of chapter _e^(2pi*i/5)_ did amuse me.

Despite a rough start, the book also has at least decent pacing.  The events escalate smoothly, and---a pure coincidence, I imagine, since I broke up the book arbitrarily---this section ends with a fairly impressive "cliffhanger."

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The characters don't feel like they have any depth to them, often seeming like they come from thirty-year-old USENET transcripts.

And while I did call out the sense of humor before, I also need to point out that you had better get to like those jokes, because you'll see a surprising number of them recycled in the text.  With a lighter touch, we might call them clever callbacks, but on the fourth or fifth near-verbatim iteration of the time that the awful protagonist got a virus from pasting a YouTube comment into a PowerShell script, that seems vanishingly likely.

## Opportunities

The repository, again, has this to say.

 > Love writing or world-building? Help out by expanding our collection of stories! We appreciate all contributions!

There you go.

## What's Adaptable?

While some of this has proprietary trademarks interwoven, this section of the book introduces LHWHS Horton hears a Who High School, the "Misery" Institute of Technology, weird billionaire Ezon Muzk and his niece Jazelle, with Muzk Tower in San Silicono, and [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) tea shop, that I noticed.

## Coming Attractions

For the next few weeks, we'll continue reading **pilogy**, from _e^(8pi*i/5)_ to _1.011 Bella_.  If you reach _1.100 Lalani_, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story so far?
