This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **Konqi**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Konqi**
 * Location:  <https://community.kde.org/Konqi>
 * Released:  2017 --
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  [Tysontan](https://community.kde.org/User:Tysontan) and editors
 * Medium:  Short story
 * Length:  Approximately nine hundred words
 * Content Advisories:  Sexism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Konqi

The page describes itself as follows.

> **Konqi** is the mascot of [KDE](http://Kde.org), a cheerful green dragon. He and his colorful dragon friends live in KDEvalley, Flossland. This page tells the story about him and his friends.

And this from its footnote.

> Obviously, the story here is fictional, and the intention is to bring some charm and laughter to the community.

You might also want to know this bit from the footnotes.

> Konqi was named after Konqueror, KDE's default web browser, which was also at the time KDE's default file manager.

And now you know pretty much what I do.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I do want to mention that I rarely use [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE), myself.  I appreciate the work that goes into it, though, and the fact that they celebrated their [twenty-ninth anniversary last month](https://community.kde.org/29th_birthday) made a fairly good occasion to run this.

## What Works Well?

I appreciate the sentiment that all Free Software projects have their own community of dragons making things work.  Similarly, the discussion of the dragon antlers at least tries to make the point that all sorts of contributions have value, rather than the awful old view that only code really matters.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Oddly for such a short piece, this has odd large-scale editing problems, such as the KDE Dragons deciding to call themselves...KDE Dragons.

Also, the page introduces us to Katie as Konqi's girlfriend, but also maybe more a little sister, and also she does all the emotional labor.  And, I don't know, maybe the project didn't actually need *every* misogynist stereotype packed into a single character.  And then they compound it by assuring us that Konqi "is" a list of good qualities, whereas Katie "seems to be" a similar list[^LIEg37].

[^LIEg37]:  Not to belabor the point, but this seems especially galling, considering that Katie serves as the mascot for the KDE community women's group, and so seems to dismiss them in exactly the ways that projects have dismissed women and people from other disadvantaged groups.

## Opportunities

Specifically with this story, it looks like anybody with access to the wiki could update it.

More broadly, KDE has a page on [getting involved in the project](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved) with a variety of means of contacting people and ways to contribute, with [donations](https://kde.org/donate/) requiring the least commitment or technical training.

## What's Adaptable?

While I don't know how useful anybody would find them outside this particular story, we do get Flossland, Proprietaryland, Userland, the Belief Ocean, the Professional Ocean, KDEvalley, Kandalf the developer, 

## Coming Attractions

Next up, we'll read the material for the *Aether Galaxy* setting, probably splitting the reading over three weeks, starting with the first half-ish of the **Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook**, from *Life in the Galaxy* to *Galactic Regions*.  If you pass the *Gazetteer*, then you've gone too far.

{% include fchelp.md %}

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story?
