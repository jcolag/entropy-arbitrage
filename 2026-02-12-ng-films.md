## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Next Generation Films (and Debris) Summary

I don't think that I have anything particularly interesting to say about this batch, so let's jump right in...

## Conclusions

As I did with the original cast seasons, unlike the discussions of individual episodes, I'll skip the judgment calls and instead break everything down by field of practice.

Before we get moving, as usual, I feel it worth a reminder that *Star Trek* doesn't show our future.  We see deviations in the timeline, especially when the writers try to predict their futures.  I won't collect them---many people have picked apart the franchise timeline and decided how to resolve the contradictions, including the studio itself---but I wanted to make that point clear early.

### Training and Professionalism

People don't seem to understand that they can leave their pretend vehicles unattended[^G2].

They don't seem to pay attention to their actual work[^F1] [^N1], however.  They also don't seem capable of forming or following a plan[^F2] [^I1] [^N1] or maintain usable records[^I1].  Many don't seem to understand how to prioritize news[^N1], nor do they value the time of colleagues[^N2].  They also find it shocking that different people know different things based on their experiences, or that different sorts of people might have similar jobs[^V].

The authoritarian streak continues.  People with institutional authority see themselves as moral leaders[^G3] and having command over civilian life[^G3].  People can also claim to have authority and get people to follow[^F1], and people will follow even self-destructive orders without question[^F2], and people feel the need to praise their leaders[^N1] and protecting their egos[^N2].  Those with authority likewise seem to believe that nobody has the right to question them[^F2], and can defy orders on any pretext[^F1] [^I1], with orders seemingly altered retroactively to fit what they did[^N1].

They seem to recognize the authoritarianism, but only speak about it in hushed tones away from their superiors[^V].

Workers with status believe that they shouldn't need to do work that doesn't interest them[^F1].

### Economics

We see strong hints of inequality, with some coming from wealth[^G2], especially in Starfleet[^G3].  Those with lower status also read as their lives having less value to society[^F2].  And the Federation carefully weighs the likely returns on salvaging a ship[^G3].

Starfleet, at least, allows people to roll over unused vacation days[^I2].  They also seem to permit officers to commandeer important ships for personal travel[^N1].

### Science and Technology

The concerns about warp drive destroying the fabric of space seem long forgotten[^F1].

Automatic doors have become so common that some people no longer remember how to manually open a door[^V].

#### Design

Systems only have safety limits imposed optionally, with little effort required to turn almost any technology deadly[^F1].

#### Health Care

Starfleet seems to want to supply cosmetic surgery for all[^I1].  However, they still treat therapy as a joke[^I1] [^V].

#### Academia

People seem to believe that they have a right to experience history in tactile ways[^F1], not paying attention to such lessons otherwise[^F1].  The latter seems to also apply to other fields[^F1] [^F2].  They especially seem to see cultural sites as open to claim[^I1].

They also see interest in an academic field as grounds for mockery[^F1].  And people see scientific projects as well beneath their station[^I1].

We see bans on theoretical physical phenomena, because if real, they might present a danger[^N1].

At least some forms of technical education seem to focus attention on the personalities behind inventions[^F2].

Students can't distinguish between their classes and the textbooks for those classes[^F2].

#### Food and Drink

They still treat Romulan Ale as a controlled substance[^N1].

At least some people don't like the idea of eating unpeeled root vegetables[^V].

### Government, Law, and Corrections

People apparently see service in Starfleet as inherently important[^G2].

The Prime Directive might involve not rescuing historical figures attacked by other time travelers[^F1].  When the Prime Directive means not interfering with cultures, they frame it in metaphysical ideas of a culture's purpose[^I1], but also find reasons to dismiss it[^I1], including that it would inconvenience a government project[^I1].  The Federation government even sees ethnic cleansing as appropriate, if it provides access to valuable resources[^I2].

The Federation's government seems to have a habit of backing off unethical projects to return to them when scrutiny dies down[^I2].

Even people wielding some influence seem to believe that they most strongly influence policy by sending the equivalent of a rare strongly worded e-mail[^I2].

Many identify Earth with the Federation, seeing the rest of it as little more than support[^N2].

### Religion

They (still) seem to believe that life has no meaning without an ending[^G3].

We see Christmas celebrations, which have taken on a Victorian style again[^G3].  And at least some continue to show a superficial flirtation with Christianity[^N2].

### Family

People seem to think that a child sharing their interests gives them a claim to the child's time[^G2].

#### Gender Roles

They seem to judge cultures by the opportunities to treat women like sex objects[^G2] [^N2] [^V].

Professional women also appear to get randomly assigned childcare duties[^G3] or helping important men dress themselves[^I1] or other menial chores[^V], rather than their actual jobs.

We also see men talking over women, then repeating their ideas as their own[^F2].  Likewise, many men seem to rush to speak condescendingly to women who they find attractive[^I1].  In marriage, they expect men to have power in the relationship, while women become an appendage to it, laughing about the possibility of that changing someday[^N1].  Men also treat women like their property to defend[^N1] and control[^V].

People---and computers, suggesting an official policy---see no problems with speculating about and discussing a woman's sexual behavior[^V].

While women's artistic hobbies have previously resulted in decades of mockery, men have the same hobbies doesn't provoke more attention than a quick eye-roll[^I1].

#### Sex

We see some fairly awkward sex[^N1].

#### Race Relations and Nationalism

Non-humans appear to have a harder time advancing their careers[^G2], and authority figures subject them to mockery[^G2] [^F1] [^I1] [^I2] [^N2], sometimes even unnecessarily sending them into dangerous situations[^F2] and bringing them on missions seemingly for the purposes of insulting them[^I1].  They find it intolerable, though, for a non-human to tease a human[^G2] or target them with similar microaggressions[^N1].  The targets occasionally push back[^F2], showing that they don't invite the behavior, and suggest that they see the exploitation[^I1] [^I2].  And at least androids still don't have secure civil rights[^I1].

They continue to perpetuate, maybe even demand, ethnic stereotypes, such as androids wasting everybody's time[^G2] or refusing to acknowledge their emotions[^I2].  And people from such backgrounds feel a strong expectation that they'll explain their existence when meeting somebody new[^F2], and tread carefully to avoid people seeing them as threats[^I2].

To at least some, all non-human life falls into the same foreign category[^F2], with their diets and customs considered ridiculous and not worth the effort of observing[^I1].  And they believe that everybody should aspire to acting more human[^N2], or at least grow in ways that the Federation endorses[^N2].

Grudgingly, and only when they can view it as a prospective underdog story, they recognize ethnic cleansing as offensive and dangerous[^I1].

#### International Relations

People continue to see diabolical Romulan plots behind all sorts of issues[^G2] [^F1] [^I1] [^N1], even with evidence to the contrary[^G2] [^N1].  At times, they do admit that the fears have no basis[^F1].  The Borg have also gotten upgraded to a perpetual enemy[^I1].

They also see value in the slaughter of opponents like the Borg and anybody who came in contact with them[^F1].

Humans still seem to loathe the idea of a non-human having some power or advantage over them[^N1].

Many reject diplomacy as not worth the effort[^I1], sending belligerents to lead task forces[^N2], and don't see the loss of the lives of foreigners as troubling[^I2].  Notably, it takes a strong feeling of rebelliousness from their culture to extend empathy to foreigners[^I2], though only if they can see themselves as protagonists of the story[^I2].  They can also extend empathy to foreigners when it means condemning the liberation of a lower class[^N1].

Outsiders see the Federation as standing on the verge of collapse[^I2], and that the government chases polling numbers over standing on principles[^I2].

We see more than a bit of evidence that the Federation either outright destroyed the Romulan home-world or allowed an exploding star to destroy it, and possibly risked the entire galaxy in the process[^2].

### Popular Culture

We see a firm rejection of music that became popular after 1939[^F2] [^N1].

At least some people use old military logs as adventure games, believing that they will provide insight into personal problems[^V].

#### Socialization

We see a strong preference for pre-industrial Earth, despite the lack of medical treatment that would keep many of them alive and massive inequality that would bar many of them from pursuing their interests[^G2].  They also don't see much value in the lives of at least the lower classes[^F2].

People still have trouble expressing or dealing with grief[^G2] [^V].  And at times, they don't seem to have much emotional regulation at all, seeing mild fear a bigger threat than imprisonment[^I1].  They can, however, briefly acknowledge grief when a close friend dies[^N2].

Yet they jump to commit violence[^N1] [^N2], possibly even planning mass violence[^N2], celebrating killing in self-defense as a joyous occasion[^G3] [^F2] [^I2] [^N2], and see few problems with maliciously killing people who they've rendered incapable of further harm[^F2].  They also see violence as a high-status activity[^F1], treating life as low-value[^F1].  They condemn violence in the service of liberating the oppressed, though[^N1].

And they also equate safety with cowardice[^F2].  Maybe related, we see that insecurity around body image looms large in people's minds[^N1].

Many seem to believe that celebrities, even those in the midst of a crisis, owe fans their time and attention[^F2].  That includes manipulating or abducting them for some greater good[^F2].

And we see a firm belief that personal loyalty and social class supersede all other concerns[^F2] [^I2] [^V], loyalty even dominating strong artificial feelings of rebelliousness[^I2].  Even when "publicizing" wrongdoing in an emergency, they only do so by following the chain of command[^I1].

They also show a craving for dominance over colleagues[^I1].

People in the Federation seem to widely share a belief that they live in a perfected utopia with no internal problems[^F1] [^F2], and only need to state their principles loudly to fix any lapses[^I2].

#### Fashion

People still haven't discovered tailored clothing[^I1].

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we wrap up **The Next Generation**...well, except for a handful of characters' appearances on other shows.  Then, in two weeks (the twenty-sixth), we'll finally start **Deep Space Nine** with the first half of *Emissary*, though I suppose that---in a way---we have *always* watched it.
