## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Birthright part 2

After a *previously...* segment, this picks up where we left off, Worf captured by the prisoners.

 > **L'KOR**: The Romulans hoped to trade our lives for territorial concessions, but the Klingon High Council refused to negotiate. They would not acknowledge that their warriors had been taken prisoner.

This gives some indication of the international politics, and how this big enmity works, though it probably doesn't do much for us.

By the way, I didn't mention it last time, for some reason, but you might actually recognize L'Kor as [Richard Herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Herd), who has showed up almost everywhere, over the years, later including a recurring spot on **Voyager** that he continued into fan-produced media (before Paramount created strict rules against hiring known actors in such productions), and some video game work.

 > **WORF**: If he had been captured as you were, if I had found him here, I would be glad to see him. There is no room in my heart for shame.

The Klingon has grown a lot over the years, no?

 > **L'KOR**: I can only hope that if my son came here, he would be Klingon enough to kill me.

We...all think that Mogh disguised his identity as L'Kor, right?  The character doesn't feel like he makes any sense in context without that idea.

 > **WORF**: Have your parents taught you nothing? This is used for battle, not tilling soil.

OK, maybe Worf hasn't grown *that* much...

 > **WORF**: Kahless looked into the sea and wept, for the sword is all he had left of his father. The ocean filled with his tears and flooded beyond the shore.
 >
 > **TOQ**: That is impossible!
 >
 > **WORF**: For you, perhaps. Not Kahless. He was a great warrior.

Klingon warriors, you see, can cry much more than anybody else...

OK, sure, a deleted part of the scene has Kahless scouring the bottom of the ocean for the sword, which sounds literal enough of a story for Toq to find absurd.

 > **WORF**: How could your mother mate with a Romulan?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **WORF**: It is an obscenity.

We have another "the Black guy needs to learn an important lesson about racism" incident, you'll notice.

 > **WORF**: No, I...It is hard to explain. Klingons and Romulans are blood enemies. Have been for centuries.

Good for him, trying to apologize and explain, even though he doesn't have the vocabulary for it.

 > **BA'EL**: Worf, in spite of everything that's happened, I still sense that you care for me. Am I wrong? You talk so much about being a warrior, about honor and death. Is it so hard to speak of love? Worf, please.

Men, in *this* show, unable to speak openly about their emotions?  Whoever would have imagined such a thing...?

 > **WORF**: I would not have thought it possible to love a Romulan.

I don't know.  She reads as far too young for this to not feel disgusting...

 > **WORF**: No, sir. There was no prison camp. Those young people are survivors of a vessel that crashed in the Carraya system four years ago. No one survived Khitomer.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I understand.

Picard has one opportunity to shine in this episode, and he jumps to take a complicit role in the cover-up.  Worf does it to respect the wishes of the remaining prisoners, but Picard doesn't know anything about that, at this point.

## Conclusions

This mostly revolves around Worf's personal issues, so we don't get much out of the episode.

### The Good

As mentioned, this episode focuses on Worf and, despite a couple of missteps on his part, largely shows his defiance of stereotypes even as he embraces and convinces others to embrace his culture.  He admits that he would gladly accept a dishonored father, if he could get him back.  And he apologizes for his reactionary racism.

### The Bad

The attempted romance not only has the racist overtones, but also seems to suggest that a relationship with someone much younger who has spent her entire life in a prison shouldn't raise any objections.

While this particular instance might seem Klingon-focused, we definitely see that nobody in the Federation has socialized Worf to talk about his feelings in any meaningful way.

And in the end, everybody seems extremely happy to ignore and cover up the existence of a prisoner-of-war camp.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Picard tries to go full John McClane in *Starship Mine*.
