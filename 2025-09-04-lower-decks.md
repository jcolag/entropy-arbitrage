## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Lower Decks

Since last we met, elsewhere in the franchise, O'Brien seemingly spirals out of control trying to sniff out conspiracies in **DS9**'s *Whispers*.

Meanwhile, this episode doesn't quite succeed, but it at least tries to do something different with the format, as the title implies.

 > **RIKER**: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night, Commander?

I keep trying to find the joke, here, as they both react to his suggestion with broad smiles, but I feel like I need to ask directly and seriously:  What does Riker want to do with his life?  He keeps rejecting promotions.  In cases like this, he shows a complete disinterest in the central parts of his current job.  Does he revel in the insipid "hall monitor" part of his job, where he gets to police what the religious women wear and yell at Black people for not having read his mind?  Even that, though, feels like he wants some petty revenge for someone calling him a nerd, not that he enjoys any of it.

I mean, sure, as I've pointed out before, his motivations seem to center entirely on craving Picard's approval so that he can ignore his "daddy issues," but I also feel like an organization that puts its trainees through tests that they can't pass and psychologically tortures them by making them relive their most significant traumas probably wouldn't accept "want to make ~~Dad~~ the captain proud" as a healthy career goal.

Unrelated, what kind of irresponsible monster does their employee evaluations at the bar where their employees go to relax?  That seems like a great way to destroy their recreational area, *and* it risks leaking sensitive information, plus, how do tune out the people that you need to talk about while talking about them?

 > **LAVELLE**: What could be so funny? What's so funny about crew evaluations?

Have you *seen* the crew, ensign?  How can the evaluations not produce riotous laughter, when a couple of weeks ago in [*Homeward*]({% post_url 2025-08-21-homeward %}), everybody either ignored or avoided the foreigner in distress stumbling out of the holodeck?

Speaking of the ensign, you might recognize him as [Dan Gauthier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gauthier), who...I can't see any role that even comes close to his run on **One Life to Live**, but he has made a lot of appearances since around the time that this show started.

 > **OGAWA**: Don't worry about it, Sam.

We last saw Ogawa in [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}), for those keeping track.  I can't help but notice that they suggested there that it wouldn't take much of a change in history for her to become the head of the medical department, but here she has all the clout of sitting at the kids' table...

 > **SITO**: Can't we just try and have a good time here?

In case you thought that you hallucinated [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}), then-Cadet Sito has apparently graduated from Starfleet Academy, presumably along with the rest of the team, who they held back for covering up manslaughter.

 > **TAURIK**: You can't really believe that what you are doing will influence the outcome of your evaluation.

Likewise, you might recognize Taurik as [Alexander Enberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Enberg), who we saw as the reporter in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-21-time-s-arrow-2 %})---not that I recognized the connection---but will go on to recur in **Voyager** as Ensign Vorik, pretty much the same character.

Oh, and you might recognize his mother's name, [Jeri Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeri_Taylor), who passed away last year, but also joined this show with the fourth season---writing [*The Drumhead*]({% post_url 2024-03-28-drumhead %}) among other duties---and worked her way up to show-runner for this season.

 > **SITO**: The Vedeks of the Janalan order maintain a round the clock chant for the benefit of the Bajoran people.
 >
 > **TAURIK**: Considering the history of your planet, that doesn't exactly validate what he's doing.

First off, that seems *incredibly* inappropriate to say to a people climbing out of a decades-long occupation, suggesting that her religion has no validity[^1].  Then, she didn't say when they started chanting.  And "the Bajoran people" seem to have done fairly well, despite decades of living under brutal occupation and/or wandering the galaxy looking for temporary homes.

[^1]:  I'd say that the line "didn't age well," but almost two years into **Deep Space Nine**, definitely the viewers and at least some of Starfleet has already known for a while that the religion's Prophets exist in the form of largely omnipotent creatures who have a specific plan for the Bajoran people in the galaxy.

 > **LAVELLE**: Promote me, please, so I can make Lieutenant and have my own room.

Wait, but *I* thought that "material needs no longer exist," as confidently asserted by Picard in [*The Neutral Zone*]({% post_url 2022-11-10-neutral-zone %}).  Do you mean to say that the man who grew up in his ancestral castle, surrounded by servants, might not actually understand economics for anybody but the wealthy?

 > **BEN**: You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert?
 >
 > **TROI**: Yes. Don't tempt me.

Never forget that Troi has exactly one personality trait, her love of chocolate.

 > **BEN**: All right, but I'm not sure you two are going to like it. Apparently, you two are up for the same job.

See?  When you do your Human Resources work where your employees loiter, information leaks out.  Personally, I would've guessed that the leak would come from them speaking so loudly that you can hear the two clowns across the room and probably see what they have on their computers, *but* an indiscreet server also works.  Imagine if the decision involved something secret or embarrassing about one of the candidates, which somebody could casually overhear.

And I'll ignore the optics of assigning the only Black guy to hospitality work that they have denigrated as beneath people of significance, in episodes like [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %})...

 > **RIKER**: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy, but it works.

I don't know what any of that gibberish should actually mean, but I will point out a couple of things.  First, once again, Riker has tried to strongly imply that the Academy doesn't teach "real"...star trekking?  What do these people do?  Anyway, it also sounds suspiciously like Riker voiced one of our old suspicions, that they intend for the *Enterprise* to always operate from an offensive posture.  Finally, this comment feels like it primarily undermines Worf's authority, since he placed her in this job, and so she presumably does it as he instructed her to, not necessarily what the Academy teaches.

 > **RIKER**: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign.

I suppose that this makes his petty harassment of Ensign Ro seem slightly less racist, at least.

 > **SITO**: A spider under the table.
 >
 > **LAVELLE**: Is that like a fly on the wall?

OK, first, we see the trope where people from other cultures have an obligation to speak in English, almost entirely so that native speakers can criticize them for not doing it flawlessly.  Remember that, in *The First Duty*, they referred to everybody by their given names except for Sito, and I can't help tying Lavelle's comment to that seeming racist trope.

Also, though, what the Hell *other* interpretation could that possibly have that he needs to stop and ask?  An idiom such as "a spider under the table" feels like the sort of thing that, if you heard someone else use it, seems so clear in its intent that you'd almost certainly assume that people use it all the time, and you never noticed.  If she had said that she wanted to "take the occasion for the hairs" or "have very deal bear" for a tree[^2], then sure, wonder what the heck she meant.  But I'd bet that anybody would understand the idea of a spider under a table, *unless* they had some motivation to avoid understanding it, like making a colleague feel bad for not speaking impeccable idiomatic English.

[^2]:  Examples come courtesy of [**O novo guia da conversação em portuguez e inglez**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_She_Is_Spoke) (1855) by Pedro Carolino, later known as **English As She Is Spoke** by publishers mining the inept phrasebook for humor.  I find it more amusing than I probably should...

 > **LAFORGE**: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't hesitate to run them by me.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I'll get back to you on that.

I see that La Forge has gotten on-board for the management style where you solicit ideas from somebody specifically so that you can shut them down.

 > **CRUSHER**: What? Sit down.

I'll never not find it funny that this show has gone so far out of its way, from [the first episode]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}) on, to convince us of Crusher's unfriendly demeanor...but then turns around and consistently makes her one of the rare clowns of the set who actually cares about her colleagues or really anybody who she doesn't want to sleep with.  They also do that with Worf, and that'll bear out in this episode, too.

 > **SITO**: I only filled in at Ops for a half hour, but I had to degauss the main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal sensors to find a lost puppy.

Trivial point, but for younger readers, when this aired, we all know the term [degauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing), because computer monitors had a button to do it.  And we got addicted to pushing the button like a lab rat demanding a pellet, because the button had the visual effect of wildly shaking the image for around a second.  CRT monitors and televisions also automatically degauss during the power-up cycle.

I really quote this line, though, for the last item.  We've talked about irresponsible pet ownership in recent episodes such as [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}), so it doesn't come as a huge surprise that pets want to escape the crew quarters and hide from people who see them as weird trophies.  But I find it funny and telling that this "utopia" has planted a tracking device on all the *people*, but even though we put tracking microchips in pets today, that requires scanning the ship for biological signatures that seem out of place.  And we could laugh this off as an example of the writers not knowing about future technology, but the UK already had microchips for pet identification *and* GPS had civilian customers for a couple of years, by this point, though civilian GPS had an error of up to a hundred meters introduced to prevent people from using it for paramilitary purposes.  And the show does have the characters wear their tracking devices at all times, so they see a value in having this data.

 > **LAVELLE**: What could they be talking about?
 >
 > **TAURIK**: Have you ever considered learning to lip-read?

Again, they wouldn't have this potential security problem if they conducted sensitive business in private instead of at the bar next to the people who they need to talk about.

 > **BEN**: He likes Jazz, poker. He's Canadian.
 >
 > **LAVELLE**: Yeah? My grandfather was from Canada.

They really love this "mild gradations of white people" thing.  [*Sub Rosa*]({% post_url 2025-08-28-sub-rosa %}) got into the distinctiveness of the Scottish Highlanders, and this wants to draw a clear distinction between Canada and Alaska, or really probably most of the United States.

 > **DATA**: Less than five thousand kilometers, sir.

Perhaps in retroactive response to my wondering about setting things "three light years" from the border with the Cardassians in *Parallels* and *Homeward* over the last couple of weeks, this episode wants to get us three million times closer...

 > **LAVELLE**: Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay on for another shift. I could use the training.

For reference, in [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}), we discovered that the ship operates on three shifts, and they've at least strongly suggested that one day on the ship looks like an Earth-day, other than the tin-pot dictators needing to declare the start to morning and night.  I raise this, because if Lavelle already might not perform up to expectations, who in their right mind would expect him to do well at the end of a sixteen-hour shift?

We know that they value "butts in seats" as a measure of commitment, though, as Picard explained in [*The Next Phase*]({% post_url 2024-10-24-next-phase %}).

 > **SITO**: Seven months, sir.

This seems to indicate that one season/one thousand stardates equates to around one year.  *The First Duty* came about three-quarters of the way through the fifth season, and involved Nova Squadron training for a stunt to entertain at their graduation.  As a result of the shoddy conspiracy, most of the team needed to repeat their final year as punishment, so Sito (and Wesley and the other one who we don't care about) presumably graduated one year later, roughly around [*Lessons*]({% post_url 2025-03-27-lessons %}).  And this episode aired about ten months after *Lessons*.  Trimming out the three months between seasons---justified both by the dating running a full thousand over the course of a season and the fact that the sixth finale and seventh opener occur continuously---gives us seven months.

 > **PICARD**: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead, you joined with the others to pretend that was simply an accident. Now, what do you think that tells me about your character?

Oh, *now* he cares.  Remember that, at the end of *The First Duty*, he had no issues with the investigation fizzling out at the end, despite catching multiple members of the team in outright lies.

 > **SITO**: Sir, if you had any idea what it was like after that incident. I didn't have any friends. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had to take my flight test with the instructor because no one else would be my partner. In a lot of ways it would have been easier to just walk away, but I didn't. I stuck with it. Doesn't that say something about my character, too?

Don't take this the wrong way, because I like the character and almost would have liked the ending to have panned out differently so that the franchise could've made her important somewhere else.  However, she didn't do anything to stop a friend and teammate from dying in a banned stunt that she helped plan, then joined the conspiracy to cover up their negligence-to-malfeasance.

I believe in giving second chances more than most people, but yeah, people stop wanting to partner up with you when you try to sell out your previous partner.  Pushing through says a lot less about character than *atoning* for the poor judgment, which doesn't get any mention, here.

The scene almost feels like it needs some twist or revelation that gives her more of an active role in her redemption than "did the time."  For example, if she had leaked the information that nearly got her team busted (before the admiral arbitrarily gave up), that might have made her isolation more compelling.

 > **PICARD**: Well, I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at the Academy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelled for what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on board this ship. You're dismissed.

I really don't understand why people love Picard.  One of the most privileged weirdos in the galaxy, he hauls this kid---a refugee from a planet where speaking out of turn could've gotten her tortured or killed, who joined an organization that believes in a strict hierarchy to the point where they *might* need to comply with illegal orders---into his office to harass her and blatantly lie to her, to see if she'll stand up to him.  I hope that people understand the amount of sleaze involved, here.

This pans out like a white person insisting that their behavior doesn't qualify as racist, because none of our non-white friends complain.  And no, they *wouldn't* complain, because a massive part of white privilege stems from the dangers of escalation.  For example, in the United States, if I anger or frighten a non-white person, the consequences probably won't spread further than their not trusting me anymore.  But if they anger or frighten me, I have the structural option of calling the cops, which then immediately puts their lives in danger.  In theory, they could call the cops, too, but that still puts them in danger, not me, one of the worst parts of this.  Even if we don't go to that extreme, think about how often you see white people try to insist that calling them racist actually causes more harm than racism.  In other words, if your friends haven't called you out for saying racist things, they probably avoid the topic because they assume that you'll make yourself the victim to protect, not because you get everything right.

Further from the topic at hand, but the same goes for gender-based issues.  We know that men have sexually assaulted nearly [one third of women](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women), most of that from an intimate partner.  Yet most men don't know any such women, because they don't trust us not to minimize or excuse the behavior of their attackers[^3].  We have the responsibility of building trust, rather than assuming that we deserve it.

[^3]:  Shortly before his death, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain gave a series of interviews where he made almost exactly this point, that the #MeToo movement made him realize that his "meathead" persona almost certainly put up a wall between him and his friends and colleagues, making it impossible for him to support people who he cared about when it mattered most, because they didn't see it as worth the risk of confiding in him.

We've talked about comparable dynamics on this show.  Data acts like a full-time people-pleaser, implicitly---but close to explicit, given how many times the threat has come up---because Starfleet could revoke his civil liberties and disassemble him for experimentation.  Sito might well have started her career at Starfleet Academy with people threatening to have her deported back to occupied Bajor.  And even if she didn't, speaking out could still end her career, so she absolutely would *not* stand up to Picard in this little experiment, and it reeks of bigotry for him to have tried it.

 > **CRUSHER**: We'll need to synthesize at least a liter of Cardassian blood.

A Cardassian, near the Cardassian border?  I can't believe it...

 > **RIKER**: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. I don't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position.

It seems worth noting that, at the top of the episode, he also dismissed a candidate for a role, and Troi pointed out that *she* has better people-skills.  Perhaps somebody should investigate his assessment practices.

 > **RIKER**: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiate himself to me.
 >
 > **TROI**: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **TROI**: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lot alike.

I almost pointed out that "too eager to please" sounds awfully familiar, but I suppose that I don't need to.

 > **TROI**: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the officer's game at the *Potemkin*?

Hands up if it surprises you that Riker---who we found out, in [*The Pegasus*]({% post_url 2025-08-14-pegasus %}), started his career by at least covering up serious crimes and *may* have killed his colleagues to win the approval of his captain---reshaped his personality in hopes of climbing the ranks.

Oh, also, Riker's time on the *Potemkin* made up a lot of the back-story for [*Second Chances*]({% post_url 2025-05-01-second-chances %}).

 > **RIKER**: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle.

Ah, yes, his moment of self-reflection comes so that he can give a fellow white guy a hand up.

 > **RIKER**: I am your worst nightmare.

I wouldn't give him nearly that much credit or describe him as having so much power, but if he wants to call himself nightmarish, that gives me less to do, so...

 > **TAURIK**: What I find curious is that when Commander La Forge saw that the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed annoyed.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAVELLE**: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't.

Notice that, even at the lowest levels of the ship, they need their inane plays for dominance.

 > **BEN**: Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have to get to sleep even earlier?

Could you imagine if this show showed off that "more responsibility" that they get, instead of watching them play games or pretend that they live someplace else...?

More relevant, though, note the indication of how civilians see Starfleet, as an institution to exploit people's ambitions.

 > **WORF**: Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **WORF**: It takes courage to say the test is unfair.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **WORF**: No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly, it will not take so many bruises for you protest.

I won't complain about his using the same sleazy tactics as Picard, because (a) Worf definitely knows about the unfairness and has experienced it himself, and (b) he almost certainly did this at Picard's direction.  But I will point out how much more compassionate his version works, despite the physical pain.  Unlike Picard, Worf made the situation overtly unfair, then explained the lesson, and made his expectations clear, rather than batting her around and wondering if she'll read his mind.

 > **PICARD**: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the *Enterprise*. I asked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance to redeem yourself.

You'd think that somebody who wanted to give her "a fair chance to redeem" herself might have reached out sooner than seven months into the gig.  He might have also not made their first interaction abusive, to put her in a situation where she either "fails the test" or risks getting punished, if he wanted a fair chance.

 > **PICARD**: Very well, Ensign, will you report to Sickbay? Doctor Crusher will explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss this mission with anyone.

It feels like secrecy *should* go without saying, but also...why?  Do they have such lax security that some ensign mentioning a secret mission will somehow get back to the Cardassian government before they cross the border?

 > **JORET**: I don't consider myself a traitor, if that's what you're asking. All my life I've served in the military. Once it was an institution dedicated to the security of Cardassia, now it's little more than a platform for ambitious Guls hoping to make their reputations in battle. If the information I provided helps Starfleet deter even one pointless skirmish, I've served my purpose. I'm sick of war. My people need peace.

Since [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}), especially *Chain of Command*, and excepting the occupation of Bajor, the show has fairly consistently tried to draw parallels between the Federation and the Cardassians, suggesting that their governments and their more ambitious military officers see themselves as upholding and defending the only compassionate civilization.  Here, note the echo of [*Q Who?*]({% post_url 2023-03-09-q-who %}), where Picard talked about how "what we most needed was a kick in our complacency," in his first encounter with the Borg, or how *The Wounded* indicated that the Federation only really wanted to avoid a war because they forecast a loss, when Joret talks about "ambitious [captains] hoping to make their reputations in battle."

 > **RIKER**: Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treaty violation.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready.

Look, I have grown to like the character, too, but violating a treaty, and presumably risking a war, to slightly improve the chances of saving her seems more than a bit irresponsible.

 > **PICARD**: To all Starfleet personnel, this is the Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew, Ensign Sito Jaxa has been lost in the line of duty. She was the finest example of a Starfleet officer, and a young woman of remarkable courage and strength of character. Her loss will be deeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out.

Did he actually learn to express grief?  Fetch the fainting couch...

 > **LAVELLE**: Thanks. It just don't feel right. For all I know, she was going to get the promotion instead of me.
 >
 > **BEN**: You shouldn't feel that way, Sam.

Oh, he should *definitely* feel that way.  I see no version of the retelling where he didn't almost literally step over the corpse of a woman from a disadvantaged background and in the process of redeeming herself for a prior criminal act to [Monkey's Paw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw) his wish for a promotion...

Honestly, a gutsier show would've taken advantage of the parallels between the Cardassians and the Federation hinted at earlier, plus Lavelle's brown-nosing, need to form relationships with senior officers, and nosiness---the last even going so far as trying to guilt his friends into revealing the secret mission---and exposed him as a spy for the Cardassians later in the season...or right here.

 > **BEN**: Sir, I happen to know that she considered you a friend.

OK, I complain about this show a *lot*---and I think legitimately so, given how much the fans and franchise point to this Reagan-era jingoism as the pinnacle of what the future should look like---but I may have gotten a bit choked up at Worf changing tables.  Even I can admit to the occasional moments of solid craft.

Anyway, as most readers presumably know, this episode inspired and lends its name to **Lower Decks**, the tail end of the fourth season bringing back Shannon Fill as Sito, in a flashback to justify the protagonist's career path and deliver the franchise's one---absurdly mild, given everything that we've seen for six-and-a-half seasons---criticism of Picard.

## Conclusions

In some ways, this episode gives us exactly what we've looked for in this series.

### The Good

Crusher, and to a lesser extent Worf, display a progressive approach to management, taking an active interest in their reports and doing what they can to take care of them.

We have also finally found a situation where the crew finds it acceptable to express their grief, though most of them still try to do it in private.

### The Bad

We continue to see indications that, despite prior insistence that they all work purely for personal gratification, people dislike their jobs.  Maybe related, a lot of this episode centers on their craving for status, whether ingratiating themselves with superiors, posturing for dominance, or looking for promotions.  Yet we also get the sense that civilians see Starfleet as unfairly capitalizing on the love for work.

We also see incredibly unprofessional behavior from senior officers, doing personnel work in front of their direct reports, but hoping that no information slips out while they speak loudly in public.

Anti-Bajoran sentiment also returns, with a character suggesting that the Cardassian occupation means that they follow a false religion.  People also reflexively reject and criticize Bajoran idioms.  And people in authority seem to find it interesting to manipulate, pressure, and bully their Bajoran colleagues to test their openness, which Picard describes as fair.  Similarly, we see incredibly fine distinctions made between humans with light skin, as if those differences have more weight, not to mention Riker's one moment of remorse coming from his concerns that he didn't give the white man a fair chance; the episode even ends trying to make that white guy the victim in a woman's death.  And we also see some sexism, with the episode even rightly emphasizing it as wrong.

They have returned to anti-intellectual rhetoric, bashing the Academy for not teaching useful things.  Likewise, they imply that their reality focuses on keeping the ship always ready for combat.  They also seem to find clear metaphors difficult to interpret because they only accept an idiom.

We continue to see terrible management, where in this case La Forge tries to ignore his employee.

### The Weird

We still get mixed messages on the Federation's economy.

They track the people on the ship at all times, but not the animals traveling with them.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Data tries to poison an entire civilization, while Troi tries to put on her big-girl pants, in *Thine Own Self*.
