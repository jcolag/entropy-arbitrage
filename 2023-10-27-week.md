As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

This article covers a lot more ground than I can cover in an excerpt and a summary.  Go read it.

The study pitches this as a story of unintended consequences of stopping Purdue, and *not* of corporate greed requiring regulation to keep it in check.

Since the post makes a point to mention credit unions as an alternative to this nonsense, I'll echo that endorsement.  I switched over to the local credit union over a decade ago, and can only honestly complain that I didn't think to do so sooner.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [An interoperability rule for your money](https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/21/let-my-dollars-go/#personal-financial-data-rights) from Pluralistic

 > So if you tell your bank to give your data to a competitor â€“ or a comparison shopping site â€“ it will have to do so...or else.

Yes, this goes into different aspects of the same rule as the Friday article.  It seemed warranted.
