This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes (at least for now) reading **Trois écoles** (**Three Schools**), covering the remainder of *Fluorine ombre* and going through the first segment (until the three asterisks) of *Manganèse*.

![The book's cover, with the title above a brightly colored camouflage pattern](/blog/assets/trois-ecoles-cover.png "Well, that almost hurts my eyes...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Trois écoles — Première partie**
 * Location:  <https://troisecoles.noblogs.org/>, <https://codeberg.org/ortaviz/Trois_ecoles>
 * Released:  2024
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Wilem Ortiz
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately seventy-four thousand (French) words
 * Content Advisories:  Policing, political violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Trois écoles

The book's website describes it as follows.

> Au milieu des années 2030 en France, la surveillance commence à se retourner contre les très riches et les gouvernants. Des chaînes de volontaires de plus en plus efficaces se fédèrent chaque jour de façon anonyme pour espionner grands patrons et cabinets de consultants. Parmi tous ces noyaux de contre-surveillance quotidienne, un petit groupe mieux organisé garde encore le secret. Depuis plus de dix ans, sa logistique clandestine se perpétue en vue d’attaquer un jour, pour de bon, les nœuds du pouvoir.
>
> À une époque de changements technologiques profonds où les neurosciences commerciales ont fait un bond, c’est une hypothèse à la pointe de la recherche scientifique qui pourrait fournir le moyen d’action le plus efficace, et le plus rapide. L’une des membres du groupe, autodidacte en psychologie et sciences cognitives, y croit dur comme fer.
>
> Mais le temps presse, et les pièces les plus importantes ne sont pas encore en place à l’approche du déclenchement révolutionnaire prévu par le groupe sans nom. Il faut réussir à négocier la sortie de laboratoire d’un outil à technologie neurale, par le réseau d’un trafiquant, et opérer un regroupement géographique avec une ancienne formation de combattantes dispersées à travers l’Europe.
>
> Autour de cette nébuleuse clandestine, des obstacles qu’elle rencontre et de ses contradictions, plusieurs voix, plusieurs parcours naissent ou s’abîment dans l’espoir d’une révolution prochaine.

Or in English, that looks more like this.

> In the mid-2030s in France, surveillance begins to backfire on the very rich and powerful. Increasingly efficient volunteer channels contrive anonymously to spy on the big bosses and consulting firms. Of all these daily counter-surveillance nuclei, a small, better organized group still keeps secret. For more than a decade, its clandestine logistics have been perpetuated in order to attack the centers of power for good.
>
> In a time of profound technological change where commercial neurosciences have leaped forward, there is a hypothesis at the cutting edge of scientific research that could provide the most effective and fastest means of action. One of the group's self-taught members in psychology and cognitive science believes it firmly.
>
> But time is running out, and the most important pieces are not yet in place as the unnamed group approaches their revolutionary trigger. They must successfully negotiate the laboratory theft of a neural technology tool, through a trafficker’s network, and to coordinate a geographical group with a former combatant organization scattered across Europe.
>
> Around this clandestine nebula, the obstacles it encounters and its contradictions, several voices, several paths are born or are damaged in the hope of an imminent revolution.

Oh, speaking of translations, I'll read most if not all the text through machine-translation.  I do this mostly because I've let my French get so rusty that it'd take forever to do this properly, but it comes at the cost that I might miss clever aspects or have trouble following the plot more than I would otherwise.

I should note that, while the author made the book available under the cited license, they have made the "script materials" such as the synopsis and characters available under a CC0 public domain dedication.

## What Works Well?

We finally get a sense of an actual plan that these characters want to enact, which unifies at least some of their little errands into a more cohesive story.  We haven't---and won't until we revisit the book---gotten the intent, but enough pieces of the puzzle start to form a picture.

I should also note that Brahim's entire section does a lot of work expand the world beyond some vaguely disaffected people running those aforementioned errands.  We don't get too deeply into it, but his choice of name re-asserting his erased heritage, his work in an abandoned religious institution, and the development later in the section give a far stronger impression of working against an oppressive political climate than anything that we've seen previously.  Some of the later work with Sabine also hints at it, but it really starts to hit afterward.

Speaking of Sabine, we also get some nicely tense sequences during her escape, though it also seems to introduce paranormal abilities.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

This section continues, and maybe even amplifies, the bizarre alternation between scenes.  At one end, we have these long, detailed descriptions of the most mundane activities imaginable.  At the other end, we get these staccato vignettes, giving us barely enough time to get our bearings in a scene before the lead character of the moment rushes off to the next incident.  Combined with the rotating(?) cast, it doesn't feel like any of it will pay off as the rest of the story comes together.

It also feels like the quality of writing---or maybe its ease of translation?---dropped significantly, here.  Granted, I had other life events and projects taking up time, but it took me *two months* to slog through around twelve thousand words...

## Opportunities

The book does have the repository on Codeberg noted above, which has seen a fairly regular activity by the author every couple of months.  The author also has a couple of other projects that you might find interesting.

## What's Adaptable?

This section brings us some minor technology; Arok, the Polish company in possession of Europe's remaining viable-though-abandoned niobium mine; and the counter-surveillance databases targeting the wealthy, Refund101 and Billionwatch.  We also get more information on the capability of the rebels' car-pods.

Neuroscientists Strateer and Descloux might serve some purpose elsewhere, too, though we don't meet them.  And we spend a fair amount of time at the Institute of Protestant Theological Studies (L’institut d’études théologiques protestant), which doesn't appear to actually exist, even though its Ménilmontant neighborhood and the nearby street where much of the ending of this section takes place does.

Yes, I look these things up for you...

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll set **Trois écoles** for the duration---because I need a break, as much as because I already planned to cut this off after three posts---and move on to **Let It Come From Whom It May**, a metal album by Tyranny Is Tyranny.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
