As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

It genuinely amazes me how much animal cognition that we find, now that we've grown inclined to look for it.  We've found tool use, forms of culture, and this looks a lot like a native language.  We have *not* found evidence of any non-humans that record information for future generations, but we've found pretty much every classic identifier that we would generally use.

While I don't want to anthropomorphize anything, because we might look for the wrong behaviors when we think about intelligence, this seems remarkably parallel to colonization and chattel slavery.  In both cases, humans (or a subset) dismissed all evidence of intelligence and culture on the land that they wanted, to justify sing the land and its people however they pleased.

I wonder how much this overlaps with the fear that many people of color have that, if they complain, that draws attention to them, and they risk some white person either complaining about their temper or calling the police.

Hashtags:  #USPol #VoterSuppression

One of the big problems in American politics, in my eyes---apart from the increasingly literal fascist party, I mean---has to do with how nobody listens to authoritarians or, if they do, they give what they say the most benign interpretation possible.  For example, Republicans have spent decades saying that "the states are the laboratories of democracy."  They meant that.  Specifically, they meant that control of state governments allow them to test anti-democratic measures, to see which measures not only work, but pass sufficient legal scrutiny to safely replicate and expand.

Meanwhile, we have voters worrying about whether the specific man behind a handful of measures gets elected, as if the specific face matters.

I've said since Trump's first day in office in 2017 that we need to ignore all the stories about who secretly hates him.  It doesn't matter, because he supports the destructive policies that they support, and so they'll happily support him, then have a staffer try to rehabilitate their images with secret hatreds.

Don't worry.  I don't think much more of the Republicans who *refuse* to support Trump, because they still support the same policies, and only object to the "personality" presenting them.

 > Have the AI chatbots been getting worse? It feels like they have increasingly gotten into the business of avoiding work instead of doing work. Occasionally, I give one a task like "write a short story about that," or "take this file and modify its contents to represent this well-known thing." I've gotten more and more non-solutions, like telling me how I could do the work or repeating my file back to me verbatim, then giving me something entirely unrelated when I complain that it got it wrong...

I consider that a serious question, though I can understand why some might read it as a joke.  As you can probably guess, I have a pile of one-off projects that I'd like to work on, and AI seems like a perfect way to make progress on at least some of them, by providing a rough draft to edit and add a "voice" to.  It used to do this extremely well.

Recently, though, it almost feels like somebody programmed ChatGPT in particular to avoid work.

For an example, I gave it a function and asked it to refactor the code.  It chose to define refactoring for me.  When I explained that I didn't ask for a definition, it gave me a list of steps to walk through for refactoring.  Again, I complained, and it gave me...the original function.  One last time, I explained the problem with that answer, and it generated some entirely unrelated code.

In similar cases, it now only tells the same prose or scripted story, where two people disagree about something, and decide to accept it.

Other projects require more explanation---enough to fill their own blog posts, if I thought that they had enough distinctive features to interest readers---but the generated results proved increasingly implausible and erratic.  Though in my "favorite," most frustrating case, the AI would keep "forgetting" what I had asked it.  I put that in sarcasm-quotes, because it could query the conversation to summarize my requests, but when I told it to finish the work, it'd insist that I needed to repeat the question to make progress, but doing so would cause it to repeat the previous wrong solution.

I generally support automating jobs away, specifically because of these issues.  I would love to have a robot deliver my groceries, so that I don't need to worry that the weather will turn, or someone driving through my neighborhood will make it unsafe.  We need an economic system that makes sure that these people don't run out of money, but we also can't keep asking them to literally put their lives on the line for sub-minimum wage.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [New American Psychological Association guidelines: Parents should advise teenagers on social media use, impose restrictions](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_American_Psychological_Association_guidelines:_Parents_should_advise_teenagers_on_social_media_use,_impose_restrictions) from WikiNews

 > According to the report, before teenagers use social media, parents should provide guidance on social media literacy and support for psychological development.

While certainly not the most critical story, enough parents read here---and social media use has always made good fodder for this blog---that I couldn't ignore it.

I generally ignore UK news, since I've never lived there and so have little to no context for anything, but this felt universal enough to warrant reading and sharing.
