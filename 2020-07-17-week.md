As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1282662311035957248) [How school choice systems create unfair advantages](https://www.fastcompany.com/90523664/how-school-choice-systems-create-unfair-advantages) from Fast Company

 > ...can lead to circumstances in which lotteries for public school seats unintentionally favor students with access to private schools.

That's, of course, in *addition* to all the more direct attacks on public schools, like "vouchers" taking the tax money meant to fund public schools and redirect it, starving the community that can't get into schools that are allowed to discriminate in their admissions policies.

 > The ad, which superimposed video of Biden kneeling at a church in Delaware last month on to the snippets from Allahverdiâ€™s footage, is based on a pair of lies.

It's interesting to see the campaign flailing around.  Every avenue they've taken in the last couple of months only seems to make things worse for them.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1283386080150970369) [Voting Rights Act led to fewer racially biased arrests](https://www.futurity.org/voting-rights-act-racially-biased-arrests-2399282/) from Futurity

 > ...if everyone has equal access to the vote, it can improve police officers' treatment of Black Americans.

This is a critical point.  When people are disenfranchised, they can't easily affect policy, which makes them easier targets.

 > The firings were just a small piece of a bigger reconfiguring of the organizations administered by USAGM, which include government-run media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.

This is going to be a nightmare to untangle.  All of these projects, to be clear, exist as a showcase of American freedom, indirect propaganda by showing that our government is funding the ability to evade government monitoring and media critical to the administration.  But shuttering everything that can't be complimentary to the current administration shows that we won't live up to our values.

 > Essaydi is a poet of architecture, the female body, and color.

An artist interview is hardly the most important story out there, but her work is excellent and touches on a lot of issues that I assume interest readers.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How air pollution makes COVID-19 worse](https://www.futurity.org/covid-19-air-pollution-2398022/) from Futurity

 > ...it is thought that particulate and nitrogen dioxide found in air pollution can act as vectors for the spread and survival of airborne particles such as COVID.

Among other things, this might explain why closing the economy works so well *and* why Black and Latinx people are suffering from COVID-19 more than other groups.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [3 science-backed tips for fighting your social distancing fatigue](https://www.fastcompany.com/90524674/3-science-backed-tips-for-fighting-your-social-distancing-fatigue) from Fast Company

 > Another thing that can help is doing nice things for people around you.

Obviously, this isn't going away, especially with states that are now banning local mask orders.
