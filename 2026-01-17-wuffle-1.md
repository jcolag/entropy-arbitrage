To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Wuffle**
 * Location:  <https://wufflecomics.tumblr.com/>
 * Released:  2012 -- 2015 (or maybe 2021)
 * License:  CC0
 * Creator:  Piti Yindee
 * Medium:  Web comic
 * Length:  Approximately 195 pages
 * Content Advisories:  One possible racist visual reference, occasional fear and danger

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Wuffle

The creator of the comic describes it as follows.

> **Wuffle** is different from other wolves. While most wolves are sneaky and tricky, Wuffle is innocent, naive, and kind-hearted, always willing to help people without expecting anything in return.
>
> **Wuffle** was actually one of the projects that started back in the year 2008. At that time, he was designed to be the main character of the game with the same name.
>
> The game is a parody of many famous fairy tales with a wolf in the story, such as the Three Little Pigs, and the Little Red Riding Hood.
>
> It was supposed to be a platformer game about Wuffle fighting the three evil pigs, stopping them from destroying his land and turn the land into big factories.
>
> Unfortunately, we never actually had time to work on the project, and it eventually got cancelled.
>
> However, I was really in love with Wuffle’s design. I want to see him comes to life in some form. If he can’t be in a game, then he can be in something else. And that’s when I started working on the Wuffle comics project.
>
> Finally, after 4 years, I think I have found the perfect story for him. I just want to see him comes to life, see him living his little adventure with his friends. And here it is, in your hand, the comic as you can see today.
>
> I want Wuffle to be a comic for everyone. I want to bring back the old charms of the good old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young.
>
> I hope you enjoy the comic, and will come to love Wuffle the same way that I have.  
>
> Welcome to the world of Wuffle, the big heart wolf!

I have actually had this on my radar for a while, but somehow kept forgetting about it for some reason.

## What Works Well?

Right from the start, it strikes me how *competent* the comic feels.  It looks nice, with consistent designs and clear layouts, and the jokes almost all land.  Normally, I would expect the first months (or years) of a weekly comic to need to refine the style and humor, but this seems to appear fully formed from the start.

It still does evolve, though, in moving more towards longer-term storytelling.  You see some early stories that roll the consequences of one joke into the next week, but later get full stories spanning ten pages seemingly dropped in a week.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

At least at this point, some characters seem to only exist for the sake of a joke, with nothing more to them.  For single appearances, we might ignore that, because we don't spend time with them without that.  But, for example, the squirrel seems to exist to stop by every few months to have a joke about stuffing food in her cheek-pouches.

## Opportunities

The author appears go have moved on from the comic, but does have an active [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/pitiyindee) working on a traditional hand-animated cartoon for a different wolf character.

## What's Adaptable?

We see Foxxo's Gingerbread Bakery, GGB News, **Nightmare on Gingerbread Street**, the unnamed mail delivery organization that seems to start with an *F*, and the *War of Werewolves* franchise.

While the Pine Pad *technically* seems original to the comic, too, it surely refers to the [Pine Tab](https://pine64.org/2023/04/10/pinetab-v-and-pinetab2-launch/) and predecessors such as the [Pine Phone](https://pine64.org/devices/pinephone/).  And I assume that **Astro Wuf** derives from [*Astro Boy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy), though I don't know the franchise nearly well enough to guess how closely.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading **Wuffle**, moving on to the comics archived for 2013.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
