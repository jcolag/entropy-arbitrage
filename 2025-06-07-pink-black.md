This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to **The Pink and Black Album**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **The Pink and Black Album**
 * Location:  <https://dogparkdissidents.bandcamp.com/album/the-pink-and-black-album>
 * Released:  2023
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Dog Park Dissidents](https://dogparkdissidents.bandcamp.com/)
 * Medium:  Music album

 * Content Advisories:  Fictional violence, some coarse language and the occasional sexual reference (more than "some/occasional" in *Trans Starship Feminist BDSM Paradise*)

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Pink and Black Album

The band describes itself as follows.

 >  Dog Park Dissidents are a queer punk band from New Orleans, Long Island, and Philadelphia, featuring Zac Xeper (he/they, vocals), Jon Greco (he/him, guitar), Joe Bove (he/him, bass), Zeke Xander (they/them, drums), and Skylar Stravinsky (she/they, guitar). They bend genres, genders, and decency, blending old-school anarchist punk energy with contemporary pop punk and low camp. Also, they are dogs.

The album itself doesn't have any description beyond credits.

Used under license 

You know what I know.  However, in the spirit of full disclosure, the band's self-description calls out at least one member as hailing from Long Island, making it *possible* (with only about twelve hundred square miles) that I've crossed paths with some of them, though I don't actually know and don't find it appropriate to find out, unless one of them wants to write in.

## What Works Well?

I have to appreciate the double-meanings that many of these songs carry, and I don't mean the usual interpretation of that sort of approach of something risqué hiding behind a conventional term, though you'll spot some of that, too.  In at least a few of the pieces, you have a highly fictional and stylized story, but it also serves as and occasionally overtly mentions a resistance to participation in an oppressive society.

We also have songs that feel somewhat innocuous, the sort of thing that we've all heard a million times before, but then take heartbreaking but extremely real turns.  Or, like *Class Struggle*, it takes a bleak landscape that echoes some themes touched on in the last paragraph to refocus in ways that I think that a lot of reasons might understand.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The album feels unfairly interrupted and intruded-on by prior, commercial, so-famous-that-even-I-recognize-the-song *Toxic*.  It doesn't really fit with the other songs by any measurement, sitting there for three minutes and change that could've gone to almost anything else---an extended or "clean" version of *Pronouns*[^1], maybe---or skipped entirely without anybody noticing its omission.

[^1]:  I actually like the idea of an alternate version of this song that (for example) a kid could play in school to underscore a point without getting into trouble for entirely superficial reasons as a pretext to silence them.

## Opportunities

As usual for Bandcamp, you can buy the album and leave (polite) comments.

## What's Adaptable?

The storytelling goes fairly deep on a lot of these songs, from the *Bad Dog*/*Good Boy* pair, the recurring ideas of what it does to try to change a system from inside and a hypothetical queer uprising, and an entire queer, kinky space opera franchise that I hope somebody adapts in detail.

Note that you probably *can't* adapt their cover of *Toxic* without licensing it from the original label.

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll watch **Tag Team**, an animated short.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
