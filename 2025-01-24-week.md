* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I assume that everybody reading this already knows that these mass deportation plans have their basis in hatred, not science, no matter how they try to connect it.  I won't draw trite comparisons to prior regimes that attempted ethnic cleansing, but you can see as well as I can that it has *never* had a basis in anything other than bigotry.

As this post goes out, like most other people in the United States, I only recently crawled out of dangerously frigid temperatures that covered a bunch of the country when I sent the toot, so the idea of excessive humidity hasn't grabbed many people's attention.  In the summer, though, something like this could mean the difference between health and injury.

It really does impress me how often the gears of authoritarianism grind to a halt, because somebody said "no, thanks, we won't do that."  It takes that little to derail these people.

Granted, we've all predicted the ultimate end to this waste and gotten it extremely wrong, but remember that the far right has become a tenuous "big tent" full of contradictory policy needs, thin-skinned power-brokers with competing egos, and a violent movement that believes the people who they helped put in office owe them something.  On top of that, we have growing progressive currents.  I don't mean to suggest that we sit back and watch how it plays out, but rather that we have the opportunity to have them tear each other apart.

And it takes only a handful of them putting each other in hospitals (or worse) or having each other arrested for petty reasons before Hakeem Jeffries accidentally ends up in the Oval Office...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > This new organization will retain ownership of the Mastodon brand and copyright, along with platform components and other assets. One aspect worth noting here is that CEO Eugen Rochko will likely be transitioning away from CEO into a new role that allows him to better focus on software development.

I know that Rochko has had this in the works for a long time, so seeing it actually happen feels great, despite my having no involvement with any of it.

 > Pixelfed is experiencing a surge in user signups in recent days, after Meta announced that it would loosen its rules to allow users to call LGBTQ+ people “mentally ill” [amid a host of other changes](https://www.404media.co/its-total-chaos-internally-at-meta-right-now-employees-protest-zuckerbergs-anti-lgbtq-changes/) that shift the company overtly to the right. Meta and Instagram have also leaned heavily into AI-generated content. Pixelfed announced earlier Monday [<u>that it is launching an iOS app</u>](https://mastodon.social/@pixelfed/113820254451707651?ref=404media.co) later this week.

It seems notable that, whenever these link-blocks happen---Twitter did the same thing for a while, remember, until the community shamed them into retracting the policy---they primarily target the Fediverse, then gradually include other competitors.  It shows, with full clarity, who they see as competition.  Meta doesn't care if you want to use the photo-sharing app that runs on Bluesky's AT Protocol...
