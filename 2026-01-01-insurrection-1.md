Before we get going, I'd like to wish everybody a Happy New Year, with the usual disclaimer to have a generally great day if you happen to use a different calendar.

## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Insurrection

Since last time, we have jumped another two years.  **Deep Space Nine** finished its fifth season, made it through its sixth, and started its final season.  **Voyager** did the same with its third, fourth, and fifth seasons.

And as a quick note, I want to reiterate that we break new ground with this post, in that, as I write this---but not when you read it, {% emoji crossed fingers %} I hope---I have never watched this film or **Nemesis**.  Without having the details kicking around in my head for decades, and also trying to absorb the story, I may overlook something.

 > **STARFLEET OFFICER #1**: Base to Ensign McCauley and Ensign Gilles, please report to area seven and assist the edaphology team.

Shockingly, they did *not* invent [edaphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edaphology), one of the two branches of soil science.

 > **GALLATIN**: Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this. Transmit it to the ship.

You might (or might not, with the prosthetics) recognize Gallatin as [Gregg Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Henry), who has shown up pretty much everywhere for about half a century.

 > **ANIJ**: Who are they?

You might recognize Anij as Broadway star [Donna Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Murphy), probably best known for playing the antagonist in Disney's **Tangled**.

Also, other than the goofy invisibility suits, you might notice the similarity so far to [*Who Watches the Watchers?*]({% post_url 2023-05-25-who-watches-watchers %}).

 > **CRUSHER**: You either need a new uniform or a new neck.

It seems worth noting that Picard somehow has the two token women in the crew waiting on him while he stands idly around whining.  Can he not dress himself?  Can the computer not read the file to him?  Otherwise, it looks a lot like he did (or they volunteered to do) this to exert his authority over them.  Or maybe the whining takes up so much of his energy that he can't also figure out how to fasten a few buttons and pull up his pants.

Also, they still haven't figured out that, if they can have the computer manufacture food and gifts, that it can also probably produce tailored uniforms.

And title aside, I have to assume that this story will involve Picard committing massively unethical acts.  Why?  I don't think that the show has ever presented us with somebody wearing a blazer who they didn't expose as absurdly shady.

 > **TROI**: Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums.

Yes, we must mock the strange foreign customs for eating...wait, no, people eat chrysanthemums, particularly Asian cultures.  But we have seen their characterization of foreign foods as disgusting since at least [*A Matter of Honor*]({% post_url 2023-01-12-matter-honor %}).

Notably and maybe related, this sequence hammers hard on the idea that Troi needs to repeatedly remind Picard how to repeat a four-syllable greeting---each syllable a tidy consonant-vowel-consonant sequence, by the way---which seems to strongly hint that all his prior diplomatic work has had a similar amount of forcing him to do the bare minimum.

Oh, also, the Federation has apparently "caught up" with our world, at this point, to cast vegetarians as aberrant nuisances instead of an ordinary diet that billions of humans maintain.  Today, you probably wouldn't even consider holding an event like this without providing for the inevitable vegetarians, but they apparently can't imagine an entire civilization that doesn't eat meat.  Or actually, they apparently have trouble imagining a culture that includes vegetables in their diet at all.

 > **RIKER**: They need us to mediate some territorial dispute.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Oh, no! We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. That'll put us right in the middle of monsoon season.

I know, right?  Averting wars and presumably saving billions of lives really cuts into the whole "pillaging ancient heritage sites" hobby.

Wow, not even eight minutes in, and I already want to ask if these characters ever do anything that we should actually applaud them for.  Also, I can't believe that we have only gotten eight minutes into this.  That does *not* bode well.

 > **RIKER**: The diplomatic corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.

As mentioned, when this hit theaters, **Deep Space Nine** would start to shift into its final Dominion-heavy arc.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, so they need us to put out one more brush fire. Can anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

Not really, no.  They always treated that as lower-class work beneath their station---they took those exploratory missions as excuses to go play games, remember, or took any opportunity to take on something else---and complained that the Prime Directive forbade them from conquering planets to take whatever they found, culminating in Picard's "kick in our complacency" speech at the end of [*Deja Q*]({% post_url 2023-07-27-deja-q %}).  And, not to put too fine a point on it, but **somebody** wrecked the ship designed for sustained deep space exploration during [**Generations**]({% post_url 2025-12-11-star-trek-generations-2 %}), which might explain why they no longer get assigned those missions.

 > **CRUSHER**: And the Federation Council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly?
 >
 > **PICARD**: In view of our losses to the Borg and the Dominion, the Council feels we need all the allies we can get these days.

Ah, yes, the apocalyptic war with the Borg that nobody bothered to mention on **Deep Space Nine**, with only one battle that we know of from [**First Contact**]({% post_url 2025-12-18-first-contact-1 %}) two years back (two weeks ago, our time) that didn't actually destroy any ships.  Have they replaced the Romulans as the official danger hiding behind every lamp post?  It seems like the Dominion presents enough of a real threat to not need a spare.

 > **CRUSHER**: The Captain used to cut quite a rug.

You might notice that they spent several episodes starting with [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %}), trying to demean Crusher as "the dancing doctor," but Picard apparently also had a previous run as a dancer and...nobody really seems to care.  They shoot each other "knowing looks," but they come off more annoyed at the conversation than having a joke at the captain's expense.

 > **CRUSHER**: Worf!
 >
 > **PICARD**: What the hell are you doing here?
 >
 > **WORF**: I was at the Manzar colony...
 >
 > **RIKER**: He's a little late, Geordi, can it wait?

They all look so self-satisfied having Riker interrupt Worf---which certainly tracks with his usual behavior, and should make us wonder how he still has a job---so that they don't need to write an actual reason for Worf to show up that makes any sense.

 > **PICARD**: Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar. Welcome aboard the Enterprise.

I gather that, despite what you might read in the credits, you heard some part of Mozart's [String Quartet No. 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Quartet_No._17_%28Mozart%29) wrapping up shortly before this.

 > **CUZAR**: Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people. We are so honored to be accepted within the great Federation family.

Again, note the immediate disdain that they have for this culture.  Picard feels silly for stooping to their height, and everybody finds the head-wear hilarious, because *they* certainly don't wear silly things...like spandex that rides up or giant talking badges.

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain. Excuse me. Captain...Captain, Admiral Dougherty's aboard a Son'a ship in sector four-four-one. He's requesting Data's schematics.

Does that really seem like a "call the *Enterprise*" kind of project?  Wouldn't Starfleet have all that material?

 > **ADISLO**: Captain, Hars Adislo, we met at the Nel Bato Conference last year. Did you ever have a chance to read my paper on thermionic transconductance?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Would you excuse me?

And they also find science unspeakably silly, something for other people to do.

I also need to stress that we have only hit the ten-minute mark.  I might not make it through the post, at this rate, let alone two films...

 > **DOUGHERTY**: He's not acknowledging any Starfleet protocols. Not responding to any of our hails.

You might recognize the admiral as [Anthony Zerbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Zerbe), who made consistent appearances on the large and small screen from the early 1960s and only really tapering off about a decade ago.

 > **DOUGHERTY**: None. Now he's holding our people hostage down there.

You could've led with that...

 > **DOUGHERTY**: We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area the Briar Patch. It took us a day to reach a location where we could even get a signal to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.

Do the films have any original features to them?  I ask, because this plot point seems cribbed directly from [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}).

 > **PICARD**: I'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows. I'm going to ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four-one on our way to the Goren system.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: They are in opposite directions, sir.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Are they...?

Apparently, "I knew I should've made that left turn at Albuquerque" will work at the court-martial for ignoring his orders and putting his crew in danger unnecessarily *again*.

 > **RU'AFO**: I never should have let you talk me into that duck blind in the first place. Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be.

The credits largely did this for me, but you presumably recognize the commander as [F. Murray Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Murray_Abraham).

 > **DOUGHERTY**: I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation.

Did he say that he wants everybody in the Federation to...get facelifts?

For clarity, I think that I really want to ask that question honestly, because I find it less offensive than utterly baffling.  And it *really* sounds like he said that.

 > **RIKER**: Half a century ago they conquered two primitive races, the Tarlac and the Ellora, and then integrated them into their culture as a labor class. Look at this. The Son'a are known to have produced vast quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white. Their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytc subspace weapons outlawed by the second Khitomer Accords.
 >
 > **TROI**: Why would we be involved with these people?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Good question.

How do they not follow this?

Relevant to many **Next Generation** episodes, Starfleet always seems interested in getting their hands on outlawed weapons.  But more overtly and relevant to **Deep Space Nine**, they keep making a big deal about the Dominion keeping their army under control by breeding them with a dependency on exactly that narcotic, meaning that a second source of it would give those who don't see the war with the Federation as just---and we'll meet quite a few---some backing to recruit more.  And as I recall, at least one episode centers on trying and failing to synthesize it for that purpose.  And episodes such as [*The High Ground*]({% post_url 2023-07-20-high-ground %}) have showed us that the Federation will work with pretty much anybody who can supply them with something valuable.

That question answered, we can move to the important question:  Do they really want to sell us on the lazy Riker-Troi romance again, with this creepy shoulder-fondling nonsense?  She doesn't know where he sticks that shoulder.  And it seems all the creepier given that we spent seven years and two films with this crew where everybody seems terrified to come into physical contact.

 > **PICARD**: I don't know how they do it on Deep Space Nine, but on the Enterprise, we still report for duty on time.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: We'll skip the court-martial this time. Picard out.

Well, he *asked* Worf to come with him, and you probably don't need a tactical officer on the way over to this illegal military action, so maybe back off and let the man sleep if he needs to?  Oh, right.  That would mean showing some respect for Worf, and we can't have that.

Wait, we only hit the fifteen-minute mark?  I hate to keep harping on the time-stamps, here, but it feels like I've had this mess in my field of vision for hours, but still somehow have almost an hour and a half left.

 > **LAFORGE**: The torque sensors are out of alignment by twelve microns. You could hear that?
 >
 > **PICARD**: When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron misalignment.

Not only does this sound extremely fake, but the reaction shot tells us that they don't buy it, either.  And speaking of the believability, do the torque sensors sit on the bridge with them, measuring all the...twisting things?  I ask, because it seems even less plausible if he claims to hear something a few rooms away, as if filing prissy complaints about the suspected pea under his mattress.

 > **DANIELS**: Excuse me, sir. The Son'a ship with Admiral Dougherty aboard has entered tracking range.

It looks Grady Fletcher didn't quit angrily after Picard sent him to his death in [**First Contact**]({% post_url 2025-12-25-first-contact-2 %})...

 > **PICARD**: Straighten your baldric, Commander. On screen.

Can we get to any part of this film that doesn't feel like watching surly teenagers taking out their frustrations by becoming hall monitors?

 > **PICARD**: This was too important for the *Enterprise* to be on the sidelines, Admiral.

Ah, again, it offends them to have anybody's attention focused somewhere away from them.

 > **PICARD**: If our first attempt to capture Data fails, I will terminate him. I should be the one to do it. I'm his Captain and his friend.

You might notice that he fought for Data's civil liberties, but now seems almost excited at the prospect of an extrajudicial execution.

 > **PICARD**: {% emoji musical notes %} Come out, come out, wherever you are. {% emoji musical notes %}
 >
 > **WORF**: Sir?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Oh, that's something that my mother...

Surely, Worf has questions about Picard singing it to the shuttle like a child, and not the origin of the sentiment, right?

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
 >
 > **WORF**: No sir. I have not had a chance to meet all the new crew-members since I have been back.
 >
 > **PICARD**: They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century.

I need to point out yet another instance of Picard going *way* out of his way to make Worf feel like an outsider, here.  I mean, *I* knew who he meant, because I enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan, and because I understand how writers structure film dialogue.  But he has done nothing but complain about Worf not living up to his arbitrary standards, *and* he grew up with Russian parents, so it seems fairly likely that he happens to have gotten excited about operettas from---2364 in the first season, plus seven seasons, plus about five years to get us to 2376 or so, minus 1878 when the operetta of relevance hit the stage---almost exactly five hundred years ago.

For comparison, do you know Alberti?  No, I doubt that you do, because he wrote music in Italy in the 1520s, and none of those features have anything to do with this conversation.

 > **PICARD**: Data was rehearsing a production of H.M.S. Pinafore just before he left. {% emoji musical notes %} *A British tar is a soaring soul, as free as a mountain bird. His energetic first should be ready to resist a dictatorial word*. {% emoji musical notes %} Sing, Worf, sing! {% emoji musical notes %} *His nose should pant*... {% emoji musical notes %}

You can see as well as I can from the screen that this comes from *A British Tar* from [**H.M.S. Pinafore**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore).

Anyway, I appreciate that Worf wants no part of this.  I admittedly started looking around for airlocks to jump out of, myself, to get away from it, before realizing that my living room doesn't have any...

 > **SOJEF**: As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.

Somehow, it doesn't surprise me that they roll their eyes at the request to not carry around their weapons.

 > **PICARD**: Our people have a strict policy of non-interference in other cultures. It's our Prime Directive.

...Unless they can think of a flimsy excuse to interfere.

 > **ANIJ**: Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.

Wait until she finds out about the part where they infiltrate respected institutions to compromise leaders in order to sway public opinion in their favor before making [*First Contact*]({% post_url 2024-02-15-first-contact %})...

 > **PICARD**: I apologize for our intrusion.

It almost feels like we should celebrate Picard apologizing for anything, really, and recognizing that he could have done better.

 > **PICARD**: ...and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal.

Ah, he already doesn't care.  Gotcha.  Yeah, that checks out...

 > **RIKER**: I need a little counseling.
 >
 > **TROI**: Well, there's a first time for everything.

Has he *not* needed it until now?  I feel like the sexual harassment, the petty rivalries, and the massive Oedipal complex all speak against this as a "first time."

 > **RIKER**: I think I'm having a midlife crisis.
 >
 > **TROI**: I believe you.

I feel like the midlife crisis started sometime during the second season, but sure...

 > **RIKER**: What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher. Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they made?

First, and you know that I don't say this lightly...gross.  Everything about this scene makes my skin crawl, possibly due to this coming out of nowhere---Riker didn't seem to care about this relationship at all until "rivals" started taking an interest in Troi---and possibly because they have no chemistry together.

Second, this feels emblematic of everything wrong with this crew, that they want to **Groundhog Day** their way through life, retaking the test every time that they don't get the result that they want, instead of building a better future.  I've mentioned this before regarding Picard's insistence that humanity has perfected itself.  But they don't see putting in effort for a better future as remotely valuable.  Not speeding around the galaxy presents too much inconvenience.  Racism might still prove useful.  Fighting for Data's right to self-determination outside Starfleet takes too much sustained effort.  Repairing relationships seems much harder than turning back the clock.

 > **LAFORGE**: In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
 >
 > **PICARD**: And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku that we were a threat. Are the implants bothering you?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: No, I'm all right. I'm just tired.

For the first part of this, it seems worth considering the possibility that Data recognizes the *Enterprise* crew as "anyone who might try to take advantage of" him, because they do exactly that, repeatedly.  And Picard, predictably, blows off the implication as some sort of sorting error.

For the other part of it, I can't help but read it---recalling that [*Loud As a Whisper*]({% post_url 2022-12-22-loud-as-whisper %}) revealed that a decent doctor could regrow his eyes without his disability---as their "upgrading" La Forge's prosthetics but only in such a way that he suffers for the convenience, the "implants bothering" him.  I mean, the writers definitely made that choice; I only question whether the writing choice represents an in-universe decision.

 > **PICARD**: It is nothing personal, Data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology.
 >
 > **DATA**: I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks.

I can't help noticing that Picard doesn't apologize, here, for his callousness.  Data, without stating it outright, makes it clear that, no, this actually does feel pretty personal, because it literally applies to his person.  But Picard hand-waves that away to keep walking.

 > **RIKER**: His future in Starfleet could depend on it.

Once again, we see that, if Data steps out of line, he faces a far steeper penalty for his actions, due to (in effect) his ethnicity.

 > **ARTIM**: Won't he rust?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Ha, no.

Oh, Picard has started treating *everyone* like he does Worf, laughing at the kid for asking about rusting, like he's supposed to know how much iron Data has in his body.

 > **DATA**: The vessel is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.

...Do we *not* want to talk about how Data dumped out half their reservoir for no particularly compelling reason?  And he doesn't even have some [nonsense story about wildfires](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-03/trump-administration-dams-release-water) to excuse the terrible idea.

 > **PICARD**: What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and force-fields.
 >
 > **ANIJ**: I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is why would anyone want to create one of our village?

Somebody finally called him out on his blatant mansplaining...

 > **ANIJ**: Deceive us?
 >
 > **PICARD**: To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in the village. Wake up the next morning on this flying holodeck transported en masse. In a few days, you're relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

And now we have started cribbing from [*Homeward*]({% post_url 2025-08-21-homeward %}), even if Picard seems to not want to talk about how his logs probably gave the people behind this plot the idea.

 > **PICARD**: Don't panic.
 >
 > **ANIJ**: I've been shot at. Thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us. What's there to panic about?

Also, what about this looks like *panic*?  She stayed afloat for about thirty seconds, then called for help.  Given Picard's history with Crusher, I assume that her gender led him to assume panic.

 > **DATA**: In the event of a water landing, I have been designed to serve as a flotation device.

Please stop...

 > **PICARD**: Gorch?
 >
 > **DATA**: A pimple, sir.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Oh...well, it's...hardly noticeable.

We get it.  Nobody there likes Worf.  The characters don't like him.  The writers don't like him.  Can we move on?

 > **RIKER**: Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?

Apparently, we can't move on.  But hey, all the times that I *considered* calling Riker an insult like "butt-face" somehow manifested in Riker doing it himself, so celebrate the small wins, I guess...

 > **RIKER**: Klingons never do anything small, do you?

Please stop.

 > **PICARD**: Computer. Music. No, no, not that. Something Latin.

How would the computer know *that*, when he spends all his time listening to the super-villain classical station?

 > **PICARD**: It may not come to that. Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy want to keep it a secret. Not only from you, but from my people as well. I don't intend to let them.

I swear, if this doofus tries to solve this with a strongly worded e-mail, I will riot...

 > **PICARD**: You give me more credit than I deserve. Well, of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be? But some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a large one. I'd hoped we had learned from our mistakes, but it seems that some of us haven't. This is extraordinary craftsmanship.

He literally tried to do exactly that thing in [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}), and again a few weeks later in [*Preemptive Strike*]({% post_url 2025-11-06-preemptive-strike %}), showing that *he* didn't learn any lesson the first time.  Does he not watch the show?

Also, I feel really uncomfortable with his characterization of this as a problem of size.  For example, 1960s South Africa had about three million white citizens, out of a total of roughly sixteen million.  The government, at that time, began the forced relocation of at least three-and-a-half million Black citizens to segregated neighborhoods, many of which overlapped with or became the so-called [Bantustans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantustan), with the intent of cutting off their South African citizenship.  Would that not qualify as a dark chapter, because a small ruling class imposed it on a larger group, almost certainly intending to expand to the other ten million non-white citizens so that they could become the majority?  I assume that we could find other examples, arguably including the current administration of the United States.

 > **PICARD**: A perfect moment?

 > **PICARD**: Seeing my home planet from space for the first time.

Personally, I might've gone with the Nexus from **Generations**, literally that metaphor as a physical phenomenon, but this wonder---which he has never mentioned in all the time that we've known him---would explain why he keeps forcing that experience on pre-technological women, from [*Justice*]({% post_url 2022-07-07-justice %}) through **First Contact**...

 > **ANIJ**: I just haven't got around to it yet. I wonder if you're aware of the trust you engender, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...

Seriously?  *Picard* engendering trust?  The guy who openly rolled his eyes at a request to not walk around a random village armed to the teeth?  The guy who claimed that Data posed no threat shortly before Data dumped their reservoir?  The guy who admitted that his government probably has an ethnic cleansing campaign in the offing?  And that limits itself to the highlights of what Anij would've actually seen with her own eyes.  So much for this group's perceptive abilities, I guess...

 > **LAFORGE**: It may not last and if it doesn't, I just wanted, before we go, I... You know, I've never seen a sunrise, at least not the way you see them.

First, it took these people almost *a decade* to say that, you know, maybe we can have a scene where the Black guy doesn't have anything to distract from his face.

Second, this directly references his monologue in [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}), making this the second film to refer to it.

 > **PICARD**: I won't let you move them, Admiral. I will take this to the Federation Council.

{% emoji cursing %} {% sfx John rioting %} {% emoji despise %}

(┛ಠ_ಠ)┛彡┻━┻

C'mon, now.

I promise you that I meant the "strongly worded e-mail" prediction as a joke.  Seriously, when somebody says that they don't intend to let an organization keep something secret, *I* assume that they mean that they'll take it to the public, not quietly threaten to tattle one level up the chain of command and then go home.

 > **DOUGHERTY**: I'm acting on orders from the Federation Council.
 >
 > **PICARD**: How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive?

I mean... {% emoji person shrugging %}

Does he not understand how laws work?

Also, if nothing else has convinced you in the three-and-a-half years that I have slogged through with this crew, this seems to make it explicit that this century's Federation doesn't have any principles other than exploiting people.  They approved an ethnic cleansing campaign so that they can gentrify the village and let the elites live forever.

Sure, he (later) *says* that the whatever will help billions, but he also makes it clear that they'll have a finite supply that they'll need to share with the facelift-people.  That adds up to this only benefiting a handful of people, and once you violate ethical lines and limit the beneficiaries, you know where that path ends up.

 > **DOUGHERTY**: The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this planet. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring them to their natural evolution.

Personally, if I wanted to defend this mess, *I* would've said that it doesn't apply because they have (and gave up) technology at least as advanced as the Federation's, which they have often at least hinted made the difference in whether it applies.

However, since the admiral brought it up, we once again have this unhinged appeal to the idea that the universe works best with everybody in their "natural" state...which they judge from their faster-than-light spaceships.  I believe that we first saw it in [*Pen Pals*]({% post_url 2023-03-02-pen-pals %}), when the crew debated whether the natives had some destiny to die, and we saw it most recently in [*Emergence*]({% post_url 2025-10-30-emergence %}), with Crusher opining that some animals have a "purpose."

 > **PICARD**: Who the Hell are we to determine the next course of evolution for these people?

Doesn't he do exactly that whenever he insists that the Prime Directive forbids him from saving lives?  I realize that this gets into [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) territory (and the anti-abortion nonsense that embraced it for a long time), but *Homeward* did start with him planning to watch and record the violent death of an entire civilization, which feels a heck of a lot like making such a determination.

 > **PICARD**: Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.

In all fairness, one could say the same about their partners...

 > **DOUGHERTY**: On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an Empire. We can handle the Son'a. I'm not worried about that.

Interesting choices of good outcomes, no?  None of the countries running primarily on oil money have the best track record on human rights, for example, to say nothing of the damage to the environment and individuals that the industry has done.  I mean, even ignoring what has come out *since* the film came out, this story feels suspiciously similar to the [Osage murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Indian_murders), violence to drive out hundreds of natives because somebody wants the resources there.  And speaking of damage to the environment, we might also connect that warp drive comment with the plot of *Force of Nature*.

 > **PICARD**: Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.

I guess that we really can't mention the Romulans without claiming that they present some existential threat to everything good in the galaxy, despite never providing any evidence backing that claim.

 > **PICARD**: Admiral, delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.

I love Picard's recurring "your team probably phoned it in and never came back from their lunch break" attitude. {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **PICARD**: The Ba'ku. We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded. It's an attack upon its very soul. And it will destroy the Ba'ku just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.

Does he not remember his complicity in prior events exactly like this?  I ask, because unlike talking to the prospective victim earlier, it feels like that would bolster his argument.  He has lived this, and allegedly learned an important lesson...that he needed to relearn a few times before it stuck.

Not mentioning it makes it seem like he only cares because he ~~wants to sleep with Donna Murphy~~ put a face on the problem.

Regardless of his ineptitude, assuming that this doesn't actually stem from some plan to bed what's-her-name, when did he start caring about people?  He literally kicked off this film by refusing to mediate peace because he wanted to go grave-robbing and groaning at foreign customs, let alone all the horrible things that we've watched him propose over seven seasons and two films, some of which (as noted) sound exactly like what Dougherty has in mind with less prospective benefit.  Now, with no reason for character growth since *except* meeting a comely woman willing to flatter him than I ever would, he suddenly cares oh-so-deeply about a (non-French) heritage.

Anyway, we'll break here---technically after the pointless bit on the other ship where they give up on tricking the locals into leaving---to pick back up next week with Picard planning a civilian excursion, pretty close to the halfway mark.

## Conclusions

We get some music, I guess.

### The Good

Picard potentially (finally) recognizes ethnic cleansing as a bad thing, though he casts it as an underdog story.

### The Bad

Picard, at least, either can't dress himself without help or has his female flunkies do that menial labor for him.  We also see sexism in that Picard's interest in dance attracts far less attention than Crusher's did.  And he seems desperate to talk down to his love interest, even as she makes it clear that she won't stand for it.

We see an absolute disdain for a foreign culture.  They feign difficulty with the language and insult their eating habits and dietary needs, while dismissing their customs as silly.  They believe that they have a right to disassemble cultural sites to pack museums.  And they find it laughable that some people don't want them walking around armed while they generally act like nothing there matters.

Likewise, they dismiss diplomacy as not worth their time.  They do the same thing with scientific work.

We continue to see the Borg and the Romulans used as perpetual enemies to fear, even as the Federation faces an active invasion by a powerful force.

They also repeatedly dump on Worf, almost obsessively, even asking him along *to* insult him.  Data, similarly, continues to not have actual civil liberties, if he transgresses any social boundaries, and seems to recognize his colleagues as exploiting him on a subconscious level, while Picard dismisses his concerns.

Starfleet has bizarre priorities, apparently not keeping records on its officers, needing to call their immediate commanders.  They seem to think that frightening people presents a bigger crisis than hostages.  And Picard seems to at least imply that he can get away with defying orders and endangering the crew if he pretends to think that his pet project can happen on the way.  Maybe they want to supply everybody with plastic surgery.  And they don't seem to understand strategic needs.

We see the return of competing to feel superior, with Picard's alleged super-hearing and the need to get the ship to the center of the action.

They continue to dismiss the Prime Directive for any reasons that they can scrounge up, while also framing it in almost religious ideas of destiny and purpose.  And the Federation makes it clear that they only consider it Prime when it doesn't inconvenience them.

Therapy continues to serve as a punchline or a pretext to have other conversations.

Picard, at least, ignores the failed ethnic cleansing campaigns that he led, in order to claim some moral high ground.

We see a naïve approach to whistleblowing, where they only report wrong-doing to the culprit's immediate superior---or really only threaten to do that---then give up.

### The Weird

The Federation still doesn't appear to have custom clothing.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we...I don't know, probably insult Worf more or try to get us excited about Riker shaving, maybe more "singing," in the other half of **Insurrection**.  You probably know better than I do, at the moment.
