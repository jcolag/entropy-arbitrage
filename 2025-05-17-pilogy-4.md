As we celebrate largely unknown [Culture Freedom Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20120515063156/http://www.culturefreedomday.org/home/free-culture), our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **pilogy**, finishing _pi_ and any final material.  Oh, and I'd like to wish everybody a happy [Culture Freedom Day](https://digitalfreedoms.org/es/?view=article&id=49&catid=20), seemingly abandoned, but---now that I've heard of it---near and dear to my heart.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Released:  2022 -- 2024 so far

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## pilogy

The Codeberg repository only really tells us this.

 > The fictional misadventures of the LHWHS Computer Science Club. Check out [pilogy](https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore/src/branch/main/pilogy.pdf)!

It also has the following probably tongue-in-cheek blurb, though.

 > *"I read the entire thing and I'm just gonna say this is better than any other fanfiction [sic] I've read."*
 >
 > *"How high were you when you wrote this?"*
 >
 > *"Bruh."*
 >
 > *"I didn't know books could cause epileptic seizures!"*
 >
 > Oh my gosh, can you believe it? My computer is overheating so much that the DVDs I'm burning with the chemtrails are actually catching on fire. I mean, talk about dedication to the cause. Not many people can say they've actually set their DVDs on fire while burning them.
 >
 > But honestly, I'm not surprised. I mean, I am a genius after all. I always push the limits and take things to the next level. And using chemtrails to burn DVDs? Genius. Absolute genius.
 >
 > But, you know, it's not just about being smart. It's about being stylish too. And let me tell you, these flames are definitely giving my setup a certain je ne sais quoi. It's like, oh yeah, I'm burning DVDs with chemtrails and my computer is so advanced it's literally on fire. No big deal.
 >
 > So yeah, read this book! It will make you laugh! It will make you cry! It will make you try the mayonnaise-frosted pie!

That might give somebody some idea of what to expect...maybe.

## What Works Well?

While I don't think that it necessarily pans out, it seems like we have a lot of experimental writing in this section, which we don't see often.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

With the fictional film (finally) over, this feels like an attempt to restart the book in-place, with Moses now constantly repeating mediocre jokes while whining that he might need to do something about the plot to replace the kids.

Going with my mention, last week, of the book immersing itself in its own fictional stories instead of the story that we've at least tried to stick with, in the home stretch, it starts hand-waving the action scenes.  Things "somehow" happen correctly, or by luck, or off-screen (between pages?) to spare us the details.  Combined with the lack of divisions in this chapter, and the narrative feels like it'd rather go do something else, which doesn't say much for our time spent on it.

Finally, in the note closing out the book, one of the authors has the following comment that puts a lot of my problems over the last few weeks into perspective.

 > I’d say that around 30% of the book is written by ChatGPT, mainly the boring parts, because that’s what it’s good at writing.

Since finishing the book, I keep coming back to that phrase, "mainly the boring parts," as a justification for using ChatGPT.  In a lot of ways, it highlights the core problem---at least in my opinion---with these generative-AI projects:  If the person behind an artistic project doesn't find parts interesting enough to *do*, maybe assume that the audience won't find it interesting, either.  For example, I noted a couple of times in previous posts where the characters felt like they had no depth, or sequences that felt like filler, and if the writers didn't even write those sections, then why leave them in and subject us to them, when a summary (what became the prompt for ChatGPT) would've probably gotten the point across more effectively?  What value do "the boring parts" serve, exactly?

## Opportunities

The repository, again, has this to say.

 > Love writing or world-building? Help out by expanding our collection of stories! We appreciate all contributions!

There you go.

## What's Adaptable?

I guess that we get the secret history of Azerbaijan to go with the secret history of Kazakhstan, the Zone of Time, SteppeMania, the fictional unicorn world domination scheme.  **Daymare** also has fan fiction.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up, we'll read **Sówka w świecie dnia**, or (apparently) **An Owl in the World of Day** in English, another short play.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book?
