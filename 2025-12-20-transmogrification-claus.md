This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to **The Transmogrification of Mr. Claus**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Transmogrification of Mr. Claus

The album describes itself as follows.

 > This album, film, libretto, and audiobook that you're holding in your hand is an exploration of the last days of Santa Claus as we know him, charting his bumbling and heroic exploits as he simultaneously contracts and nearly spreads the plague along his expansive, gift-giving route AND single-handedly rids us of that particular strain of virus once and for all by virtue of his thudding, aged, tender, immutable heart.
 >
 > Along the way, he grows a few arms, rips Chevy Chase a new one, explains why the polar ice caps are melting, has his blood slurped up by an arctic fox, dances to calypso music while blackout drunk, gets his cabin destroyed by riderless stallions, and that's just for starters...a little milk and cookie appetizer if you will.
 >
 > Along the way you'll be entranced by a rich ensemble of familiar characters including Mrs. Claus, Rudolph, the elves, Peanut the dog, Martin Short, a deranged murderer on the loose in Cleveland, OH, wormwood and mugwort, Harry of Harry's Bar notoriety, shitting mice, Lord Invader, Lee Hazlewood, tenement housing in the 1940s Detroit, the San Antonio River, the fox in the hen house, and an anthropomorphic Sun that nearly slaughters every human being on Planet Earth, and many more!
 >
 > Joining this array of some of the biggest names in the business are Zack Kouns, who wrote the script and serves as the narrator, and Rick Weaver, who composed the score, both of whom figure prominently in this wholesome little psychodrama / feel-good family comedy for the whole family, provided that everybody in your family is over the age of 18.
 >
 > Thank you for inviting us into your hearts and home as we answer that timeless question
 >
 > "Is zat you, Santa Claus?"
 >
 > The answer is:
 >
 > "You betcha, pal. And I'm here to save your butt and also endanger the survival of your species but most importantly I will save your lives so let's forget aaaallll about that other part."
 >
 > All of us at Team Capra Productions would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays and offer you a reminder that no man is a failure who has friends. 

I don't know how seriously I should take the mention of a film and libretto.  Neither seem accessible through the album, so I'll work entirely from the album.

## What Works Well?

I'd call this one of the highest quality productions that we've seen.  The music has some moments that sound cheap, but the recording and the musical backing otherwise feel solid.

I also can't fault the story's ambitions.  It may not always hold together, but it certainly puts the effort into trying to imagine an ending to a folk-tale.

Finally, it seems a bit facile, but the moral that only tenderness and affection can save our species *mostly* feels appropriate to everything, and not out of line for we in the audience.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The story rambles a lot, often wandering so far off the presumed plot that a mention of "Santa" feels like it comes out of nowhere.  But even when it doesn't get that far off, it sounds like it chooses the phrasing for the rhythm, rather than anything related to the content.

Similarly, the ending seems to abruptly fall apart, trying to bridge the story to the real world without giving us any reason---narrative or otherwise---to buy into the twist.

## Opportunities

They have a community page and a merchandise page on Bandcamp, but I don't see more than that.

## What's Adaptable?

In terms of named, discrete entities, I believe that we only see Harry's Bar, though that may well exist.  More broadly, we have Santa Claus sprouting an increasing number of arms and the anthropomorphic Sun.  Beyond that, a lot of the references actually exist, and I assume that extends to the Claus family's new identities.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read **Norte**, a (Brazilian) Portuguese novel, or draft of part of a novel, maybe.  To lighten the load for the holidays, we'll split the short piece across two weeks, next week from the start through *27*.  If you reach *3*, then you've gone too far.  No, I don't understand the numbering, either, yet.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
