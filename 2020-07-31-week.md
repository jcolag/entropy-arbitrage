As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1287735489772978177) [What Coronavirus Job Losses Reveal About Racism in America](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus-unemployment/) from ProPublica

 > The classic fact about Black unemployment, is that it’s been two times the white rate since we started measuring it.

Not *quite* related, but [As of today, only 4 Black CEOs remain in the Fortune 500](https://www.fastcompany.com/90530569/as-of-today-only-4-black-ceos-remain-in-the-fortune-500) from Fast Company

 > ...a woman accused him of pretending to be a photographer to lure her into a relationship.

I don't link these because I think they're literally related, because a CEO leaving after his scheme for manipulating women is discovered isn't "unemployment."  But it's worth looking at where the ethical bar is for different people.  It's sleazy, but it's hard to imagine a wealthy White man being asked to step down because he lied about *not* being a Fortune 500 CEO to impress someone he found attractive.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1288097122374627328) [What You Need To Know About The Battle of Portland](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/) from Bellingcat

 > Riots are assumed to be life-threatening situations, and so the PPB increasingly started making riot declarations to justify their use of tear gas.

And incidentally, [NYPD Disappeared Black Lives Matter Protesters Into Detention for Days at a Time. Lawmakers Want to End the Practice.](https://theintercept.com/2020/07/22/nypd-protesters-detention/) from The Intercept

 > The bill would oblige all police departments in New York State to either bring an arrested individual before a judge within 24 hours or immediately release them upon request.

I wrote a little about the history of the term riot [a little over a month ago]({% post_url 2020-06-21-words %}#riot-vs-uprising) and the first article is a perfect illustration.  The second article makes the point that the "secret police" aren't exactly a new phenomenon, for the non-White people in the country.

 > My fellow Americans, out of this experience, may we all better understand and appreciate our Constitution, strive harder to preserve it, and make a fresh start at restoring the trust between the branches of government. For, in America as 200 years ago, the people still rule.

 > ...feature different captions, which are tailored to issues like religious freedom and abortion and not policing issues.

This is repulsive and, if we still had a functioning [Federal Election Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission), rather than a refusal to nominate for *half* the vacant seats, there would be consequences for this.  Perhaps allowing someone who campaigns dishonestly isn't the right person to empower a board that monitors campaign integrity.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1288822904784736256) [Liberian fishing communities stand up to Chinese supertrawlers](https://globalvoices.org/2020/07/22/liberian-fishing-communities-stand-up-to-chinese-supertrawlers/) from Global Voices

 > Fishing without a license comes with a fine of up to $1,000,000 United States dollars under Liberian Fisheries Regulations, but illegal fishing has long persisted in Liberian waters due to a lack of monitoring and policing.

Keep in mind that the ["Somali pirates"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia) were fishermen whose livelihoods were destroyed by illegal international fishing.  So, this is an improvement and we'll ideally see good results from this simpler, safer action.

 > ...lower than normal levels of proteins involved in various aspects of growth, higher levels of proteins resulting from breakdown of the lining of the gut, and hyperactivation of the gut immune system.

Some estimates suggest that as high as one percent of cells in the human body are part of the [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota), and presumably the other forms of microscopic life in there are also significant, so it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the little guys are found to be increasingly important to our health.

###### Vladimir Lenin

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Is it time for Netflix subscribers to go on strike?](https://qz.com/1883697/is-it-time-for-netflix-subscribers-to-go-on-strike/) from Quartz

 > The researchers call this form of collective action a “data strike,” and say it might help average internet users gain some leverage against major tech companies. While they used Netflix as an example, the tactic could also work against other giants like Facebook, Google, or Amazon.

While it's a fun idea, this sort of activity doesn't work particularly well, simply because the companies already have your data.  You'd need to find some way of poisoning the new data to make an impact, which is much more difficult.  That said, leaving a service isn't bad.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Do stone tools put humans in America 30K years ago?](https://www.futurity.org/first-humans-america-dna-stone-tools-2407462/) from Futurity

 > Because although we searched very thoroughly for human DNA in the samples we gathered during the 10 days we spent at the Chiquihuite Cave, there were no human traces to be found.

This is an odd story, ancient tools with no evidence of the people who might have left them.  There are some interesting possibilities, but most don't hold up under scrutiny.
