As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1556626782534529024) [Who Is Collecting Data from Your Car?](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2022/07/27/who-is-collecting-data-from-your-car) from The Markup

 > ...from the car manufacturer to companies known as “vehicle data hubs” and on through the connected vehicle data marketplace.

After decades of gutting public transportation and dragging its feet on introducing new convenience and safety technologies, the automotive industry has also decided to sell out its customers, who can't generally afford to opt out.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1556989674081615878) [Fueled by virtually unrestricted social media access, white nationalism is on the rise and attracting violent young white men](https://theconversation.com/fueled-by-virtually-unrestricted-social-media-access-white-nationalism-is-on-the-rise-and-attracting-violent-young-white-men-186896) from The Conversation

 > ...the number of arrests of white supremacists and other racially motivated extremists has almost tripled since he took office in 2017.

If you read here regularly, you know why this has expanded through social media:  The hatred and fear of white supremacists makes for high-quality "engagement" with the system, wearing people out so that they look at ads without much skepticism.

 > It is intolerable that a silly fool, with nothing but empty birth to boast of, should in his insolence array himself in the merits of others, and vaunt an honor which does not belong to him.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1557352313605369856) [Americans tend not to know about AI in journalism](https://www.futurity.org/ai-journalism-2778042-2/) from Futurity

 > Today, AI machines designed to perform the communicator role are generating news content independent of humans.

In other words, expect the quality of journalism to continue to drop, especially political reporting.  While human journalists can get caught up with the "team sports" angle to politics, and that sells, AI can *only* write stories from that perspective, because no editor will supply their software data that talks about how political policies harm different groups or what alternatives exist.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1557714197911306240) [Advocacy groups in the Americas focus on tackling rising surveillance technology](https://globalvoices.org/2022/08/05/advocacy-groups-in-the-americas-focus-on-tackling-rising-surveillance-technology/) from Global Voices

 > The report also highlights companies behind these tools that they consider “dangerous” and the policies and practices governments are putting in place through which people’s rights are being undermined.

I like projects along these lines, especially if they can bridge the gap to explain why ordinary people should care.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1558076083030745088) [‘Very Inspirational’: MAGA Crowd Swoons For Strongman Against ‘Mixed-Race’ Society](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zzpx/cpac-viktor-orban-speech) from VICE News

 > Even before Orbán’s speech on Thursday, CPAC attendees were willing to shrug off his “mixed-race” comments.

You notice that the party doesn't *quite* think that it can get away with open white Christian nationalism, so it imports them to test the waters.

 > The rose-garden, which today is full of flowers, when tomorrow thou wouldst pluck a rose, may not afford one.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why some kinds of birds are more intelligent](https://www.futurity.org/more-intelligent-birds-2776572-2/) from Futurity

 > ...the team found that the species with the higher numbers of neurons in the pallium were also likely to be the most innovative.

I don't have much to say about this.  Animal cognition just interests me.
