This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Little Dig Game**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Content Advisories:  Death, fear, section requiring rapid interaction

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Little Dig Game

The game's repository page describes it as follows.

> This is a little game about working for a company that consumes planets to extract value.
>
> You're in charge of sending workers to the planet to wander around and collect resources.
>
> ...
>
> Beware of interlopers.

I rarely tell you *whether* to try something out, but...yeah, go do that with this one.

## What Works Well?

Your tastes may vary, but even after playing a handful of times, I still chuckle at the ultra-capitalist satire.  You not only see it in the quasi-conversations, but in the choices of technologies, simultaneously trying to squeeze the labor force for everything it has and talking in breathless excitement about "hardened hats" keeping the workers alive long enough to produce more.

Likewise, the path that the story takes feels satisfying.  The story that we start with would have made a fun quick game, but the twist doesn't necessarily *improve* the story, but builds on it in a way that makes it more approachable, and maybe even has a small lesson in it.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

My biggest objection probably comes from the fact that, for a game, you really only have one significant opportunity to affect the outcome.  And that opportunity comes without warning and requires your hand-eye coordination *and* technology to get itself in order.

And I mention this mostly because I want to draw attention to the joke that some people might miss, but I wish that the configuration option had some significant effect.  I needed to dig through code *and* assets to confirm that a difference does, in fact, exist...

## Opportunities

Activity on the repository seems to have stopped a few weeks ago, but it did see quite a bit of activity up through May.

## What's Adaptable?

For such a small game, you get the mining company, the rather extensive list of technologies, and a couple of characters.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll read **Grey Sky**, an ongoing comic.  It looks like enough material in (I believe) an ongoing story that we'll split it into two posts, covering fifty pages apiece.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
