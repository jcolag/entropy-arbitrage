Going out later than I wanted, this morning, but...

{% cw #1 &mdash; References to the (cited) positions and occasional quotes of terrible and, yes, *weird* people, to make the relevant points. %}

![A light-colored cat scrunching down to fit their head and forelegs under a tiny step-stool, while the rest of their body spills out](/blog/assets/3316028491_0a55965485_o.png "Not my cat, not my problem...")

Funny thing, I initially tried to write a post complaining about the use of the word "weird" to mock Republicans---I *frequently* identify as weird, myself, so it felt like a problem---and then I realized the flaw in my thinking and deleted that draft, deciding that I had nothing worth saying on the topic.  Then I read [*In Praise of the Weird*](https://theconversation.com/in-praise-of-the-weird-236370), which says a lot of the same wrong-headed things that I planned, almost verbatim.

 > While I get why both sides are hurling weird bombs at each other, I’m nevertheless not on board with all the “weird shaming.” It isn’t just hypocritical for each party to claim to speak on behalf of the forgotten and marginalized while mockingly calling the other side weird. It’s also deeply regressive.

At that point, and after seeing similar sentiments still circulating on my corner of social media, I realized that other people still shared my now-dismissed idea, and also how *conservative* it felt to dismiss this as a kind of slur, parallel to "the R-word (racist) is the real racism."  Or, more precisely if you enjoy satire, [*Guy Who Says Slurs Draws the Line at ‘Weird’*](https://reductress.com/post/guy-who-says-slurs-draws-the-line-at-weird/).

I want to make the points that this doesn't work as a slur, it *does* lump us in a minor way with terrible people as many descriptors will, and that it works so well for a few critical reasons.

## My Vanishing Opposition

Like I said, I've used the word "weird" to describe myself for most of my life, and I have no trouble with that.  At times, I've considered it a point of pride.  Hell, go back far enough, and I've even spent some years trying to find ways to come off as weirder, mostly steps that I cringe at in retrospect[^1].  I don't know why, since I didn't have much interest in drawing attention to myself.

[^1]:  As a clear example for that unfortunate category, I bought and listened to almost every low-budget "world music" CD that I could find.  On the bright side, it gave me a more well-rounded view on music than if I had followed what my peers considered popular, and so can enjoy Voice of America's [**Music Time in Africa**](https://www.voaafrica.com/musictimeafrica) in ways that I might not otherwise, for example.  But less bright, I spent time thinking that listening to music from the Global South qualified as an aberration that made me unique, and not a thing that billions of people have as a routine part of their culture.

{% pull our interests don't form our personalities. %}

Over time, I recovered from wanting to "seem" weird to caring less about what people think of me.  Partly, this comes from society changing, in that heavy computer usage, an interest in characters from comic books, a certain academic style, and so forth, have gone mainstream.  Partly, it comes from needing to prioritize acting less terrible to people.  I still have a blatant soft spot for oddities, but our interests don't form our personalities, so weirdness without any substance behind it really has all the impact of a fancy hat, enough to get you some attention and not much else.  If you missed that last piece, don't worry, because I'll almost certainly come back to it later.

Anyway, as I said at the top of the post, I originally disliked the idea of "weird" as an insult, thinking of it as childish and bullying.  But as I saw it work, I started to realize **why** it worked so well, and the distinction between the Tim Walz comment and bullying.  More importantly, I don't see other people talking about it, for some reason, only the same naïve idea that we should treat it like an insult.

## Standard Caveats

I do want to mention that this pseudo-attack does have its drawbacks, so I don't want to imply that I recommend it or feel the need to start using it, personally.

For example, it sounds lazy, to my ear, hearing pundits trying to cram their new favorite word into every topic.  We have a "meme," and it feels like people want to earn their merit badges for using it while it still has currency.

Probably related, many people...don't get it.  They try to *make* it an insult, which---as I'll explain---completely defeats the purpose and plays into the idea that people shouldn't have any weird aspects to them.  When you see impassioned defenses of weirdness, they mean exactly this, that if we make weirdness *insulting*, then it provides an opening to shun artists, gender non-conforming people, protesters, and many more "weird" people.

As such, my defense of the idea only goes so far.  When you hear someone throw in a well-practiced "so weird" at the end of describing fairly bland behavior, please understand that I don't mean or support *that* nonsense.

## Authoritarians in a Nutshell

Regardless, I don't know if you've noticed it, but one of the societal problems that I believe that we've all needed to deal with in recent history stems from the fact that the worst people want to feel popular.  The George W. Bush campaign largely fabricated the idea that Americans should {% emoji clinking beer mugs %} "[want to get a beer with](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/10/gore200710)" (see "Running the Gauntlet") their President[^4], and the media fell for it instantly.  Elon Musk constantly [tries to find funny things to say](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/elon-musks-tweets-the-model-s-will-be-price-at-69420-because-hes-a-child/), often not realizing that [the joke targets people like him](https://futurism.com/elon-musk-accidentally-reveals-that-he-completely-missed-the-point-of-these-famous-movies) as he tries to use it against disadvantaged groups.  Donald Trump loves to camouflage his ideas as things that "[people are saying](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/how-to-talk-trump/550934/)" (see "Vague Source Attribution").

[^4]:  The whole likability thing probably deserves its own post with a ton of research, at some point, but I want to note that it probably originates in the socialization of business---after the U.S. Civil War, men joining service organizations like the [Knights of Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Columbus) to network---and echoed in [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger)'s stories, laying out a contrived connection between a person's demeanor and their utility in a crisis.

When that doesn't work, they try to [criminalize protest](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/05/mississippi-rising-supreme-court-mckesson/).  And that doesn't even touch on their many policies that revolve around creating conformity, their objection to [immigration from "the wrong countries,"](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/02/01/2017-02281/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states) the obsession with [instituting a national religion](https://wagingnonviolence.org/forusa/2023/01/christianity-will-fail-if-we-dont-stop-christian-nationalism/) or at least [push one religion over all others](https://theconversation.com/oklahomas-superintendent-orders-public-schools-to-teach-the-bible-relying-on-controversial-views-about-religious-freedom-233643), the [criminalization of gender and sexual minorities](https://otherwords.org/bathroom-bills-dont-help-women-at-all/), [patronage/spoils politics](https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/07/heres-now-trumps-new-vice-presidential-pick-stacks-federal-workforce-issues/398079/), and so forth.

{% pull authoritarianism in general builds on the premise that you can't trust people|left %}

Meanwhile, at the other end of the power distribution, the people who vote for these sorts of policies often seem to love nothing more than to gossip about who they think "secretly" agree with them.  On top of that, conservatism, and authoritarianism in general, builds on the premise that you can't trust people[^2].  They hate socialism---by which they mean anything that the government does to help people---because [they see people as lazy vermin](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sc-lt-gov-andre-bauer-compares-helping-poor-to-feeding-stray-animals/).  They want police funding, because they believe that society always stands [on the brink of collapse](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/) (see "American carnage"), and because they [see most people as dishonest](https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/07/13/republicans-best-grift-convincing-us-were-all-lazy/).  And they smear every out-group as trying to create dissent.  Oh, and because you can't trust anybody, they insist, you need to [arm yourself and become a vigilante](https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/15/after-kc-shooting-kris-kobach-says-good-guy-with-a-gun-needed-to-stop-mass-killings/).

[^2]:  If you (still) believe in "liberal media bias," consider how much news outlets *love* this premise.  They love a good story about [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) or the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect), even though the media exaggerated many cases to *create* those ideas in the popular consciousness.

On top of all that, they desperately want to see their system as *fair*, so none of them want to hear about the problems that people face because of these choices.  [Critical Race Theory offends them](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/stop-crt-bill-votes-in-congress-add-to-political-drama-over-critical-race-theory/2021/07), because it exposes that society doesn't treat its minority groups poorly.  You "[don't say gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Parental_Rights_in_Education_Act)," because we might realize that [misgendering people](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/KIN23435.pdf), [banning prospective parents from adoptions](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/foster_and_adoption_laws) because of sexual or gender identity, or whatever [causes material harm](https://theconversation.com/racism-and-discrimination-lead-to-faster-aging-through-brain-network-changes-new-study-finds-233959).  We can't have [labor unions](https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-cassidy-highlight-republicans-efforts-to-protect-american-workers-amid-help-hearing-pushing-big-labor-and-the-radical-pro-act/), because workers must love everything about their jobs.  Even when news breaks about a toxic workplace filming a classic film or television series, they *definitely* don't want to hear about that.  The guns come into this, too, as they insist that "[an armed society is a polite society](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/9/2/1881430/--An-armed-society-is-a-polite-society-is-a-call-for-more-gun-violence-not-less)," meaning that less-privileged groups would shut up and stop complaining, if they think that some ~~jerk~~ "good guy with a gun" might shoot them for complaining.

Authoritarians crave the illusion of support.  Supporters of authoritarians crave the illusion of comfort.

## Back to Weirdness

I think that you can probably see the point of my digression, up there.  The political right has extremely unpopular positions on *everything*, so they spend most of their time trying to manufacture a consensus that people---despite all evidence to the contrary---actually like them and their policies.  If you don't see that consensus in your neighborhood or other corner of the world, then they'll gleefully tell you that you "[live in a bubble](https://www.bostonherald.com/2018/10/16/democrats-need-to-burst-their-bubble/)."  You must, because how else could reality ever conflict with what they say?  Do you want to believe them or (bottom of the third column) [your own eyes](https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=ES19040505.1.2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------)?

Calling an authoritarian "weird" targets that cult of personality.  It punctures the bubble around their followers that convinces them that everybody secretly thinks like they do.

This hits the point where we start to see people flail to explain this, because the term doesn't connote any value judgment and people want it to.  Let's hit the dictionary for some background.  [Weird](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weird) has the following definitions, dismissing the archaic or niche versions of the adjective.

* Having an unusually strange character or behavior.
* Deviating from the normal; bizarre.

We could trim down most of that, too, if we also dismissed anything that used direct synonyms, but this will work.  Removing the old associations with magic, in other words, weird doesn't mean anything more than atypical.

To you or me, that doesn't pat us on the back or cause us any harm.  But to a person, a community, or political philosophy that can only stay relevant by making themselves seem more popular than actual numbers would suggest, "deviating from the normal" undermines their power.  To a person or a community that craves comfort, pointing out their conspicuous presence undermines their direction.

Despite what you see on social media, this has nothing to do with "good weird and bad weird."  *Those* people, feel free to call bullies, as they try to gate-keep who deserves respect.  The "weird" pseudo-attack says nothing more than that the person has wildly unpopular projects and doesn't speak for any large group of people.

## Quick Comparison

I'd like to make a point parallel to the issues involved in using *weird* to describe authoritarians by looking at words with similar moral value to them.  And let's use myself as an example.  In 2016 or so, I half-jokingly wrote somewhere---probably Quora---that Donald Trump's higher profile made me uncomfortable, because our descriptions overlap more than I'd like them to.

Donny-boy and I both identify as men, for example.  We both grew up and lived on---the physical thing, not the collection of political entities, in his case---Long Island.  Each of us has rather unfortunate hair.  We (probably) both weigh significantly more than we probably should for our sizes.  Both of us wear ties in professional situations.

I could go on, but you probably get the idea.  We *all* share little descriptions, but with some significant exceptions when a descriptor becomes so closely and widely associated with a person or group that it poisons it for everybody else, the fact that the addled old guy falls into the same categories as I do doesn't cause those categories to reflect on me as *associating* with the creep.

The same goes for weirdness.

This also explains why the "good weird and bad weird" idea makes no sense.  If somebody said "well, you have good height and bad height," you'd immediately dismiss that person as a crank.

## Act Natural...

This gets to one of the important aspects of...well, honestly, a lot of things, if I had to guess.  People---usually along conservative-or-progressive lines, but not always---differ in how they see others and their ability to change.

{% pull conservative policies flow from believing that individuals have some inherent nature %}

Generally speaking, conservative policies flow from believing that individuals have some inherent nature.  In such philosophies, for example, you use the criminal justice system to expose bad people so that you can segregate them from society, either temporarily (imprisonment) or permanently (execution), because you believe that criminality doesn't appear situationally, and so that person can't improve.  By contrast, believing---I'd say *seeing*, since I see evidence of it all the time---that people change means that you would want to use the system to rehabilitate all but the worst offenders and help the victims of crime, because jail and execution don't seem to improve anything.

This, I think, explains a lot of the fear of labels, too.  Racists *hate it* when you call out what they say and do as racist, as mentioned, at least partly because they don't grasp the idea that people change, so they feel that assessment as an inherent quality of their existence.  The rest of us realize that people stop calling you racist when you stop *acting* racist, because the accusation no longer holds up.

The "weird" label works in much the same way.  The word---to repeat---carries no value judgment.  If you don't want people calling you weird, though, then you can pretty much stop that by *not acting weird*.  You know, don't [make such a big deal about sizes](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5127703/donald-trump-compares-jan-6-crowd-size-crowd-mlks-speech)[^5] as if you desperately need to overcompensate for something[^6].  Don't keep insisting that you [speak for the people on issues like abortion](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2024/trump-abortion-roe-wade-overturned/), when a super-majority of adults disagree with you.  Don't [ignore the answers when you ask people about their lives](https://www.theroot.com/so-cringey-in-viral-video-jd-vance-embarrasses-himsel-1851630068)...or at least don't release the video when you flub things so badly.

[^5]:  I promise you that I wrote that before Obama made the {% emoji pinching hand %} same little joke at the DNC.  The length that I've revised this probably also goes to explaining why the majority of the references come from more than a couple of weeks ago.

[^6]:  This particular [citation](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23301515/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-penis-mushroom/) gets shoved into a footnote, because (a) I have no interest in its truth, (b) you probably don't want to click on it, and (c) it seemed funnier to make it a cliffhanger as to what I'd present down here...

People don't call you weird because of your essence[^7].  People call you weird as an assessment of how you act.  And like I said before---and promised that it would pay off---our interests and actions don't form our actual personalities.  You can change how you act and become less weird.  Tone things down, even, and people will never even notice.

[^7]:  OK, yes, *maybe* RFK, Jr., though I suspect that we'll eventually find out that illness has more to do with a career filled with [brain worms](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-people-get-parasitic-brain-worms-like-the-one-rfk-jr-had/), [attack emus](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-f-kennedy-jr-once-lived-with-an-emu-who-regularly-attacked-his-wife-now-he-just-has-pet-ravens-he-feeds-meat-scraps-and-yells-caw-caw-to), [whale decapitations](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/26/rfk-jr-whale-chainsaw-investigation), [Adderall labor camps](https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-adderall-labor-camps), and [dead bear pranks](https://time.com/7007802/rfk-bear-carcass-central-park/) than weirdness does.

I mentioned the problematic "good weird versus bad weird" explanations floating around, but I want to make the point, here, that two different kinds of people do actually exist in the loosest interpretation of this sense.  When you do something that makes you proud, and people call you weird, then you probably don't have much trouble with that assessment.  After all, remember the definition, "deviating from the normal," which sure, a lot of people who do good things certainly qualify.

However, when a person tries to shield bad behavior with some appeal to popularity---when they claim that "everybody does it," or that opposition can only come from some hypocrisy---then *weird* deprives them of that shield and makes them face the bad behavior on top of realizing that they can't bluster their way through arguments.

This makes it even funnier, in my eyes:  Nobody has any problem with weirdness, except for the people trying to get away with something.  Only confidence tricksters ("conmen") can't afford to embrace weirdness, because they can't afford to draw attention to themselves.  If Trump or Vance could have mustered a "ha, oh, you have no idea," we would probably have never heard about Tim Walz again.  But they can't, so he got enough attention that he became a candidate for the vice presidency.

### Another Quick Digression

Contrast this, by the way, with the (I hope still fringe) right-wing insistence on calling so many issues that they oppose "evil" or "Satanic."  Unlike "weird," they specifically mean that nobody can redeem their political opponents, to the point where they can justify violence.

The quantity of evil doesn't matter, after all; any evil makes the world worse.  They can't stop at a disagreement, because they don't have the resources---including correctness---to win on that basis.  They can't stop at calling people wrong, because people could educate themselves if that held up.

No, they need to call people wrong as a result of (fictional) [sex-trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory), for shady pseudo-medical reasons, to support Satanic rituals.  Every story needs to include all this, or else someone might think that you can reason with the alleged offenders.

Please make sure that, if nothing else, you grasp this difference.  Accusations of pedophilia, evil, and whatever else attempt to characterize people to support and justify (almost literal) witch hunts and political violence.  Accusations of weirdness attempt to highlight behavior to support and justify not having to take these clowns seriously as they prance around in their over-sized suit jackets hoping that the bulk makes them look thinner.  The former bullies.  The latter briefly shines a light.

## This Sounds Familiar

We have actually talked about this idea before in other contexts, I think some long-time readers might remember.  And if you haven't, you've surely seen it in news coverage.

Not too long ago Mitch McConnell described {% emoji ballot box with ballot %} [voting rights as a "power grab"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-voting-rights-bill_n_5c51ee80e4b04f8645c716ce).  Donald Trump has admitted that [Republicans rely on voter suppression to win](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus) as has [occasional advisor Justin Clark](https://www.ibtimes.com/election-2020-trump-adviser-admits-voter-suppression-traditionally-part-gop-strategy-2890528), and Trump has suggested that [he plans to increase suppression if he wins](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-christians-they-wont-have-vote-after-this-election-2024-07-27/).  And the list goes on, even to the [blatant plans to overturn elections](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/8/20/2264331/-Trump-supporters-focus-on-regaining-power-no-matter-how-Americans-vote) whose results disagree with their preferences.  They [gerrymander districts](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/redistricting-report-card/), too, to remove threats to their majorities in power, despite the aforementioned unpopular policies, too.

That all goes together with the need to look popular.  If they can keep dissenters from voting them out of office, make everybody think that they have broad support, and keep people from trusting one another, then it doesn't matter what people *actually* think, because they have insulated themselves from public opinion.

If you've ever wondered why Republican politicians fought to *prevent* their constituents from protecting themselves from COVID-19, this might help explain part of it.  Fewer citizens in a "red state" means fewer people to complain about policies, but gives them exactly as many votes in the Senate and---in many cases---almost the same number of votes in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College.

## The Flip-Side

Ironically, right-wing politicians already know all about this.

They have spent decades convincing everybody that "special interests" doesn't mean an association of monopolistic corporations spending billions of dollars on lobbying and outright bribes to get laws that only benefit them.  No, their frame uses "special interests" as groups like folks with disabilities wanting ramps installed in buildings allegedly open to the public.  They mean gay people wanting to get married or have children.  Or they mean women demanding equal pay.

Similarly, they have *always* insisted that every fight for social justice arose from some version of the {% emoji spy %} [outside agitator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_agitator).  Slaves loved their lives, they explained, so slave revolts and escape attempts could only happen because of radical Northerners putting ideas in their heads.  Everyone from the Civil Rights movement to the recent "maybe don't help a country commit genocide in the Palestinian Territories" protests had to have originated with those agitators, bringing in their specialized bike locks that the school...actually told everybody to buy to protect their bicycles.  The alt-right loves to smear people opposing their crackpot policies as [paid protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_protester) and/or [crisis actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_actor).

And don't forget the endless insistence that everything they don't like stands for an impending socialist and/or communist takeover, everything from taxing billionaires to maybe not letting police extra-judicially execute dark-skinned people.  Or consider the "coastal elites" that they see lurking and enacting nefarious plots behind every streetlamp, even as they support a billionaire New Yorker and a Silicon Valley wunderkind in their White House bid.

I could probably come up with more examples, but you can probably already see the theme, here.  While they can't dismiss progressive ideas as "weird," because they usually have wide appeal and solid empirical backing, they do want to try to convince you that everything that they don't approve of comes from some outlying fringe element, so you shouldn't support it.  If you *did* support those policies, it would make you an outlier, and we can't have that...

This might give us another reason why the term annoys them so much.  Usually, they stand up and whine about liberals and progressives using big words with foreign roots---another attempt to mark their opponents as outsiders, notice---and prefer short words with Germanic roots.  Here, they've spent dozens of syllables struggling to "other" the majority of their fellow citizens, and some governor of a "fly-over state" beats them at their own game by picking a one-syllable word with Germanic roots that marks them as outliers.

## Why Nothing Else Worked

You'll notice that "weird" has triggered panicked reactions in Republicans, lately, and I've gone through why *I* think it works.  But I also want to dig into why nothing else has.  In particular, if I can oversimplify a bit, every other attempt to point out the aberrance of right-wing policies seem like they fail for one central reason that only feels like a lot of different reasons.

At heart, at least to their existing supporters, the terms generally used feel either neutral or positive.  Call them authoritarian, fascist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, racist, misogynist, or bad at their jobs, and...*yeah*.  Everybody already knew that, because the politician in question has spent decades building exactly that brand.  When your party all but worships the [guy who called government "the problem"](https://pimaopen.pressbooks.pub/ushistory2/chapter/primary-source-first-inaugural-address-of-ronald-reagan-1981/) while taking charge of that exact government, it doesn't make much of an insult to tell them that they don't create helpful legislation.  When politicians of a certain stripe shift from [outright slurs to "states rights" to cutting taxes](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/), none of their supporters think that the racism went away or finds their exposure shocking.

{% pull those bills explicitly deprive minors of needed support|left %}

Sometimes, this comes down to messaging, rather than the message itself.  Recently, I've seen an increase in completely insipid articles along the lines of "Republican-Led Legislation Could Harm [insert group that the bill openly targets] Youth."  And again, *yeah*.  While they might deny the actual intent in a press conference, the plain language of those bills all either explicitly deprive minors of needed support or make so many actions illegal that it makes everybody afraid to support people who need it.  It doesn't harm the politicians to say that the prospective law might harm the people who they keep talking about hating.  Abortion restrictions, bathroom bills, immigration restrictions, book bans, and so forth all reject all legitimate studies and the desires of constituents specifically in order to inflict harm.

Worse, this all has the effect of making the politicians look powerful and dangerous, exactly the image that they want.  They would *much* rather that you start arguments about the racist reasons for and effects of their policies than have you point out that they all dress like clowns and have the emotional maturity of the most petulant teenagers, and they'd rather that you talk about that than notice how little support they actually have.  As much as Trump likes to talk about (and exaggerate) his 2016 margin of victory, he can't even fathom that he only had [a majority of a slim majority](https://the100million.org/), because about half of eligible voters don't vote, meaning that his support doesn't really exceed a quarter of the adult citizenry.

It doesn't make those more precise descriptions any less *true*, mind you.  They do genuinely have destructive ideas that exist primarily if not solely to support their bigotries.  But it does mean that telling them so doesn't *bother* them.  You save that for communicating with unsure voters, not political messaging.

## Some Other Takeaways

This extends beyond the abstract parts of politics.

For example, if you live in a conservative-to-authoritarian area, this idea should give you some hope, regardless of how you vote.  I occasionally hear from conservative readers---invariably under a pseudonym, and I can't blame them---who needs to admit that they actually do support perfectly reasonable progressive policies, such as abortion rights, of the "up until the fetus could plausibly live on its own, and even later if it endangers the life of the mother" variety.  The actual topic changes frequently, but abortion comes up a lot, and the structure of the message doesn't change much[^8].

[^8]:  The diction, however, changes so wildly that I don't believe that I have a single conservative fan with a hilariously bad memory and assortment of aliases, in case that thought crossed anybody else's mind.

They invariably mention in passing that they'd hate for their opinion to get out to community leaders.  And it always strikes me as funny (in a sad way), because the distrust that authoritarians foster in their followers and this exaggerated popularity makes them all afraid of consequences if they speak out, even though they almost certainly represent the majority view *even in their communities*.  Their leadership probably feels even more fear of speaking up for their actual beliefs, because their high profile makes them targets from both the community and *their* bosses.

Priests make a great example, here, because most of them lean extremely liberal, in my experience.  After all, you don't talk about Jesus every day and not notice that he spends pretty much all his time with societal outcasts, especially sex workers, while making snarky comments about the wealthy's lack of humanity[^3].  And it takes intellectual gymnastics to live with that idea, day after day, and also believe that goodness involves depriving people of their bodily autonomy or giving tax cuts to the wealthy.  And yet, if they announce what they actually believe, they feel like they risk vigilante violence from weirdos who believe in a petty, spiteful Jesus, *and* they risk their superiors disagreeing enough to reassign them.

[^3]:  No, seriously.  Go re-read Matthew 22:15–22, Mark 12:13–17, and Luke 20:20–26.  Sit with the context of the different views on the same story, and tell me that Jesus doesn't mean "things" as a pejorative for the creeps trying to use his religion to avoid paying taxes.  Or, to distill the story into modern terms, "if you love money so much, why don't you marry it?"

As such, I don't recommend (ever) pressuring anybody to take a stand that they don't want to take.  But dropping hints about your actual values gives people space to trust that they don't need to keep clinging to positions that healthy people don't actually have.  And if it doesn't work, remember that nobody gets to see who you vote for...

Also, even if you *don't* feel surrounded by people who worry you, you can still learn from this.  For times at work, at school, at family gatherings, online, and so forth, when you have someone acting in a way that hurts people, somebody who I've unfortunately forgotten taught me the weird-less magic words to quiet that person down...most of the time.

> We don't do that, here.

Sometimes you need to take a more verbose route and explain the behavior, but it quickly makes the point that no, this group doesn't stand for bigotry or otherwise making people feel unsafe.  And by engaging in that behavior, it excludes you from the group.  If you must act that way, you do it somewhere else.

I'll probably come back to this last idea in another post, but I didn't want to leave that out.

## Finally

If you like the title of weird, embrace it.  If you know weird people, embrace *them*.  I love things and people of almost every stripe of weird out there.

When people try to pass off their weirdness as reflecting mainstream thinking that you should follow, though?  Have a laugh at their expense, so that they understand that they've lost that particular game.  We don't do authoritarianism in this country.
