In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Genesis

Since the last post, over on **Deep Space Nine**, the crew learned a bit more about plain, simple Garak, while Quark riffs on **Casablanca**, in *Profit and Loss*.  This episode *might* not have as much depth.

 > **RIKER**: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we got comfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over.

Yuck...

No, really, thinking about how Riker smugly describes the incident, the carelessness of planning any activities requiring motion near that dangerous a cactus, and the fact that his date didn't *also* need medical treatment, and it paints a picture that his "rolling over" involved Smith defending herself.

 > **CRUSHER**: I thought we agreed you'd come to me before checking Starfleet Medical Database.

I only want to call this out because a few years after this episode, [WebMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMD) would make "I looked up my symptoms" hypochondria a mainstream problem that happens to benefit pharmaceutical and supplement companies.

 > **CRUSHER**: Oh, she's getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of hungry kittens before the week is over. Let me just run an amniotic scan to make sure everything's fine and then I'll---

...Wait.  How?

Prior episodes such as [*Phantasms*]({% post_url 2025-07-03-phantasms %}) and [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}) made it fairly clear that Data hasn't socialized his cat or exposed her to any nature-based stimuli, and we haven't seen other pets on the ship.  What got her pregnant, then?  Unfortunately, the way this show has gone, we can't really rule out that some energy creature wanted to experience organic life like in [*The Child*]({% post_url 2022-11-24-child %}) or that Data ordered cat semen online because he wanted the experience of watching his cat have a litter of kittens.  I don't claim that either of those *definitely* happened, but I do claim that we have more evidence of similar things happening than the idea of Spot meeting a Tom while snorting synthetic catnip at the bar or whatever.

Also, they don't spay their pets?  I can't even find any whacked-out conspiracy theories suggesting suppressed down-sides to spaying cats[^rqntEm], something that happens for pretty much any other medical treatment that you care to look for, so this entire pregnancy seems absurdly irresponsible and brings us back to the artificial causes.

[^rqntEm]:  Other than the obligatory "any medical intervention could go horribly wrong" disclaimer, I mean.  And I specify spaying, because I *do* see some maybe-but-not-significantly variety of talk about neutering male pets too early possibly correlating with minor side effects such as hip problems later in life.  Spaying a female cat, though, seems to only have benefits to the cat's life, as far as we can tell.

 > **BARCLAY**: So you mean I have bad genes?

The fact that this line gets voiced at all, without much push-back except for the most immediate that *he* doesn't have bad genes, should raise a red flag for everybody, because only supporters of eugenics ever seriously talk about (or condone talk about) "good" and "bad genes."  This probably doesn't surprise anybody, since the word "eugenics" literally references the former.

 > **DATA**: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the mystery until then.

Two things, here, I think.

First, yes, but "many humans" have *preferences* in terms of gender and surprise.  They don't make those decisions based on a straw poll of how other families in their community handled it.  Data treats it either like some creepy item on his to-do list---where Spot will "mysteriously" get pregnant again in a few weeks so that he can make the other choice---or as another attempt to fit in because he feels left out of the community again.

Second, "many humans" care deeply about this decision because they either want an early introduction to their new family member or because they don't want their biases to impact their reactions and preparation.  In other words, they have a deep investment in the birth, lending credence to the idea that Data experimented on his cat for this, because he seems to see himself as a main participant.

 > **OGAWA**: Spot's not the only one who's going to be a mother.

I can't help noticing that Ogawa, who we last saw in [*Lower Decks*]({% post_url 2025-09-04-lower-decks %}) on the verge of a promotion, seems to move through life a lot faster than the rest of these people.  I don't think that we've even seen her a dozen times, but her job changes, she has a stable relationship, and a kid on the way.  Meanwhile, the rest of them haven't had any changes to their lives[^yhGx85] in six years.

[^yhGx85]:  Technically, Crusher got a massive promotion slightly over six years ago, then walked away from it to return to her previous position.  And Riker, I guess, discovered his secret twin brother who (as far as we know) he never speaks to again.

 > **DATA**: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I would be happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience is any indication, he will need all the help he can get.

Yep.  Data, the "expectant parent," *absolutely* impregnated his cat with drop-shipped sperm.

 > Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performing field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister Worf is supervising the exercises.

They do dig blowing things up.  And they wonder why people see them as an aggressive military.

 > **WORF**: The torpedo is out of range.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Even for your newly improved phasers?

Jerk...

 > **DATA**: I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew whom Spot seems to like.

The scene will then make the point that, of all the characters we've seen, only Barclay treats the cat like a cat and not some minion to boss around and abuse, perhaps explaining *why* Spot likes him.

 > **BARCLAY**: I'm curious, sir. Who's the father?
 >
 > **DATA**: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on several occasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run a full DNA analysis on the kittens once they---

I've already accidentally presented my case that this assertion doesn't fit the facts that we've seen; I see no chance that Spot mated with a male cat, the way these people treat their pets.  But it does make explicit that he didn't care enough to have her spayed, and also shows that other owners similarly show no interest in neutering their pets.

 > **WORF**: Must you to stand so close to me?

I take Worf's reaction to confirm my hypothesis that Riker forms the nucleus of a tangible cloud of communicable infections and Axe body spray.

 > **WORF**: Do not approach me unannounced, especially when I'm eating.

Same, but cheap cocoa powder and empty aphorisms...

 > **TROI**: You're excused.

Oh, no, Worf has normal bodily functions, whatever will she do if he doesn't apologize for them...?

 > **RIKER**: Wait a minute. Slow down. I lost you back there. Which sensor clusters?

I know, shock of shocks, Riker didn't pay attention.

 > **RIKER**: He's full of energy today.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I can't get him to slow down. He's been working like that since last night,

I kind of get a chuckle out of how much it irritates him that the character who they introduced by calling him a slacker has started running circles around them.

 > **WORF**: Computer, reset environmental controls to standard.
 >
 > **TROI**: Worf, it's freezing in here.

Long after this episode, studies would show what many observers noted anecdotally, that most offices set the climate control [too low for women](https://www.inc.com/anna-hensel/blame-gender-bias-for-cold-office-temperatures.html), and that it [affected their performance](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727108363/how-office-temperature-affects-cognitive-performance).

 > **RIKER**: The weapon systems?
 >
 > **DERN**: Yes, sir. The ones we've been testing for the past few days?

I know that the episode wants us to see this as another clue to the direction of the episode, but this really feels like normal Riker behavior, not paying attention to what he needs to know for a mission or listening to what anybody has to say...

 > **CRUSHER**: Call Doctor Selar and Doctor Hacopian. It looks like we've got some sort of viral infection going on around here. I want to check on Lieutenant Worf.

Selar still works here, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: Adjust the axial stabilizers to match the attitude and rotation rate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually.

You can tell that the franchise finally feels like it has competition, here---**Babylon 5** kicked off the weekly series (as opposed to the pilot film) a little over a month before this aired---by how, for the first time, it feels the need to make a point about arbitrary orientation in space.

 > **DATA**: It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermal layer that has been cast off during molting.

Granted, I don't have biology credentials that stretch past high school.  But even so, I don't think "composed of DNA" describes skin.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard the *Enterprise* that shed their skin in this fashion.

Well, that might have held true when they left, but the presence of the shed skin seems to imply that a species there definitely does *now*, right?

 > **DATA**: Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic flux. Her genetic codes are being re-sequenced and her cells are mutating as a result. At a fundamental level, sir, she is no longer human.

B-but...oh, never mind.  They think that they make skin out of DNA.  Quibbling about Troi's ethnicity probably won't go well.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died. Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms within the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we observed in Counselor Troi.

Wait, but they had more than a thousand members of the crew, plus all the assorted animals, between pets, weird zoo exhibits, and presumably experiments, and that doesn't even get to the bacteria and viruses.  Did they lose that many members of the crew in three days?

 > **DATA**: Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent. His brain is much smaller, sir. I do not believe he can comprehend our language.

No comment.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to confirm that observation. Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving.

Not a thing, because evolution doesn't have a direction or a plan, but the first reference to genetics in the episode specifically called out "bad genes," so I suppose that we can't assume that they care about how things *actually* work...

Also, pardon my commenting on the writing, but while I already need to talk about evolution, for the sake of having said it, evolution also doesn't work *this* way, either, because we don't have arachnid and amphibian ancestors.  Best that we can reconstruct the early development of vertebrate life, the early [tetrapods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapod) separated into amphibians and [amniotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniote), the earliest of which probably resembled reptiles more than anything else.  The amniotes divided into [sauropsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropsida) (becoming reptiles and birds) and [synapsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsida), which became mammals and what we used to call "mammal-like reptiles" rather than admit that some dinosaur-looking things didn't fit with the reptiles.

Going back the other way, tetrapods seemingly evolved from fish, with jawed fish (and other vertebrates) evolving from jawless fish (like lampreys and eels), which covers only the vertebrates.  Skipping back a few more steps, the [chordates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordate) split from the [arthropods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropoda) and [mollusks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca) long before that, probably during or before the [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion).  The most recent common ancestor that we have with spiders, for example, goes through the [bilateral clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria), all creatures that show bilateral symmetry.  The fossil record does *not* suggest that the early bilateral ancestors evolved into spiders, who progressively lost legs until they became fish, then evolved into amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.

All that to say that, while I can't speak to any of the non-humans, Barclay (for example) absolutely does not have spider DNA "left over."  I'll buy hominids, some primates and other animals, though probably not anything that we'd recognize today, the aforementioned "mammal-like reptiles" (actually reptile-like mammals), all sorts of fish, and a variety of worms, if we accept the premise.  Everything else feels like they should've altered the plot device to something that incorporated random bits of DNA.

 > **DATA**: I have analyzed Commander Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic T-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activate his latent introns.

Despite Picard's inability to pronounce the word, [introns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron) refer to the genes in DNA that cells don't transcribe into RNA.  We call the rest [exons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon).

The episode's premise falls out of the understanding at the time---minus the aforementioned terrible approach to evolution---where people connected "not transcribed into RNA" to the earlier idea of [junk DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_DNA).  And like the fictions about humans only using small parts of the brain, the myth that we didn't actively use most of our genetic material spurred a variety of wild theories about what that "extra" material might do if activated.  Those sorts of theories fell out of favor quickly as the [Human Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project) progressed and ended, and as we've studied the various transcription processes more deeply.

 > **DATA**: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should work on non-human crew-members in the same way. They are each de-evolving to earlier forms of life on their home-worlds. I feel I must inform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus.

It almost seems weird to call out and rely on the related genetics of the various peoples in the galaxy and not tie the plot at all to [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}).

 > **DATA**: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of early primate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset.

They one hundred percent could've milked this show for at least an eighth season if, right here, they shrugged their shoulders and went with an all-animal crew led by a bald marmoset.  Actually, you know what?  I can't resist this one.

![Patrick Stewart's face poorly blended onto a pygmy marmoset's](/blog/assets/pygmy-marmoset-Picard.png "Go ahead.  Tell me that you wouldn't watch this...")

I considered doing this for the post's header image, but then I would've felt compelled to do more work on the crown of the head so that it doesn't show as transparent, try to work in a little uniform or at least some variation of the badge, maybe add some of the rest of the crew as different animals, and then posting it on social media would've looked like a mess.  But the idea still seemed too good to pass up completely.

 > **PICARD**: Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid.
 >
 > **DATA**: Nurse Ogawa has recently become pregnant.

I present to all of you, systemic sexism in action.  It took, what, fifteen minutes for these two clowns to reduce a professional woman who has probably saved their lives multiple times to nothing more than an ambulatory womb, a convenient resource to harvest and exploit, rather than a person.

 > **CRUSHER**: No. In a way it's mine. I didn't realize it at the time, but there's an anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic T-cell to mutate. Instead of activating one dormant gene, it started activating all of them, including your introns.

Speaking of sexism, yes, blame the doctor for failing to prevent T lymphocytes from spreading through the air and becoming infectious, a thing that can't sensibly happen and makes *much* less sense than the evolution stuff.

## Conclusions

We don't really get much out of this, given the episode's focus on the plot.

### The Bad

On top of the other signs that we've seen of poor pet care, we now see that owners don't spay and neuter their pets.  And despite his claims otherwise, the facts of the case strongly suggest that Data experimented on his cat so that he could pretend to experience childbirth, including referring to himself as an expectant father.

We also see a vision of evolution that seems strongly rooted in eugenics, rather than any actual science.

Ogawa and Barclay, in different ways, make the privileged and powerful members of the crew look lazy and stagnant.  And the rest of the crew seems to resent that.  Possibly similarly, while the plot tries to excuse it, Riker continues to pay no attention to anything that anybody tells him.

We also see more evidence that Starfleet exists for war, as they expand their weapon systems again.

The dominance plays appear to have metastasized into boring sniping at each other.  And they apparently object to knowing that their colleagues have conventional biological functions.

We still see that the ship's systems have a specific kind of person in mind for its officers, this time focusing on temperature.  Combined with how quickly they rush to find a pregnant woman who they can use as a chemical resource, it strongly suggests ingrained sexism, beyond the terrible ergonomics and racism.  That especially holds for blaming the doctor for not considering that human immune cells might spread virally.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Wesley becomes so insufferable that you almost want to side with the ethnic cleansing of a disadvantaged people who they use a wholly inappropriate name for, in *Journey's End*.
