Today marks the ninety-seventh anniversary of the opening of the [Roxy Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Theatre_%28New_York_City%29) in New York City, which you've probably heard of despite owners demolishing it sixty-four years ago.  In 1927, with almost six thousand seats, it stood as the world's largest movie theater.

I know.  March has the worst holidays, and only barely usable anniversaries.  At this rate, by the end of the month, I'll need to talk about somebody's birthday...

![The cover of a weekly magazine dedicated to the Roxy, declaring it "the Cathedral of the Motion Picture"](/blog/assets/roxy-theater-magazine.png "...None of the scenes look like things that would work particularly well in silent film, do they?")

Anyway, let's get to the week's projects.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

I noticed that, somehow in my haste, I didn't add the Material Design regular expression icon to the repository.  Therefore, this week, I broke with my only-going-to-update-libraries plan to fix that oversight.

As an unfortunate side effect, I now have a pile of tiny images floating around the application directory with no organization.  I'll need to think about fixing that, at some point.

## Library Updates

As mentioned recently, I needed to bump library versions for [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Generic Board Game**](https://github.com/jcolag/generic-board-game), [**Ham Newsletter**](https://github.com/jcolag/ham-newsletter), [**Renewal Database**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB), [**Scan Data**](https://github.com/jcolag/ScanData), [**Slackup**](https://github.com/jcolag/slackup), and [**Zoea**](https://github.com/jcolag/zoea).

## Next

I'll almost certainly continue clearing out the backlog of library version updates.
