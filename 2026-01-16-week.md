As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Because people who work in tech still believe in the power of tech to do good things, many of us won’t just dismiss outright the possibility that any technology — even AI tools like LLMs — could yield some benefits. But the optimistic takes are tempered by the first-hand knowledge of how the tools are being used as an excuse to sideline or victimize good people.

For the financial effects on the companies if this bizarre move, you might also want to check out [Code is a liability (not an asset)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/06/1000x-liability/) from Pluralistic.  I also have a post coming---probably this Sunday---that starts calculating the financial effects of using language models to generate code, based on the studies that we have available.

To recap, the political party worried about pedophiles everywhere elected an authoritarian pedophile among others to high office and accept funding from someone who finds it hilarious to run a Child Pornography As a Service website.  Oh, and if you missed it back in September, [the funding source also planned to travel with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/09/26/elon-musk-planned-trip-to-epsteins-private-island-newly-released-documents-show/), who the president also palled around with for decades.

I don't want to get on the "ha, look at the hypocrisy" of people with no principles.  However, I do want to suggest that maybe we should try to convince, coerce, or trick them into hating wealth.  I figure that, the way they work, we'd all have enough money to retire by the end of the summer...

 > Third, and most importantly, foreign invasions fail to address the true underlying cause of the crisis: public suffering. While drug abuse is a complex problem, poverty, homelessness, over-criminalization, social stigmas, and a lack of adequate health care are among the leading factors.

I bring in these sorts of articles whenever I run across them, because I can't emphasize enough that, despite what society fights to teach us, pretty much every study says that we most efficiently solve almost all society's problems with a strong social safety net.  Every other proposed solution either fails completely or costs far more than treating people well.

If the politics of the situation get much worse, Trump will almost certainly need a scapegoat.  I wonder if getting rid of Miller would do any good, apart from having one less creep in the administration.

Honestly, I missed the announcement until this story, but I also certainly wouldn't believe any of it.  Trump's entire personality has always revolved around bigotry and shaking down tenants, nothing more.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw RFK Jr., Dead Animals %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [New Records Reveal the Mess RFK Jr. Left When He Dumped a Dead Bear in Central Park](https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-dead-bear-cub-central-park-photo/) from WIRED

 > According to emails obtained by WIRED, Handy updated several colleagues throughout the day, noting that the Department of Environmental Conservation had arrived on scene and that the agency was planning to coordinate with the NYPD to transfer the body to the Bronx Zoo, where it would be inspected by the NYPD’s animal cruelty unit and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. (This didn’t end up happening, as NYDEC took the bear to a state lab near Albany.)

One thing in the article stands out to me, and the author didn't note it:  The man that the government wants us to look to for health advice claims that his drunk friends peer pressured him into [driving twenty minutes](https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=40.7098661%2C-73.9625564%3B40.7827725%2C-73.9653627#map=13/40.73380/-73.92623) (assuming no traffic) to dump the bear in a park.  You can't tell me that this trek didn't show up on at least a hundred surveillance cameras from every angle.

 > In the years that followed, Spanish soldiers captured Indigenous people across the Southwest and sold them into slavery, too. For Pueblos and other Indigenous peoples, the intertwined military, political and spiritual invasions threatened seemingly every aspect of their lives.

If you read the blog across multiple topics, you might already know this history, because Po'pay's rebellion came up when I went through [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}) for the *Star Trek* posts, and I dug into their reference a bit.  Either way, I would consider it important and fascinating history.
