As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

We all do need to remember that we only fight *some* fights because we know that we can win.  Other fights, we take up because we have a moral obligation.  And still others, we take up because we have no other choice.

I've heard this rumor whispered for decades, so I really appreciate seeing somebody dig into the likelihood.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Sometimes it's necessary to evacuate large groups quickly, without people getting hurt in the process.  Good design of exit routes and doorways is literally lifesaving.  A lack of emergency exits at the 2021 Astroworld Festival in Houston may have led to 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries.
