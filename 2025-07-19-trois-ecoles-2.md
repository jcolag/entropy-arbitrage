This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **Trois écoles** (**Three Schools**), the second chapter *Ocre rouge* or *Red Ochre*, through the first three sections (marked with three asterisks) of the third chapter *Fluorine ombre* or *Fluorine Shadow*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Trois écoles — Première partie**

 * Released:  2024

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Trois écoles

The book's website describes it as follows.

> Au milieu des années 2030 en France, la surveillance commence à se retourner contre les très riches et les gouvernants. Des chaînes de volontaires de plus en plus efficaces se fédèrent chaque jour de façon anonyme pour espionner grands patrons et cabinets de consultants. Parmi tous ces noyaux de contre-surveillance quotidienne, un petit groupe mieux organisé garde encore le secret. Depuis plus de dix ans, sa logistique clandestine se perpétue en vue d’attaquer un jour, pour de bon, les nœuds du pouvoir.
>
> À une époque de changements technologiques profonds où les neurosciences commerciales ont fait un bond, c’est une hypothèse à la pointe de la recherche scientifique qui pourrait fournir le moyen d’action le plus efficace, et le plus rapide. L’une des membres du groupe, autodidacte en psychologie et sciences cognitives, y croit dur comme fer.
>
> Mais le temps presse, et les pièces les plus importantes ne sont pas encore en place à l’approche du déclenchement révolutionnaire prévu par le groupe sans nom. Il faut réussir à négocier la sortie de laboratoire d’un outil à technologie neurale, par le réseau d’un trafiquant, et opérer un regroupement géographique avec une ancienne formation de combattantes dispersées à travers l’Europe.
>
> Autour de cette nébuleuse clandestine, des obstacles qu’elle rencontre et de ses contradictions, plusieurs voix, plusieurs parcours naissent ou s’abîment dans l’espoir d’une révolution prochaine.

Or in English, that looks more like this.

> In the mid-2030s in France, surveillance begins to backfire on the very rich and powerful. Increasingly efficient volunteer channels contrive anonymously to spy on the big bosses and consulting firms. Of all these daily counter-surveillance nuclei, a small, better organized group still keeps secret. For more than a decade, its clandestine logistics have been perpetuated in order to attack the centers of power for good.
>
> In a time of profound technological change where commercial neurosciences have leaped forward, there is a hypothesis at the cutting edge of scientific research that could provide the most effective and fastest means of action. One of the group's self-taught members in psychology and cognitive science believes it firmly.
>
> But time is running out, and the most important pieces are not yet in place as the unnamed group approaches their revolutionary trigger. They must successfully negotiate the laboratory theft of a neural technology tool, through a trafficker’s network, and to coordinate a geographical group with a former combatant organization scattered across Europe.
>
> Around this clandestine nebula, the obstacles it encounters and its contradictions, several voices, several paths are born or are damaged in the hope of an imminent revolution.

Oh, speaking of translations, I'll read most if not all the text through machine-translation.  I do this mostly because I've let my French get so rusty that it'd take forever to do this properly, but it comes at the cost that I might miss clever aspects or have trouble following the plot more than I would otherwise.

I should note that, while the author made the book available under the cited license, they have made the "script materials" such as the synopsis and characters available under a CC0 public domain dedication.

## What Works Well?

While the start of this section feels so unfocused that I thought that I accidentally dropped into wrong book or missed a chapter, it does have a couple of decent comments.

> Le capitalisme mange le temps. Et quand il le digère ensuite il ne reste que du charbon.

Or, in English, we have this.

> Capitalism eats time. And when he then digests it there is only coal left.

I suppose that may hint at why the [first chapter]({% post_url 2025-07-12-trois-ecoles-1 %}) had coal (well, anthracite) in the title.

Also, while I admit that I don't really understand the relevance to the story, I like the insertions of (presumably) business cards and advertisements to play with the prose format.

Finally, while I don't like how we got there, the final scenes in this section do have a tension to them that I can appreciate.  It even seems to include a quick acknowledgement that Sabine (along with the narrative) has gotten caught up in her head instead of her goals.  The latter might not make it more enjoyable to read, but it makes the writing choice more comprehensible.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I hinted at this above, but a lot of this section could do with a serious edit.  Maybe something didn't come across in the translation, but it seemed like it wanted to jump around to different anecdotes, flashbacks, and idle thoughts.  And while I don't mind introspection, it takes forever to tell us who introspected for so long.

Similarly, the third chapter feels disjointed for a lot of what we read, here.  We have a debriefing that doesn't seem to reveal anything, then Sabine overhears a conversation in a high-class hotel that doesn't seem to have any relevance to the story, because he gets in a cab to pick up a package.  Then we reflect on a text message exchange, drop that, and move on to a conversation about Sims and some implant.  And should we care about the consultant, Romain, Gabin, and Jordan other than filler until something interesting happens?  In fact, including the previous paragraph, it feels like we spent a full fifty pages with Sabine's---and as mentioned in the previous section, the final sequence in this section does appear to briefly acknowledge this as intentional to illustrate Sabine's problems---stream of consciousness as she drives to the location we end at.  It gives us *some* sense of the world of the story, but even that feels sparse.

## Opportunities

The book does have the repository on Codeberg noted above, which has seen a fairly regular activity by the author every couple of months.  The author also has a couple of other projects that you might find interesting.

## What's Adaptable?

Off in the corner, we get a mention of Sabine passing a Bébé Discount, Sanitub, Doggy Crock, Ravi METAL, and Pharmacie Bréguin, presumably all storefronts.

Singing duo [Monchy & Alexandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monchy_%26_Alexandra) get a mention, too, but they actually exist.  As some middle ground, while people named Madeleine Diakité exist---a quick web search turned up social media profiles---superficial inspection doesn't turn up any prolific authors.

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll finish-for-now reading **Trois écoles**, wrapping up *Fluorine ombre* and going through the first segment (until the three asterisks) of *Manganèse*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
