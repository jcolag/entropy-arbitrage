Today, we try to bring [awareness to post-traumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_PTSD_Awareness_Day).  As a shared culture, we have spent centuries noting it---often in soldiers, to the exclusion of everyone else---and proceeding to marginalize the victims in various ways.  We seem to finally have our first broad understanding of the issues involved and treatments beyond hiding from the world.

I feel thankful to not share in this disorder, but we shouldn't really ignore any issue affecting nearly seven percent of the population, and so I wrote a bit about the issues involved when describing my approach to [content advisories]({% post_url 2021-07-04-advisory %}), around this time last year.

...And now I don't have a segue.  I also haven't gotten much done, this week.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Slack Backup**](https://github.com/jcolag/SlackBackup), [**Uxuyu**](https://github.com/jcolag/Uxuyu), and [**Replybrary**](https://github.com/jcolag/library-twitterbot).

## Next

I still have plans to return to **Salavi**, and will eventually work in a new idea that has come to me.
