Today marks the two hundred twelfth birthday of [Juan Pablo Duarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Duarte), folk hero and founding father of the Dominican Republic for spending most of his life fighting for independence from Spain.

And on to the week's projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the third.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the sixth of January.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For November, I wrote a piece on what I actually (mostly) mean when I talk about looking forward to watching less media, discussed my media consumption, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Mini-Server, Part 20

While, once again, I don't know if I'll *play* it often, reviewing my notes drew my attention back to [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/), a JavaScript programming game.  I tried deploying it to my server, and it worked like a dream.  It has no build step or server, so I could drop the entire repository on a computer's default web directory and it works immediately.

The mini-server family may also expand soon.  I haven't had time to inspect much of it, but I found another pile of older computers.  What do I mean by pile?

- Another mini-PC, which *might* have preceded the former media server that doesn't work, or I may have forgotten about it.
- A netbook, which boots to [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) though I don't recall what password I used, and has a handful of dead keys on the keyboard.
- A Pinebook, missing the power adapter.
- Raspberry Pi-like single-board computers from old Kickstarter campaigns, two from [Udoo](https://www.udoo.org/) and two from [Zero ASIC](https://www.zeroasic.com/)'s Parallella project.

I doubt that the netbook will have any real use, though since it can tolerate a USB keyboard (unlike some old laptops), it might make a fun way to try out [Collapse OS](https://collapseos.org/).  If the mini-PC works, and doesn't collapse under load like the other one, then it'll become the new media server.  If I can scrounge up a power adapter for it (5 V/3 A, I believe), then the Pinebook will probably become the "bedroom laptop" (and spare) running scripts and the noise generator, while the current old laptop returns to its place as the media server.  And I haven't the foggiest idea if I can get any use out of the single-board computers, but maybe I'll come up with something.

It always seems like a complete waste to throw out computers that might have even the *tiniest* bit of use squeezed out of them, so even where I've yanked out hard drives to save the data, I have computers going back decades.  And then I forget about them, because I don't bother to keep track of that sort of thing.

## Codidact

Especially in comparison to the posts here about Large Language Models, I wrote a quick answer for [Should the presence of AI-generated writing be considered a problem in writing?](https://writing.codidact.com/posts/295322/295327#answer-295327).

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-posts %}

All my (limited) time, this week, went to adding labels to more developer diary posts.  At this time, that work stretches back to August 2021.  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel, at least for these posts.

## Next

Yes, as you've already guessed, I plan to keep pushing through the labeling process.  I don't see the per-project labels as completely useful until we have a complete set of them, so I want to prioritize that, even though I have other projects that I want to get back to.
