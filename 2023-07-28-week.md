As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 2:03 PM -- Sun 23 July 2023

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Asked on Lemmy](https://lemmy.sdf.org/post/1195748)

 > I could use some input.  For context, I write a blog where, among other things, I run a ["book club" for Free Culture fiction](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/tag/bookclub), figuring that the least that I can do is spread the word about interesting projects that can use some help.  I'm always looking for new things to cover on Saturdays, but games (that make sense in context) especially seem elusive, so I'd like to see if anybody has any possibilities that I hadn't considered.
 >
 > So far, I've gotten to [**Forgotten**](https://aetherinteractive.itch.io/forgotten), [**Endgame: Singularity**](https://singularity.github.io/), [**Nothing to Hide**](https://github.com/ncase/nothing-to-hide), [**The House**](https://the-house.arturkot.pl/), [**A Dark Room**](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), [**Cataclysm:  Dark Days Ahead**](https://cataclysmdda.org/), [**Space Company**](https://sparticle999.github.io/SpaceCompany), [**Learn to Code RPG**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/LearnToCodeRPG), [**Dead Ascend**](https://blackgrain.dk/games/deadascend/), [**Level 13**](https://nroutasuo.github.io/level13/index.html), [**One Hour One Life**](http://onehouronelife.com/), [**Counterfeit Monkey**](https://github.com/i7/counterfeit-monkey), [**The Command Line Murders**](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery), [**SQL Murder Mystery**](https://mystery.knightlab.com/), [**Colossal Cave Adventure**](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=fft6pu91j85y4acv), [**Death off the Cuff**](http://www.sichris.com/Games/Cuff), and [**kiki the nano bot**](https://kiki.sourceforge.net/).  Hopefully, I didn't miss anybody.  A couple also sit in my queue waiting for a free day when I can make sure that I can run them and confirm licenses.
 >
 > What I'm specifically looking for are games that (a) exist somewhere that a person can find them, even if that means (occasionally) spending some money, (b) has a license compatible with CC-BY-SA, at least for the storytelling aspects and (ideally) art assets, which *generally* excludes the GPL, but I make an occasional exception for exceptional cases, (c) ideally not related to a prior game by forking or overlapping authors (though still mention them, because I'll come back to those when I run out of new things), and (d) has some kind of narrative that goes beyond the literal main character overcoming obstacles.  I'm somewhat lax on my definition of "narrative," where I'll accept world-building as long as it's evident in-game and not in an unlicensed design document.

 > Thanks in advance!

While not strictly necessary, I figured that I might as well reach out from my new Lemmy account in hopes of finding a few new games for the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub).

I couldn't *not* comment on the corporate name change, particularly since I've always had a soft spot for this sketch.  Any time people make a big deal about something changing names, this comes to mind.

 > Some state legislators argued that the amendment was too controversial given its potential to upend traditional gender roles and legalize what they called ‚Äúabortion on demand.‚Äù

Hashtags:  #USPol #ERA

It occurs to me that we have a lot of hand-wringing about the artificial and unconstitutional "expiration date" put on the ERA, and we don't talk enough about how the [Corwin Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment) still quietly waits for some right-wing state legislator to push the idea that the Federal government has no right to interfere with how the states prevent---or more to the point, *fail* to prevent---slavery within their borders.

Really.  We set a time limit on the discussion of whether we should treat women like people, but not on the discussion about treating people like livestock due to race.

Hashtags:  #Sexism #Sports

As a rule, I don't follow professional sports, because the nature of the situation means that you have owners and trade organizations becoming wealthy at the expense of the players, who then need to scramble and find a second career, because the human body can't take decades of abuse.  That said, *if* I watch professional sports, I try to make a choice that'll destigmatize a sport that gender- or race-coding keeps people from enjoying.

Hashtags:  #SNAP #EBT #Poverty

One of these days, I'll write an entire blog post on the broader subject around this, the idea that a lot of politics grows directly out of security threat models.  For example, you can almost completely define conservatives by the idea that it doesn't matter how many people suffer or die, as long as they don't accidentally help even *one* person who (in their eyes) doesn't deserve help.  They see this as so important, that they'll spend many times more money on making help harder to get than it would have cost to help everybody.  Meanwhile, the rest of us either mostly don't care if a middle-class person gets food assistance, or certainly don't want to spend more stopping that person than it would cost if they succeeded at defrauding the system.

You don't need me to say anything about this, right?  We all understand that moral panics exist entirely to draw attention away from immense harm somewhere else and putting that attention on the shoulders of vulnerable people?  Good.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Public outrage led to protests in at least 11 provinces. The hashtag #‡∏°‡πá‡∏≠‡∏ö16‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏é‡∏≤66 (#RespectMyVote) was used on social media to remind senators and other conservative legislators to uphold the decision of Thai voters. Some activists have called for a boycott of businesses owned by senators and their families.

Best of luck to the Thai people.  Everybody deserves a government led by its people, rather than a self-styled leadership class.

I've said for a while that people like Leo only care about one "right," the right for them to avoid criticism of everything that they say or do.  Everybody else should hate or fear each other, but they have too thin a skin to deal with even the most minimal criticism.
