As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.
