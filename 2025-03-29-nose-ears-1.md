This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Nose Ears**, from *Hate* (#1) through *Climate Catastrophe* (#50).

![Comic #20, Proprietary Social Media. The first panel has Mimi ask Eunice why they don't join proprietary social media, since it has much more polish, followed by a later panel where Mimi screams that evil corporations have taken over the Internet](/blog/assets/NE_en_20_hu15806520806758061560.png "A comic that knows how to play to its audience")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Nose Ears**
 * Location:  <https://wuzzy.neocities.org/>
 * Released:  2021 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Wuzzy](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/)
 * Medium:  Comic strip
 * Length:  Approximately one thousand strips (currently)
 * Content Advisories:  Characterization of bigotry, some over-simplified arguments

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Nose Ears

OK, so we need to start by pointing out that this comic derives its characters and art from Nina Paley's **Mimi and Eunice**, about who and which more later.  That out of the way, the website describes the comic as follows.

 > Nose Ears is an absurd comic about the absurd things in life. There’s not any particular topic because absurdity can be found everywhere: In the Internet, in computers, games, gender, bigotry, power structures, copyright, language, crappy ideologies, belief systems, emotions and much more.
 >
 > There’s also an official German version. A few comic strips are untranslatable, so they only exist in one language.

It also has a [long history](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/meta/long_history/) page that details the thinking that went into deciding to adapt/continue/rebut the original comic.

And that brings us to Paley.  We've "met" her before, when talking about [**Sita Sings the Blues**]({% post_url 2021-11-06-sita %}).  And in that post, I explained the unpleasantness surrounding any support for her.  I respect that she probably did more than anybody else---through publicizing her film---to bring people to Free Culture, *but* she got there herself to spite the estate of [Annette Hanshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Hanshaw) for daring to enforce copyright against an artist who didn't bother to do any research.  Because this incident led her to oppose copyright in general, she has expressed support for paying to support companies who manufacture physical media or stream media digitally, but not artists.  Her two major films both aggressively dismiss non-Western culture.  And in trying to defend her transphobia, has expressed anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, misogynist, and anti-science views, while blaming some variation of the woke mob for the backlash against her transphobic comics.

I go through all this, not because I want to "take her down" or give her any attention at all, but partly to warn you that supporting her work will inevitably tie you to all her issues, and maybe more importantly for this post, indicate what about **Nose Ears** caught my attention.  You see, I learned about the project when the creator posted on Mastodon---I can't find the toot---that they think of the comic as a Free Culture experiment, taking the good parts of work by a problematic individual like Paley, and building on it to create something that puts the concept to better use without whitewashing their problems.

## What Works Well?

First, to finish the thought from the introductory remarks, the comic exemplifies a lot of what I've always wanted to see in Free Culture.  When I [introduced this series of posts]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}), I talked about especially wanting to find properties that could grow beyond the creator's personal attention.  And every week, I talk about elements of each work that you or I could "borrow" for exactly those purposes.  This comic deals with both, and stands against a lousy political stance.  Even if we didn't find anything else worth talking about, the comic already feels valuable from that perspective.

And some comics already take on the strip's predecessor's lousy politics.  Let's take the first big example that I noticed.

![Comic #26, Sweeping Generalizations.  Eunice asserts that you can't make sweeping generalizations about trans people.  Mimi counters that all trans people are valid.  Eunice rethinks their position](/blog/assets/NE_en_26_hu4703116701650382992.png "A vastly superior handling of the existence of transgender folks")

Thank you, comic. {% emoji raised fist %} This section includes a significant run of related comics, too, some taking even more direct aim[^1].  And I should mention that many of those comics have some annotations citing the arguments that it rebuts, verifying that it hasn't created a [straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).

[^1]:  I wish that I could say that I carefully *planned* this, but the fact that this post goes out two days before this year's International Day of Transgender Visibility, too, pleases me to no end.

And while the various [background pages](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/meta/making_of/) "spoil the illusion" to some extent, by explaining how the comic comes together, I appreciate the consistency and the direct resemblance to its source.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Even considering the comic's origins, it feels awkward and excessive how often the joke comes from an analogy between lending or otherwise sharing physical media (legitimate) and distributing copies of files under copyright for public consumption (piracy, because we call that *publishing*).  Worse, it takes this simplistic argument, despite the history that it really only ever encourages copyright maximalists to realize that they could probably squeeze out even more profits if you *couldn't* share physical media, so it won't even have its intended effect.

The author also works on [Repixture](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/repixture) (main developer) and [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org) (co-developer), which might also warrant some support.

## What's Adaptable?

Most notably, [Comic #25, *Corporate Inclusivity*](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/comic/25/) introduces Corporation, Incorporated.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll continue **Nose Ears**, reading *Malicious Software* (#51) to *Peak Equality* (#99).  If you reach *Doing your Best* (#102), then you've gone too far.  I assume that no English versions of #100 and #101 exist, if you also wonder about the gaps.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
