Today, the Philippines celebrates [Rizal Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizal_Day), celebrating the life and works of [Jos√© Rizal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal), who gets more than an occasional mention in this blog.  I suppose that the years that I worked for a company with a Manila office rubbed off on me...

And on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the fourth.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the seventh of January.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For October, I wrote a piece about my views on **Star Trek:  Lower Decks** now that it has ended, another on a fan-favorite Christmas special's shoddy writing, discussed media consumption, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

I didn't really have anything useful, here.  The save-page feature hasn't gotten to the point of release, because I still need to work out the user interface.  But on the path to this, I realized that calling them "bookmarks" doesn't work, because so many other things use the same term, such as *browser* bookmarks.  As such, the page and URL---but not the developer-side page name---now all refer to "saved pages," rather than bookmarks.

That may change again, at some point.

Somewhat similarly, mentioning the [social-ish](/blog/socialish) posts a few times got me to check the page, where I noticed that it never picked up my name, so that should now work correctly.  It picked up the wrong configuration entry, if you care about the details.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

Like the blog's code, don't expect much from these changes, because not much actually happened.

Partly owing to not having time during the holiday season, I went here for "light duty" work.  A long time ago, I started reformatting the code for consistency---a prelude to refactoring a lot of the messy code---but never finished or committed any of it.  Without the energy to work on much else, then, it made sense to check in what I had done back-when and continue the minimal effort.

Again, not exactly a headline, but it kept me off the streets, as people used to say.

## Next

I have no idea.  We'll find out together, I suppose...
