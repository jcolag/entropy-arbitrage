## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Next Generation Season 5 Summary

I don't think that I have anything particularly interesting to say about this season, so let's jump right in...

## Conclusions

As I did with the original cast seasons, unlike the discussions of individual episodes, I'll skip the judgment calls and instead break everything down by field of practice.

Before we get moving, as usual, I feel it worth a reminder that *Star Trek* doesn't show our future.  We see deviations in the timeline, especially when the writers try to predict their futures.  I won't collect them---many people have picked apart the franchise timeline and decided how to resolve the contradictions, including the studio itself---but I wanted to make that point clear early.

### Training and Professionalism

We see strong authoritarian leanings in leadership structures, particularly in how people show that they have the ability to lead only by abusing their reports[^R] [^Di].  Leaders also seem to still ask questions so that they can interrupt the answers[^D].  Children see and emulate this behavior[^Di], as do officers who aspire to command[^U2], and outsiders see the crew as the captain's flunkies[^MT], with people of higher rank considered inherently more valuable[^PP].  They also carry the chain of command into their private relationships[^PM].

Likewise, command officers can discriminate against members of their crews based on religious and cultural traditions through rarely enforced rules[^ER] [^C].  For elites, though, an assumption exists that they'll get whatever positions that they would prefer[^G].

The Federation appears to teach that officers don't always need to follow orders, *but* that they should break rank with the intention of improving on plans[^R], rejecting the idea of violating orders on ethical or moral grounds[^ER] [^B].  It also seems routine for managers to hide information from their reports[^C] [^TA].  They will, in fact, follow the most wildly improbable orders until doing so becomes impossible, and will only question their validity then[^U2] [^B] [^TA].

The crew continues to refuse to plan ahead or prepare, even when they have lives at stake[^SA] [^TA].  They also seem to imagine that people rescuing them from their bad decisions will attack them[^SA].

People still have a toxic insistence on people seeing them as more correct, with some wanting people to treat their guesses as verified fact[^SA].  In other cases, they'll push irrelevant information into conversations[^MT], making pedantic (yet bogus) corrections[^MT] [^NG], or relaying recordings of private moments among the crew[^CE].

Officers can resign from Starfleet, then return to their jobs months later with no issues[^R].

Off-duty officers treat their official equipment carelessly[^G].

People seem so disinterested in their jobs, even while talking about impending excitement, that they'll drop everything to try a new game[^G] or to bicker[^TA].  Even in immediate danger or with colleagues working overtime, they often stand around waiting for directions[^MS] [^CL], and they continue to drink and gamble while on duty[^C] [^O] [^CE].  Similarly, after a crisis, officers will stay in place, rather than see to anything that they might have missed[^PP].  Or they send the least-qualified person to perform detailed scientific work[^O].  They also have no interest in safety protocols until the crisis has started[^V], using the safety equipment that they have[^PP], or working to maintain people's safety[^V]; they even seem afraid of reporting dangers[^IF].

They also seem to distrust people who have multiple skills[^G], and managers don't seem to trust workers to figure out their own jobs[^CL] [^IF] [^TA], though they appreciate people who sacrifice their health to sink extra hours into their work[^NP].

Starfleet doesn't appear to have any way of monitoring what the crews of their ships actually do[^G], and officers think of their organization as a moral beacon[^PP] [^FD].

### Economics

People see shame in living in unpleasant conditions, seeing it as a flaw in the residents' choices[^ER].  And yet civilian housing doesn't seem resistant to fire[^HW].

They seem to hate the idea of an economy where everybody can succeed at their jobs[^MS].

#### Colonization

The Federation seems to place colonies along borders with hostile powers, even though those could become collateral damage[^ER].  They believe that only certain kinds of personalities establish and move to colony worlds[^SA].

### Science and Technology

They strongly hint that their interest in exploring the galaxy has roots in finding better ways to kill[^B], and see animal experimentation as necessarily involving killing the subject[^B].

At least Earth continues to treat nature as a force to subjugate into convenience[^TA].

#### Design

User interfaces, as always, confound their users[^NG].  Possibly, the voice recognition systems can only handle certain accents well[^PM].

Civilians can quickly lock official users out of military computers[^SA].

Doors only work through automated systems, making them difficult to open without the computer's cooperation[^NG].  Coffee tables also seem designed to turn into shrapnel on contact[^PM].

#### Health Care

Managing illness appears to come at a cost, leaving some untreated[^ER].  If it doesn't happen at Federation hospitals, they at least find it unremarkable for a doctor to jump to the fastest diagnosis over performing a thorough investigation[^V].

Therapy continues to come off like a joke, with a counselor who appears to tune out during emergencies[^Di], might dump a patient off onto an unqualified colleague[^HW], has no understanding of or interest in ship operations[^Di], and otherwise ignores patient issues[^IF] [^B] [^TA], though sometimes seems to at least briefly try[^NG] [^B].  She doesn't seem to have any issues with mocking a patient's issues behind their backs[^TA].

People with disabilities face enough discrimination that they expect to fight over it[^MS], with their problems dismissed as something to grow accustomed to[^CE].  Medical racism also seems rampant[^E].

Medical experimentation appears to happen without a structure of informed consent[^E].

Doctors appear to still use name-brand drugs[^E].

#### Academia

The Federation still has an anti-intellectual streak, dismissing the idea of learning[^D] [^Di] [^CE], ignoring context[^D] [^V], or assume that aliens take actions for reasons[^D].  They don't do well with arithmetic[^NG], and almost refuse to acknowledge big words[^TA].  They don't seem to have a conception that people might have known different information at different points in history[^TA].

When people invoke "logic," they do so to shut down arguments for petty reasons[^U1].

Military academies teach Latin[^G].

#### Food and Drink

People seem offended by foods that deviate from their expectations[^IF].

### Crime

Many seem to take violations of the Prime Directive as a point of pride and sign of moral superiority[^MT].

Nobody really objects to college students conspiring to cover up manslaughter[^FD].

### Government, Law, and Corrections

Some people have started to understand that vague expressions of sympathy don't actually help oppressed or disadvantaged groups[^ER].

The Federation government sees both amnesty to terrorists, assassination, and working with oppressive peers as viable political processes, provided that it keeps problems outside their borders[^ER].  They dismiss the possibility of corruption[^ER] and blame the people who discover it for causing problems[^ER].

Meanwhile, the Prime Directive continues to have no concrete meaning to them, most often used to avoid responsibility for protecting people[^O].  They don't see any issues in violating it to get out of unpleasant situations[^IL], even when time traveling[^TA].

They deem at least some crimes as worthy of harsh, retributive justice with no interest in rehabilitation[^ER].

Many believe that political differences grow to divide cultures into mutually incompatible entities after only thousands of years[^U2].

The powerful can control investigations into crimes that they may have committed[^V] [^FD].  And at least before military tribunals, courts can seemingly only accept full confessions as evidence of guilt[^FD].

The Federation appears to entrust itself with an obligation to protect certain fundamental rights to all individuals under its governance[^PM].

### Ethics

They seem to only respect forms of life that have killed many others[^SA].

Supporting a close friend facing serious health problems takes a significantly lower priority than relaxing[^G].

When confronted with other cultures with non-interference principles, they try to override those principles for their own benefit[^MT].

People with authority seem to fear having people listen in on their memories[^V].

At least some people find eugenics objectionable, though that seems like a minority opinion[^MS].

They see it as appropriate to harm hostages to resolve stand-offs with less trouble[^PP].

Cheating at games seems routine, for those capable of doing so[^E] [^CE], making it difficult for people to trust each other[^CE].

### Religion

People seem to have grown more comfortable grieving losses[^NP], though they continue to voice the idea that a life that doesn't end has no meaning[^TA].

They appear to find other spiritual beliefs somewhere between uninteresting and irritating[^NP].

### Family

Despite few interactions with their own families, people have trouble imagining estranged parent-child relationships[^U1].  However, when people do have issues with family members, they get time off to deal with things properly[^NG].

Schools seem to at least imply that everybody lives in heteronormative nuclear families[^NG], and those nuclear families appear to resolve disputes by drafting informal contracts that convince the children to obey their parents[^CL].  They also expect children to scrupulously follow regulations instead of using technology to limit their movements[^IF].

#### Gender Roles

Critically, a lot of the worst aspects that we find, here, seem to come from upbringing[^C], as blocking people's memories seems to make them kinder.

We see people dismiss the idea that women can run a successful military campaign[^R] and reprimand women for following orders that disagree with their preferences[^ER], but dismiss romantic literature as the domain of women[^D].  They seem to find it important, in many cases, to discredit women[^SA] [^G] [^NP] or dismiss the issues that they raise[^MT] [^O] [^CE] [^CL] [^NP], especially as they age[^SA] [^CL].  Likewise, they delight in seeing somebody violate a woman's boundaries[^V].

By contrast, men seem compelled to validate their strength, making no compromises[^MT] [^O], taking riskier options[^MT] [^B], and needing to feel like protagonists[^NG] [^B].  It also takes decades for men to thank each other for important kindnesses[^FD].

Men also still treat women as targets for conquest[^SA] [^G] [^PM], with an expectation that the women will take passive roles in courting and relationships[^G] [^PM], and women with autonomy over their sex lives intimidates them[^PM].  This extends to grabbing the woman to pull her away from others, instead of trusting her to handle herself[^G], or judging the choices of their prospective partners after the relationship has ended[^PM], and may also extend to sexual assault[^V], with an implication that men feel entitled to sex when something arouses them[^PM].  However, they consider another man's "claim" on a woman to serve as a harsh deterrent to pursuit[^PM].

Women, meanwhile, feel the need to hide casual romantic relationships with consenting adults[^MS].

We see some vague hints at homophobia[^U1] [^O].

Schools enforce strict gender roles and heteronormative nuclear families, with events specific to traditional family roles[^NG], and people assume that only two genders exist[^IF].  People outside the gender binary get treated with a combination of disinterest, disgust, and attempts to "fix" them[^O], and do nothing to protect gender minorities from persecution unless they can directly benefit[^O].

#### Sex

Men continue to find it important to brag about sex[^SA].  However, they find nudity shocking[^CL].

People find sex work offensive[^PM].

#### Race Relations and Nationalism

We see overt racism, this season, ranging from stereotypes[^R] [^ER] [^U1] [^FD] [^CL] [^PM] [^NP] [^TA]---some of which, we see disproven[^Di]---to disbelief that people from other cultures could outfox them[^R].

The Federation views oppression through the lens of respectability politics, with "wrong" protests used as pretexts for dismissing people's needs[^ER] [^NP].  They also treat people of disadvantaged groups as either interchangeable or as needing someone to mold them[^ER] [^TA], dismissing personal experience based on what they believe about the culture[^ER], even to the point of presenting themselves as experts in the presence of that group[^U1] [^E] [^CL].  Much of this spills over to medical treatment framing certain groups as inherently problematic[^E] [^FD].

Starfleet allows command officers to discriminate against members of their crews based on religious and cultural traditions through dress codes and other rules[^ER].  It seems that immigrants and other outsiders face harsh or cruel treatment[^NG] [^B], causing them to reinforce and exaggerate their cultures as a defense[^ER] [^NG] [^HW] [^PM] [^IF] [^TA], and will rarely break character to make that point[^NG] [^IF] [^TA].  Likewise, they force foreigners to assimilate into Federation naming conventions[^ER] [^FD] [^B] [^NP] and other cultural signals[^CL].

People of certain ethnicities, such as androids, still have no civil liberties[^SA].  Many also seem to delight in tricking foreigners into revealing their ignorance or to discredit them entirely[^U2] [^B].  And they denigrate other cultures[^O] or exaggerate them to dangerous extremes[^E].

However, some have begun seeing all this as problematic[^U2].

Earth cultures still struggle to find expression, with mixed relationships finding it difficult to honor multiple traditions[^Di].  Many have moved into small ethnic enclaves[^V].

People teach children to sing songs with racialized lyrics[^Di].

Humans believe themselves to have mostly evolved beyond the majority of flaws[^V].

As mentioned with gender roles, a lot of the worst aspects that we find, here, seem to come from upbringing[^C], where blocking people's memories seems to make them less likely to indulge this sort of behavior.

#### International Relations

We see how the Federation seems to acknowledge that they have exaggerated "the Romulan threat" in how they don't deploy enough ships to critical parts of space allegedly under threat[^R] or even admit it plainly[^U2].  We also see the crew try to push the Romulans into starting a war[^R], and treat their lives as less valuable than computer technology[^NP].  Civilians believe the rhetoric against Romulans[^ER], though, and people don't even think that they can have a productive discussion[^U1].

The Romulans have a similar view of the Federation, though can better trace their concerns to actual behavior[^U1].

Likewise, even mention of the Ferengi causes fear and paranoia[^U1] [^PM], as do other hypothetical enemies[^HW], with the Borg decried as vermin to exterminate[^B].  A strange dominance posture seems to exist with other aliens, as well, working to keep them under some sort of control[^V] [^O] or attempting to intimidate them[^IF], but avoiding direct confrontation with those who show that they have any power[^V] [^IF].

People dismiss new cultures as impossible to understand[^D] [^O], but make demands even knowing that their counterparts won't understand the demands[^D] [^IL].  Likewise, when providing aid, they prioritize what they can conveniently provide over what anybody actually needs[^ER].  And they treat peaceful interactions with new cultures as almost a game of how long they can hold out before shooting someone[^D] [^C] [^O].

Starfleet seems to try to provoke wars, either through confrontation and goading[^R] or working with both sides of a terrorist attack[^ER], and they seem motivated by the chance to fight a war[^TA].  Picard also threatens to aid in a coup against a hesitant ally[^U1], and nobody seems to have a serious objection to torturing an "enemy" teenager[^B] or committing genocide through the starvation of billions[^B].  They also find it difficult to weigh asylum claims against the political stability of their oppressors[^MS] [^PP], but don't have much interest in the opinions of those asking for asylum[^MS].  Humans may have precedence over others when asking for asylum[^MS], though not always[^B].

The Federation itself continues to have a poor reputation beyond its borders[^U2] [^MS], believed to fabricate official enemies[^U2].  This includes human factions who have left Earth[^MS], though doesn't extend to all cultures[^PM].

Federation citizens give little respect to smaller foreign governments[^U1] [^V] [^O], and still appear to force everybody to communicate with them in English[^O] [^PM], using the Gregorian calendar[^NP].  However, sovereign governments appear to supply exclusive labor to the Federation for certain installations or task, with many seeing that outside government as controlling that function[^U1].

Starfleet funds the development of and monitors many minor civilian technologies, some of which turn out to have destructive potential[^NG].

### Popular Culture

People make references to Gilgamesh[^D], Shakespeare[^D], John Keats[^C], Gilbert and Sullivan[^Di], French folk music[^Di], and English nursery rhymes[^MS] [^O].

They continue to treat birthdays as major occasions[^V].

#### Socialization

Violence remains a prominent and preferred approach to solving problems[^D], along with the assumption that everybody holds the same views[^D], though they officially "regret" their violent actions[^D] or remove their agency from the descriptions[^B].  They see weapons as the most interesting historical artifacts[^TA].

They quickly move past the deaths of even people allegedly important to them[^SA].

Many treat Starfleet as the best career option for children[^Di].

Schools treat bullying as a way to build camaraderie[^G]; when they see bullying as a problem, they treat it as less of a problem than dishonesty[^NG].  Elites also assume that everybody will welcome them and remember them fondly[^G], and that people of lesser status should obey them without question[^U1], with people centering status in how they see the world[^CE].

Likewise, it offends people greatly to imagine them has having less status[^PM].

Other than interpersonal violence or romantic overtures, people seem to avoid touching each other[^NP].

#### Language

English retains idioms, complete with their original literal meanings, despite those meanings having grown obsolete[^PM].

#### Fashion

Casual civilian clothing appears to range from elegant cocktail dresses to patchwork sweaters[^G].  They don't appear to manufacture clothing for comfort or health[^CL].

#### History

They model human history as a linear succession of governments that improves on its predecessors[^D].
