Irony:  I didn't sleep well, last night, leading to this post going out unpleasantly late as I try to pull myself together...

![A cat with its foreleg covering its eyes](/blog/assets/white-sweet-animal-cute-pet-kitten-720060-pxhere.com.png "I feel you, kitty...")

A couple of years have elapsed since I last brought up this topic, and I've recently noticed a lot of people on social media posting about sleep trouble, so I wanted to update my early post on [getting a better night's sleep]({% post_url 2021-01-10-sleep %}).  I stand by the majority of what I said three years ago, so I didn't feel like it warranted rewriting that post, but have added some small steps that seem disproportionately successful and so probably worth reporting.

## Sleep Masks, Revisited

Allbirds never brought back their mask, as far as I can tell, and mine...didn't quite wear out, but the elastic eventually started giving out, and got crusty in awkward places that I'll still need to figure out how to wash.  Until I can get around to that, though, I found a somewhat cheap alternative that gets *maybe* too much praise[^1], but does the job.

[^1]: **The New York Times** sometimes makes a big deal about it, but we all know that they often make "interesting" choices that don't exactly hold up as *correct*, so maybe don't go by that.  As for the cost, I believe that they release coupons frequently, and I probably wouldn't have risked the purchase if I didn't get something like 25% off...

I don't want to add product placement---especially if I don't get anything for pushing business to them---but I will say that [Nidra](https://nidragoods.com/products/nidra-deep-rest-eye-mask-3)'s single product seems mostly close enough.  It doesn't hold up as well as the wool mask did, so you'll probably find yourself wondering if you need to replace the mask or tighten the band every few months, *but* the elastic does come on a Velcro-like strap to make tightening easier, and it mostly does the job.

They definitely designed it for travel instead of daily use, though.

## Earplugs

In summer, I have a peculiar problem.  I can sleep without an air conditioner fine, as you can guess, and I can sleep with an air conditioner running all night, but in modern times, air conditioners run in "eco-mode," which stops when it has cooled the room.  Turning off, however, consistently wakes me up.

I solved this problem with cheap earplugs, the kind that you get dozens or hundreds of in a huge box cheaply at any office or industrial supply outlet.  They don't seem to block any actual noise, so I can hear pretty much anything, but it dampens the shock of rapid changes, like the unit shutting itself down.

## The Military Method

Allegedly developed by the United States Navy during World War II and recently rediscovered by bloggers and apparently some social media influencers, this made the rounds, and I played with it a bit.  Note that nobody seems to have mentioned any studies, so we you'll want to mostly take it as somebody's article of faith that *somebody* investigated this at some point and found that, after a few weeks of practice, fighter pilots in war zones could fall asleep quickly enough to not have performance problems.

Everybody reports the process looking like these five steps.

 * Relax your facial muscles, paying particular attention to inside your mouth.
 * Inhale quickly and exhale slowly, five times.
 * Relax your shoulders, arms, and hands.
 * Clear your mind for ten seconds, usually by picturing a relaxing setting or drowning out your thoughts with useless noise.
 * Relax your legs.

I looked at it partially optimistically, because I recognize some of the steps.  The first, third, and fifth steps fall under what we often call [progressive muscle relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_muscle_relaxation), and does generally help overall relaxation.  The second step, I think that everybody recognizes as an alleged trigger for slowing the heart-rate.  And everybody has suggested clearing minds for an easier sleep.  In other words, this at least *sounds* promising.

On the skeptical side, though, I notice that this moves quickly and provides little to no guidance on how to make those five things happen.  Therefore, I experimented to find something that at least works for me.

### Adapting the Method

In my case, because of the problems mentioned above, I use the second step as the template for the other four steps, to keep a steady pace through things.  Every step takes five deep breaths, inhaling as quickly as possible without feeling abrasive, and exhaling as slowly as possible.  I also start by *tensing* my muscles, as close to head-to-toe as I can manage, including elevating my arms and legs.

In this case, the first step relaxes facial and neck muscles on the fifth breath.  The second step does nothing but focus on breathing.  The third step slowly lowers my arms to the bed's surface.  Sometimes, pushing my arms down into the mattress helps, tensing them in another way to release that tension.

For the fourth step, I visualize someplace quiet, often little more than looking up at the night sky, maybe from water.  If I can, I also try to imagine something in my hands, while also focusing on my balance.  I usually lose track of most of that, which solves the "clear your mind" part.

Then, I slowly relax my feet and lower my legs down to the mattress.  Finally, much like ending the arm-and-shoulder-relaxation step by pushing into the mattress, I do the same with my head, arms, and feet, for a final five breaths, again making sure that I relax from a different direction.  I try to maintain the visualization through these steps.

That seems to work consistently.  I haven't tried it in any extreme connections---unpleasant heat, excessive noise, personal stress, and so forth---but with the mask, noise machine, and earplugs when needed, it at least feels like I drop directly off to sleep.

## Aside: Catching up

I should mention that I've read in a few places that you "can't" catch up on sleep, implying that a couple of nights of bad sleep will more average out over time than rectify itself.  I don't know the actual science, here, but I will note that anecdotally, I have found that you probably can't catch up *intentionally*.

However, a few days after missing sleep---usually because I get carried away on a project, forget to wear my red-tinted glasses, and stay up far too late---then I'll end up sleeping in over a couple of days coming surprisingly close to evening out.  I know, because I use my [**Morning Dashboard**](https://github.com/jcolag/dash) to graph sleep length and a proxy for sleep quality.

If this holds for most people, not necessarily a legitimate theory but *if* valid, it means that catching up happens fairly naturally, if you give it some time, rather than trying to push it.

## Zzzzz

I don't think that I have anything else to report, here.  I'd especially love a source for those safety glasses that doesn't go through Amazon---especially since I don't shop there, and they cancelled my affiliate code repeatedly for the crime of not earning them enough money...---but that doesn't seem likely in the near future.
