This goes out a bit late for all the usual reasons for a Sunday post, but we'll talk a bit about education, this week.

![Students in Chitral attending class](/blog/assets/6205922257_246ef183e6_o.png "Embarrassing confession?  Until I noticed the gender segregation, I thought this came from the United States, on account of the nasty-looking walls and poor lighting...")

Before we get there, though, let's give this post some broader context...

## Thirty Million Dollar Preface

Back in January, a group of Silicon Valley folks launched their [Free Our Feeds <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://freeourfeeds.com/) campaign, a buzzword-laden, [shady-looking](https://tante.cc/2025/01/13/but-does-it-free-our-feeds/) initiative that aims to raise anywhere between four and thirty million dollars, forecasting an eventual need for *hundreds* of millions, to create a foundation that would attempt building a second server ("relay") for Bluesky's AT protocol, and *maybe* create some other applications using the protocol.

You could---as the second link does---ask what makes this different from Bluesky Public Benefit Corporation.  You could ask why it takes millions of dollars to create (not run) a social media server that only follows an existing protocol, and [Bluesky already releases source code](https://github.com/bluesky-social).  Heck, you could even ask (as I did in a comment on that post) why they seem to entirely ignore Christine Lemmer-Webber's [post about Bluesky's potential decentralization](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/) in their plan, which seems to suggest that they might not get too far.  Other questions arise, too.  Why bother lavishing so much attention on AT, when ActivityPub already does more than they want?  Why do so many of their nine "custodians" have deep connections to LLM startups?  Couldn't those nine custodians, mostly wealthy in their own right, scrape up their "minimum" of four million dollars between them, if this project strikes them as so important?  Do they think that anybody will support this because Mark Ruffalo---owning assets worth tens of millions in his own right---signed their open letter?

Me, though?  I'd rather ask how one raises thirty million dollars and, if somebody wanted to give me that kind of money, what I could accomplish with it primarily relating to and supporting Free Culture.  That leads me to the first of these [thirty million dollar](/blog/tag/30-million) posts.  I envision it as an irregular, occasional series where I---ideally *we*, but I realize that getting involved feels like it takes commitment---think through some in-an-ideal-world projects, at least partly for entertainment purposes.  But in an *ideal* (and redundant) ideal world, I also hope that somebody might point out that, as a community, we could do this all at no cost and kick off the project.

OK, in an even-better-than-ideal world, I wouldn't turn thirty million dollars down to make these things happen.  That doesn't seem particularly likely, though.  But call me {% emoji telephone receiver %} with offers...

In short, think of these posts as somewhere between a laugh at the small imaginations/high costs of the modern software industry and wishful thinking of the things that we could have with enough resources.

Our inaugural project?  Using Free Culture as the basis for an educational system that does more of what we expect modern education to give students and less of what we've inherited from past generations.

## Many Faces of Education

I've said many times---probably at least once on the blog---that a formal education often serves a handful of purposes.  We need some, in the sense that we can't reliably reproduce them through informal means.  We value some, because we don't believe that we can reliably reproduce them otherwise.  And we accept a lot, because it doesn't seem reasonable to overhaul an entire system, especially when we can't form a cohesive vision of what education should do and have open discussions about it.

As a result of that failure, we get bizarre educational systems.  Some students receive the equivalent of vocational training, because somebody decided that education should prepare you for a job.  Others get college preparation classes that prioritize helping them game the applications process.  At the extremes, some schools prioritize occupying students for long enough that parents don't need to pay for babysitting, without much interest in what the students get out of the deal.  Increasingly, we see education that aims to rewrite the world by eliminating ideas or people from consideration.

Before we get going, then, let's talk about what schools actually accomplish, regardless of what we want them to teach.

### Motivation

I generally argue that school has no use or purpose more important than making you learn things even when they don't fit your youthful priorities.  Using myself as an example and hoping that I can remember enough to make this worthwhile, public schools taught me math (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and more), various sciences (Earth science, biology, chemistry, physics, biotechnology, computer programming, and maybe others), appreciation of literature, writing for various purposes, typing, French, a bit of Spanish, a bit of Russian, global history, American history, civics, economics, painting, playing the recorder, playing the violin, the more common sports and a few that I've never seen outside a gym class, sewing, baking, welding, woodworking, digital electronics, public speaking, and probably a bunch of other things that I've forgotten over the decades, to say nothing about forcing me to socialize with people who I (for the most part) probably would have never chosen.

Would I have learned all of those if left to my own devices?  No, I would've prioritized "hard sciences" and languages, but ignored most of the rest.  Some of the big list came from or matched my own inclinations, but most either came from requirements or teachers asking me to fill a spot in a class that needed to run.  Do I use all of it?  No, I barely use any of it beyond the programming that I really already knew at the time from my own projects, though I sometimes return to one of the half-forgotten skills for a project.  Did I learn to love all of it?  No, but I learned to love a lot more than I would've expected.  And I can appreciate most of it.  And those feel like the big lessons, here, that you *might* learn about something that you actually want to do more and, even if not, you have a sense of what it looks like to do those things well.  While I didn't care about soccer/association football, other students in the class did enjoy it enough to try out for the team[^1].  I thought that the recorder wasted my time and the couple of dollars that it cost, but now that I own a 3D printer, I *do* feel tempted to print myself one to occasionally play music.

[^1]:  In the spirit of disclosure, I don't think that I have the right to divulge their name, but I went to school with somebody who went on to win a silver medal at the Olympics and more in soccer.  Given our age, coming from the United States, I doubt that their exposure to the sport came from outside school...

Without the school there, most of us would probably only work on the subjects that already interested us and don't challenge us too much.  And I don't think that anybody would praise it if we let teenagers chart the course of the rest of their lives.

### Networking

This might sound cynical, but by showing up to a class somewhere, you have an opportunity to meet and get to know people who will eventually populate the outside world.  They only look like fellow students while you take the class, but those people have a decent chance of becoming your doctor, electrician, or whatever.

This tends to apply more in college, sure, since the majority of people tend to settle near where they went to college and get similar jobs.  College classmates often become your direct colleagues.  Schooling prior to that, however, has a decent chance of forming your broader community.  And either way, school provides an in-built reason to get to know these people, reasons to connect with people and form relationships.

Alas, I don't think that anywhere other than elite institutions understand this, and most schools actively play this aspect down.  Many colleges have even scrapped this idea as they've shifted classes online and reduced the areas of the campus that enables that sort of casual networking.

### Credentials

Schools also---often critically, for a period after you graduate---provide grades and transcripts.  This often seems like an afterthought, but schools (give or take some issues) provide a mostly objective assessment of every student's work.  Until the student has a work history, along with colleagues who can vouch for them, that transcript becomes the only real way of guessing how a candidate might perform in higher education, a job, or other professional environment.

In many cases, the schools get their own assessments, ensuring that they teach a certain minimum body of material and have consistent standards.

By awarding diplomas and other credentials, schools at least start to validate that the students performed at least a certain amount of work.

### Exposure

Finally, though linked strongly to the motivation aspect, we have the fact that schools present information for students to learn and apply.

We often tend to think of this as the core responsibility of schools, and I think that it leads to some big problems.  For example, it leads to a cohort of people who want to suggest that, because the Internet now has so much information on it, we no longer need schools, which...I wrote the prior sections specifically so that we don't need to take that seriously.

However, even though I might call the presentation of topics the least important aspect of schooling, we also have the greatest control over it from that same perspective that leads people to want to ignore it.

Likewise, given the structure of a school, it also has the greatest impact.  I doubt that any of us thinks back fondly to a deadline for a project, and your credentials don't really matter once you have work experience and other people who can speak to your abilities in a more specific context.  But I'd bet that *everybody* remembers getting hooked on an unexpected subject, and some of you might have even chosen careers based on that revelation.

## Free Education

Ever since I *attended* school, I have wanted to create a more aggressive and (especially) a more engaging curriculum.  And given the [current US administration's views on education](https://theconversation.com/trumps-executive-order-to-dismantle-the-education-department-was-inspired-by-the-heritage-foundations-decades-long-disapproval-of-the-agency-250605), it seems like a good idea to talk about how Free Culture could give students (and rebellious teachers) a leg up.

You'll notice that I don't mean [Open Educational Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).  Or rather, technically I *do* mean OER, in the most abstract, but not in the boring "make mundane educational material available under a license that allows ownership and distribution" sense of the term.  Rather, I mean capitalizing on the current crisis to build the foundation of a better system, probably ultimately using a lot of OER projects.

Let's start with a class that probably irked all of us at some point.

### Literature

Why start with literature?  In short, I think that has the strongest and fastest impact on the topics that we expose students to.

And it especially feels relevant today, when we in the United States have members of the Supreme Court [falsely insisting that he read a children's encouraging readers to look for a sex worker engaging in bondage work](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2024/24-297_p8k0.pdf#:~:text=leather%20and),[^2] and our incoherent president---the fake one barely elected, I mean, not the immigrant with fraudulent paperwork who actually runs the administration---wants to replace education with, I guess, [Confederate statues down by the river](https://theconversation.com/what-the-history-of-iconoclasm-tells-us-about-the-confederate-statue-controversy-82878) alongside a [bunch of celebrities](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-building-rebuilding-monuments-american-heroes/) for some reason.

[^2]:  And by the way, I should bring up one of my pet peeves with the people talking about the case in question:  Can we stop bashing sex workers as a kind of "thing" that kids won't otherwise know about?  Assuming that I didn't learn about the existence of sex workers from their proliferation on sitcoms and cop shows, which most kids watch with nobody complaining, I remember growing up hearing interviews with Dolly Parton, where she'd talk about how she modeled her public persona on *the most respectable person* in her hometown, a sex worker who held her "office hours" at the local bar.  I really don't think that we need to back-pedal and placate when some conservative weirdo hallucinates a sex worker around every corner.  We could far more usefully ask them if they have an objection to entrepreneurs running small businesses to support the needs of their community.

Seriously, everybody.  They think that metal replicas of Marion "John Wayne" Morrison will protect us from the scourge of the throngs of fictional dominatrices that they fever-dreamed up, like an even goofier, more expensive, and more bigoted version of a [kitchen witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_witch). {% emoji flag united states %}

Anyway, here goes the thirty-million-dollar proposal:  Building, curating, and making available a usable curriculum, drawn from Free Culture and the public domain, that an underserved student, rebellious teacher, home-schooling parent, or casual learner could use without sacrificing any diversity and *maybe* even getting something more out of it than they would have otherwise.  And I see literature as the centerpiece of this.

Why start (and maybe, for the sake of this post, end) with a literature curriculum, though?  It'll rub some people the wrong way, but---at least in the United States public schools---we have a handful of departments in our schools under various names.

- Art and Music
- English, responsible for grammar, literature, and writing.
- Foreign Language, often to satisfy some requirement.
- Mathematics, which I hope that I don't need to explain.
- Physical Education, your typical gym class.
- Science, which I similarly hope that I don't need to explain.
- Social Studies, mainly responsible for history, but also including culture, economics, and civics.
- whatever else the school can afford to support.

Notice that at least four of those departments---language, math, gym, and science---don't lend themselves to improvement through a new curriculum.  We could improve how students learn the relevant topics, but it'd take a radical restructuring of how those classes operate, not a new science book or sport.  Art and music classes tend (as I recall) to take more free-form approaches, and they don't come from an art appreciation standpoint, so a collection wouldn't make much sense.  That leaves the English and social studies departments, unless a particular school can support a technology (shop), home economics, business, or other department.  In other words, we can only *really* talk about two of the possibilities in the scope of a blog post.

And while history certainly feels like the more pressing issue at the moment, I also feel woefully unqualified to talk about it in this context.  I could point you to [**The American Yawp**](https://www.americanyawp.com/) as a possible starting point for American history, though it ties itself strongly to the [Great Man Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) of history at a time when we need more [history from below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_history), and you can already see how this gets mired, even before we start considering the political bias in trying to assemble a historical narrative where almost everybody mentioned has died, and a lot of the people who lost their fights didn't get to tell their own stories in a way that we can access them.

Plus, remember, this post has the premise of a thirty-million-dollar project.  If I could do the entire thing in one post, I'd happily do it in one post, no charge...

### Examples

{% imgr Hester Prynne cradling Pearl|scarlet-letter-hester-pearl-merle.png|A baby of that size must grow up to become a kaiju, right...? %}

As maybe my favorite example of where schooling feels like it goes wrong, my class and probably yours needed to slog through [**The Scarlet Letter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter), which...I don't think interests any teenager, spurs them to more deeply analyze prose, or spark a love of reading.  The symbolism beats you over the head so hard that it might not actually qualify as symbolism anymore.  The story feels, to the aforementioned teenagers, like it wants to both condemn extramarital sex, because *all* media fed to teenagers does, and laugh at the narrow-minded Puritans for doing exactly that same thing.  And without anybody to teach the class about Asenath Smith---the woman whose thoroughly botched 1817 abortion by her preacher-lover led to a century of brutal abortion bans and probably inspired many aspects of Hawthorne's story---the book has no real context or relevance, even though it *could* feel highly relevant to a lot of the modern day.

In other words, teachers almost always miss the book's single best opportunity to educate---almost certainly because nobody taught it to them---instead focusing on the surface aspects that hold almost no interest for the audience.

And yet, later in life, I might go so far as to call Hawthorne one of my favorite classic authors, even though I still don't care about Arthur Dimmesdale anymore than you do.  You see, he *also* wrote a variety of science fiction and fantasy---or precursors to the genres, at least---stories, with the same care and attention that he shows Hester Prynne and company.  Take [*The Artist of the Beautiful*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mosses_from_an_Old_Manse/The_Artist_of_the_Beautiful) or [*Rappaccini's Daughter*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mosses_from_an_Old_Manse/Rappaccini%27s_Daughter) as quick examples.  We have the same sorts of resonant characters, the same kinds of symbolism, and the same relevance to modern conversations, but in far shorter forms and without needing someone to let you in on some secret historical aspect that makes sense of it.  In other words, we could introduce Nathaniel Hawthorne's work to students through stories with similarly excellent prose that also coincidentally entertain.  Without teaching the historical context of the various stories, can anybody tell me why we as a culture would want students to care about the novel, but not the shorter pieces?

{% imgr Celestial Eyes by Francis Cugat, the 1925 cover for The Great Gatsby|Celestial-Eyes-Great-Gatsby-Francis-Cugat-1925.png|In West Egg, book reads you %}

We don't and shouldn't limit this conversation to one author, though, because if we wanted to give American students an education in literature through Free Culture works, in the public domain or under appropriate licenses that empower them to work with the text as if they owned it, we can do *far* better than schools currently often do.  For example, why did my schools never assign me reading from non-white authors?  Why did they never assign anything closer to the LGBT experience than, if you squint and tilt your head, you can convince yourself of Nick Carraway's bisexuality[^3] in [**The Great Gatsby**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby) or that book with...those boys at their elite boarding school, maybe one of them comes off as vaguely gay-coded; I vaguely remember a kid falling out of a tree, maybe.  But you get my point.  We get served up white writers, mostly men, who wrote entirely in English about their own problems, in eras when you didn't talk about certain subjects.

[^3]:  Please don't take that as dismissive of the idea of reading marginalized identities into classic works.  Personally, I can only really tolerate **The Great Gatsby** if we think of a [probably Black <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/great-gatsby-book-fitzgerald-race-interpretation/672778) Jay Gatsby as assembling a group of outsiders forcing their way into high society.  Daisy shows more than a bit of independence as a woman, while her white supremacist husband Tom outright hints that she has mixed ancestry.  Nick gets out of bed with a man.  Jordan has fingers "powdered white over their tan."  Gatsby himself has a "brown body," buys a forty-acre estate, and "his career as Trimalchio" recently ended, the last naming a [former slave from an Ancient Roman story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimalchio).

We can build a better curriculum than *that*.

Imagine having students read the likes of [**Iola Leroy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iola_Leroy), [**Journey to the West**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West), [**Co=ge=we=a**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogewea), [**Indulekha**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulekha_%28novel%29), [**Nevada**]({% post_url 2024-06-08-nevada-1 %}), [**American Dream**]({% post_url 2022-10-08-american-dream-1 %}), and other books that, while they probably won't all excite every reader, have a far better chance of resonating with parts of the audience than...I don't know, [**Ethan Frome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Frome), maybe.  While I know that Edith Wharton has her fans, bleak and tedious doesn't feel like it fits the spirit of the exercise, no matter what you want to argue about the nature of morality in the book.  I'd much rather see books spotlighting different walks of life.

Therefore, I propose---or would if I didn't have so much else on my plate---to build a curriculum from Free Culture sources.  Give the kids better Hawthorne, not to mention works by under-represented populations, both because they deserve exposure and such a "canon" of works thumbs its nose at awful people.  For example, while I didn't particularly enjoy reading [**Nevada**]({% post_url 2024-06-08-nevada-1 %}), most students would probably at least see the value of reading it, and all would get something from it.  What works could we pull out of the public domain *globally*, to expand this canon in useful ways?  To revisit something else from the last paragraph, I'd rather have read [**Journey to the West**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West) than the shocking number of books that tried to make Greek mythology "sensible," for example.  Imagine students learning works from all over the world, on a variety of topics, instead of a parade of coming-of-age stories that try to sell us on the "plight" of angry white boys.

And, as Free Culture---with explicit public licenses or in the public domain---the students have permission to adapt the works however they please.  More on this in a bit.

## Why Thirty Million

I've hinted at this, but I do want to explicitly talk about what would make this a possible "thirty-million-dollar project."  (Presumably, nobody needs me to explain why the project would benefit more people than the Bluesky nonsense.)

In short, a project like this would require plenty of effort.  Even if we only limited the project to literature, we'd need to find and evaluate candidate books among a massive global public domain.  To ensure a diverse crop of writers, books not originally published in English should have professional, modern translations placed under a Free Culture license, as well as translations of the books into other languages for the rest of the world to use.

Each book should also come with a lesson plan, which goes beyond the bland, uncontroversial questions that ask about the book's plot or the most blatant symbolism.  Each plan should explain the historical and cultural context in enough detail to make the relevance of the book unavoidable, while providing pointers for deeper research.

The plans should also consider modern reinterpretations of the stories, asking students to consider the evidence for and against those ideas.  Because most books will come from the increasingly distant past, the books should include content advisories, so that students can prepare themselves for traumatizing issues.  I mean, why *not* have the books introduce students to the fallout from Asenath Smith's pregnancy or the likely identity politics---you read that footnote, right?---of Jay Gatsby and his cronies?

And because of those issues and the complexity of the texts, each book also needs some assessment of *where* it belongs in the curriculum, when students would most likely have enough preparation to engage with the ideas.

And *then* we have the other subjects.

English classes also need writing lessons, which---I see the idea coming together wonderfully, here---can springboard from the literature.  This can take form in both essays and creative writing.  Let's take a look at a quick examples of each, riffing on some of the prior examples of possible literature, no guarantees of a solid exam question.

- In **Nevada**, the protagonist figuratively gives advice to her younger self.  What advice would you expect your future self to anonymously give you?  How would you process it?  (Or, for older students, what advice would you give your past self, and how would *they* take it?)
- Continue *Rappaccini's Daughter*, following Giovanni as he deals with the results of the massive experiment.
- With a partner (or an appropriate number of partners), adapt a critical scene from (pick literally any book in the curriculum) and present it in front of the class.

On that last, we often (rightly) bemoan a lack of funding for the arts in schools.  And while this doesn't *solve* it, we now have entire musicals in the public domain, and plenty of material that clever young writers could adapt into other forms, which should reduce the overall need substantially.  That works especially well, when classes feed them the source material.

English classes also need instruction in the language, spelling at lower levels, grammar as the students advance.

Social studies, I would argue, probably needs everything rebuilt from scratch.  As mentioned, these times and the Free Culture ethos both demand a history from below, and one that encourages examining primary sources to understand what happened and why.  Economics and civics, similarly, deserve a ground-up construction that actually treats the subjects empirically instead of throwing unworkable theories at students and hoping that they don't notice.  And culture, similar to writing, could grow out of the study of literature, talking about their influences, what they mean in context, and how that affects what we see today.

As mentioned, math and science probably need a complete conceptual overhaul.  Right now, we fragment the subjects inside and treat them as sterile, abstract ideas, then wonder why students don't think that they've gotten any use from it.  By contrast, we *could* start classes with complicated problems, maybe even a tactile problem that the students need to deal with, and break that down into the knowledge that they'll need to solve the problem, which may provide further opportunities to teach in some cases.  A "lesson" should take weeks, branching and merging, until the students learn bits of different mathematical and scientific fields, until they put those skills together for the final answer.

Similarly, art and music classes could become a combination of experimentation/practice and (as gestured at earlier) appreciation, looking at curated collections of art to talk about what makes those pieces resonate with people.  And...probably something similar with physical education, but I honestly haven't the foggiest idea what that could look like.

In fact, we really only have field where a project like this wouldn't need massive amounts of research and analysis:  Foreign languages.  For almost eighty years, the [United States Foreign Services Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Service_Institute) has published comprehensive self-study materials for most major languages, as have our [Defense Language Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Language_Institute) and [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps).  Several small companies have collected the physical media and digitized them to [make the courses available](https://www.livelingua.com/fsi/) for streaming or download.  If you want to learn [Q'eqchi'](https://www.livelingua.com/project/peace-corps/q%27eqchi%27), [Cambodian](https://www.livelingua.com/project/fsi/cambodian), or military-appropriate [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.livelingua.com/project/dli/chinese/mandarin), you could do worse than start with one of the courses that the United States government previously used to get their people up to speed.

However, even there, most of these courses came out in the 1960s, and could presumably use an update.  For example, I would bet that most languages from former Soviet Republics have gone through intense changes in the past thirty-or-so years, as the relevant countries asserted their independence.  In all cases, terminology comes and goes, and words for new technologies pile up.  You'll have trouble expressing "leak me your classified war crimes in the Signal group chat" or "if we smash the patriarchy after burning late-stage capitalism to the foundation, will we still have time to grab lunch?" to your Igbo-speaking comrades, in other words.

Not only that, but a project like this can't get dumped over a wall for people to accidentally find.  It would need people to spread to word, to solicit and act on feedback, and keep things up to date.  If political situations get worse, a project like this might need a legal team to defend some brave teacher accused of woke-ing all over the place with science based on data, economics that doesn't believe that we all act like calculating, self-serving creeps with no empathy or personal connections, pointing out the harms that slavery caused to society, or acknowledging the existence of transgender people.

Think of that in terms of thirty million dollars.  If we pay people decent professional wages where they don't need to sacrifice the health of their families---not even *competitive* wages---that comes to something like two hundred person-years with a benefits package, ignoring expenses like hosting.  That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that this project probably doesn't bring in much revenue, if any, so how long would you want the material to stay up to date?  If you want it to survive for a decade instead of throwing a package of content over the wall, then that becomes a staff of only twenty to handle all the above, actually fewer than twenty, since people will need raises as the cost of living increases.

Actually, I can think of a way for this to make money, by supplying the three key elements of a school that I outlined at the top.  Charge for credentials, maybe resting on top of [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/), deadlines in the form of opportunities to acquire the credentials, and opportunities to build a professional network *could* also make this self-sustaining, but only after the organization had enough of a reputation that those credentials or networking events would mean anything.  And that could take a while, so the same rough analysis would hold.

## Wrapping Up

Note that this wouldn't solve every problem with our constantly under-siege education systems.  At best, it serves as the "construction material" for educators and students to build something to defend themselves.  But a project like this would at least provide a place to start filling in gaps left by schools for students, or filling in gaps left by the entire system for schools.

I have no intention of taking this on.  Alone, I'd never finish in my lifetime.  With an army of volunteers, it could happen, but I'd feel guilty for that many people not getting support for their altruism.  But if somebody wanted to throw a few million dollars my way, I could probably make it happen...

And heck, as long as we've gone down the road of joking about giving me money, I might as well quietly remind anybody making it down this far---and thank you for enduring this goofy idea for a post---that you could throw me significantly less than thirty million dollars through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jcolag/), or even [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/dR614J5vM8na9eU9AA) directly, if you so desired. {% emoji person shrugging %}

I really only add those because the topic turned to paying me for things.  Please, nobody feel obliged.  Although, if you want to provide a symbolic contribution to this hypothetical project, pitch me your favorite public domain or explicitly Free Culture literature down in the comments or over in [the blog's Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org), especially if your pick steps outside the usual American fare featuring (predominantly) angsty white guys who want direction in their lives...
