As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > For example, more than one in three of the families were at or below the federal poverty line. As a result, these families often moved more frequently and lived in less safe neighborhoods.

This probably won't come as a surprise to anybody.  My family moved frequently during most of my teenage years for various reasons, and I frequently feel myself fighting---or trying to productively channel, as you might have noticed over the years---the urge to act out, even decades later.  At least I usually have the luxury of spaces where people appreciate those impulses, but few people do.

 > In 1791, President George Washington ordered Secretary of War Henry Knox to destroy farms and livestock of the Wea Tribe that lived along the Ohio River valley – a fertile area with a long history of growing corn, beans, squash and other fruits and vegetables.

Hashtags:  #Famine #Gaza #History #IndigenousPeoples

This has always made the Gaza situation so much more galling, the hedging and wondering if this really might qualify as an attack, when it has happened so often in history.  And surely, that probably plays into it.  If we admit that this adds to the evidence in favor of ethnic cleansing, then we need to own up to our own histories, whether the United States, Canada, or even Russia, which doesn't like people bringing up the evidence in favor that the Kremlin might have orchestrated the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) in retaliation for the Ukrainian push for independence fifteen years prior.

As an aside, this post led some weirdo to try to pressure me to take it down on the basis of the headline including the word "indigenous."  You see, objected to tying Palestinians with indigenous populations elsewhere in the world, rather than Jewish people---after the boilerplate insincere acknowledgement that we shouldn't starve people---comparing it to quoting the KKK or **Mein Kampf**, which...no, and the comparison exposed that he wanted me to help suppress the article about forced starvation, not express a concern about vocabulary.

I spotted the bad-faith argument immediately when they urged somebody in my "position" to chose my words carefully---presumably confusing me with the author of the article---wanting to pick a fight so that they had an excuse to decry me as anti-Semitic, so I mostly mocked his position before muting the creep.  Though I don't think that he has entirely gone away, since I have had a sorry attempt at a denial-of-service attack against my website[^1] since around the time that I replied to him.

[^1]:  Normally, I wouldn't level an accusation like that, but minutes after my interaction with this person, my analytics started registering hundreds of hits, from around the world, but with no URL in the request.  That adds up to a deliberate attack, in my eyes, even though it hasn't gotten far.

My opinion on the matter?  First, no, a settler-colonial population does not get to claim the title of "indigenous population," regardless of whether their ancestors lived in the area[^2].  The descendants of a diaspora don't become indigenous when they move to their ancestors' homeland.  Describing someone as "indigenous to" an area---having origins there---does not make them part of the indigenous population, and to suggest otherwise blatantly invokes blood-and-soil eugenics, the idea that certain racial groups (race only existing because of racism, remember) "belong" on certain plots of land with their own kind.

[^2]:  [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) on the subject, in fact, identifies a cultural distance from the state and an experience of discrimination in their own territory, beyond the connection with the land.  In other words, even if you can point to an unbroken residency since the first multicellular organisms arose, if you have authority in the area, nobody calls you an indigenous group.

My other opinion?  The headline doesn't even *call* the Gazans indigenous, only draws a parallel between Israeli actions and historical incidents of genocide.  But you can't rightly expect literacy from right-wing trolls.

None of that means that Israelis somehow don't belong in their homes, by the way.  They do.  Immigrants and the descendants of settlers become part of that place, even if they got there through unpleasant means, and I will always fight for the safety of Jewish folks wherever they live.  But they don't get the role of the put-upon indigenous population in their expansionist ethnostate, even though that title would make it easier for their government to maintain the expansionist ethnostate.

At this point, whether Trump faces legal consequences doesn't matter.  Every moment that we force them to spend defending against this mess, they can't put that time towards anything else.  That has much more value, in the short term.

The lack of trust serves an important purpose, here.  When people don't trust institutions, historically, organized crime thrives.  Trump's allies both fit in well with the organized crime set, and can then use that crime as evidence that we need more policing.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

Unfortunately, the spread of Dropsite’s story is relatively small, and there haven’t been any other public statements about the list at this time. This makes it difficult to adequately critique the initial story, but the concept is nevertheless a wake-up call.

Show of hands, who finds this at all surprising?  Nobody?  I figured.

Honestly, this seems especially silly, since they could use Threads to scrape up almost everything without anybody really questioning it.  But privileged people don't really do well with critical thinking, in my experience.
