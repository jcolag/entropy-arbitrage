## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Pegasus

Since last week, over on **Deep Space Nine**, Odo needed to come to terms with his figurative parental issues and the possible existence of another of his kind, in *The Alternate*.  Meanwhile, you'll want to strap in, for this episode, because it may not relate to our overall project, but I have a *lot* to talk about...

 > **PICARD**: I don't know why we have to do this every year. I thought that last year the teachers had agreed that they wouldn't do this anymore.
 >
 > **TROI**: Captain Picard Day is one of the children's favorite school activities. They look forward to it all year.

No matter how often they try to sell his discomfort, I can't shake the impression that he fights for that adulation.  I mean, "the teachers had agreed" to end it, and we have never seen a kid on this show treat Picard as particularly interesting, so if the children drive the practice, then "outside agitators" must have gotten involved to force it.

Can we blame it (entirely) on the minions, given how much they seem to enjoy it?  Maybe, and that level of toadying does seem like Troi's wheelhouse.  But especially given the themes of the episode, how do you think it shakes out when Riker sidles up to someone, asks about their children, then asks for the parents to electioneer for Dear Leader?  I'd bet that the space-PTA rats him out before he gets back to his station, because none of these lower-level officers wants to get in the middle of a petty political struggle.

Given that, this all must happen with Picard's approval, no matter what he claims.

 > **PICARD**: Isn't there something else you have to do?

...Did I accidentally write this script?

 > **BLACKWELL**: Good. I'm postponing the quasar study for the moment. The *Enterprise* is to rendezvous with the starship *Crazy Horse* in sector one six zero seven immediately. You're authorized to exceed warp speed limitations for the duration of this assignment.

The ship last got a mention in [*Descent*]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}), as I mentioned there, named for the nineteenth century [Lakota war leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse).

Also, notice our first mention of spacetime conservation "in the wild," where...they tell us not to worry about it.  I find that especially funny, because nothing about this episode requires speed, meaning that they brought it up (a) to assure us that [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}) really happened, and (b) to assure us that it doesn't matter.  In that post, I asked what counts as an "emergency" that allows them to disregard the rule, and this episode tells us that potential political embarrassment suffices.

 > **BLACKWELL**: I'd prefer not to discuss it over subspace channels. The *Crazy Horse* will be carrying someone from Starfleet Intelligence. He'll brief you when he arrives.

You know, other than a passing mention in [*Gambit*]({% post_url 2025-06-19-gambit-part-1 %}), I believe that this makes the first time that we've gotten any sense of an intelligence arm.  We have heard of the occasional "agent," especially (as in this episode) moles in the Romulan government, but people generally hand-wave what they do and who they actually work for.

And that *might* suggest a popular or political aversion to espionage, which sounds almost absurd today, but in the United States, Woodrow Wilson testified that it came as a brutal shock to learn that every European country maintained a "secret service" to spy on each other.  Before Wilson, William Howard Taft's Secretary of War Henry Stimson famously shut down the Cipher Bureau on the basis that "gentlemen do not read each other's mail."  Both later changed their minds, but that context shows that the Federation could have an aversion to the practice.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, er, yes. It's---er---it's for the children. I'm...er, ha-ha, I'm a role model.
 >
 > **BLACKWELL**: I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.

See?  This makes *no sense*, unless Picard wants it.  Even the admiral thinks so.

 > **PICARD**: Yes. Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for a Commander Riker Day next month. I'm even considering making an entry myself.

Oh, wait, as an exercise in making a disposable effigy of a powerful, out-of-touch person, I think that I can start to see the appeal of Captain Picard Day.  Presumably, the *real* festival happens the day after, but they don't invite fleshy Picard to that one...

 > **PRESSMAN**: Will. I'll bet you never thought you'd see me again.

You almost *certainly* recognize Pressman, played by [Terry O'Quinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_O%27Quinn), who feels like he has shown up everywhere, but you probably know him best for his role on **Lost**, though I don't, because I never bothered to watch it.  Where I recognize him from, though, I couldn't tell you...

 > **PRESSMAN**: The *Pegasus* is still out there, Will. And the Romulans found her.

I don't talk about the structure of the show, much, but I really need to point out how the fact that *this line* serves as the teaser's cliffhanger says so much about how (at least) the characters view the Romulans.  I mean, they left some junk out in space and another culture found it, right?  That barely seems interesting, let alone a shocking revelation to keep us tuned in past the credits.

And yes, the two characters speaking know that the situation has more nuance than that, but they need to sell it to us, meaning that the presence of Romulans should have them (us) rattled, not the survival of the *Pegasus*.

Oh, and speaking of which, for those of you who didn't have some version of Ancient Greek mythology poured down your throat the sea-and-horse god Poseidon got Medusa pregnant, and when Perseus decapitated her, winged-horse [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus) and (non-horse) twin with a golden sword Chrysaor rose from the Gorgon's blood, and I only now realize that everybody stopped reading at the beginning of the story to figure out what the heck oceans and horses have to do with each other.  But Pegasus somehow worked it out, because his hooves would create springs when he touched the ground.

While I have to go through this, for anybody who might have continued reading, I should note that Medusa has had a bit of a revisionist popularity over the last century or so that resonates more than a bit with the project behind these blog posts.  We could, as readers of mythology, take the word of the myths as stated and treat Medusa as a dangerous monster to destroy.  But behind the "propaganda" of those stories, as I try to do in these posts, we might instead see a woman who largely opted out of society's rules, and got branded a "monster" for it, until some weirdo killed her based largely on rumor of her destructive nature.  And we should care about the difference, because at least a certain segment of the population (still) paints *feminists* with that same brush---I don't think that I've ever linked to the [anti-suffragette postcards](https://historyoffeminism.com/anti-suffragette-postcards-posters-cartoons/) on this blog that tell this story so well, depicting them as ugly, unloved, violent, and so forth---and we don't exactly have a shortage of [men who would happily take the role of Perseus](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/the-misogyny-fueling-americas-mass-shootings/) in the story.

 > **RIKER**: The Captain and I, along with seven others managed to get to the escape pod before the breach became critical.
 >
 > **PRESSMAN**: From space, we saw what appeared to be a matter-antimatter explosion which vaporized the ship.
 >
 > **RIKER**: No wreckage was found, so Starfleet officially declared the ship destroyed.

I'll gesture at this for an unrelated reason later, but I want to note now that, a lot like [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}), they tell a story about the *Pegasus* that makes no sense at all, even if we try to plug the later revelations into it.  If nine people made it to escape pods, then presumably the rest of the crew could have done the same.  And if they cut the escape *so* close that nobody else could reach a way out, then how did they survive the explosion?

And by the way, can they not tell the difference between sources of explosions?

 > **PRESSMAN**: The *Pegasus* was a prototype. Experimental engine, new weapon systems. In fact, some of our designs were used in constructing the *Enterprise*. There are a lot of things on board the Romulans would love to get their hands on.

Note the echo of [*Balance of Terror*]({% post_url 2020-04-16-trek-balance %}), suggesting that the Romulans somehow stole all their technology.

Also, though, in our world, try to imagine a group in this much of a lather, because some "enemy" might get their hands on...I don't know, pick literally anything from 2013.  They talk about weapons---maybe the only case where we can't talk about patents expiring after a while---and that seems like an especially weird place to care, since one imagine that they have researchers making new weapons all the time.

 > **RIKER**: Shields up. Red alert. Prepare phasers.
 >
 > **WORF**: Sir, they are hailing us.

Look how...*deflated* Picard and Riker look that they can't fight.

 > **PICARD**: Not at all. But your unannounced appearance might have unfortunate consequences. It would be an awful shame if your ship were damaged due to some misunderstanding.

Did Picard outright threaten someone who has shown no aggression?  Since I already mentioned the episode's similarity to *The Battle*, did younger-Picard treat the Ferengi the same way?

 > **PRESSMAN**: How long have you had that beard?
 >
 > **RIKER**: About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.

Apologies in advance, because I hate using these posts to comment on the physical appearances of people.  But did *anybody* think that Riker looked young in the first season?  Personally, I always thought that he looked like the stereotypical TV abusive boyfriend, but never *young*.

Also, the beard rolled out for the second season, so he has had that thing for at *least* five years.

Wait, did Riker maybe wear a fake beard for the second season...?  I will point out that, in [*Quality of Life*]({% post_url 2025-01-16-quality-life %}), he called his beard a "sign of strength"---and Crusher called him out on his vanity---suggesting that he might worry about how people perceive his strength.

 > **PRESSMAN**: Never. What happened was a tragedy, yes, but it wasn't your fault and it wasn't mine. What we were doing was for the good of the Federation, and we can't blame ourselves if the others couldn't see that.

This reinforces my idea that neither their cover story nor the story that we piece together from their admissions makes any sense.  If they thought that the ship got into some danger, and they escaped it, then they might obsess over ways that they might have saved everybody, but they wouldn't talk about direct blame.

They *would* talk about direct blame, if one of them actually did something that either caused the explosion or prevented the rest of the crew from following them.

 > **PRESSMAN**: It's not just me, Will. The Chief of Starfleet Security has personally given me her assurance of complete support.

I can't remember much about the series, and it almost certainly has nothing to offer this project, but I gather that the **Enterprise** finale, *These Are the Voyages...* happens during the run from now until Riker shows back up in the episode.

 > **PICARD**: I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was more concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission than with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of the marks of a good officer.

See, he *says* this, but then you have episodes like the other half of [*Gambit*]({% post_url 2025-06-26-gambit-part-2 %}), where Data insists that Picard doesn't accept any disagreement with his decisions...despite all the times the Riker has thrown fits and defied orders with no repercussions except the one time the other captain gave him a time-out in [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}).

We'll see how long the sentiment lasts...

 > **PRESSMAN**: Of course you are. I guess this mission has brought up some old ghosts for me. You know what it's like to lose a ship. You're always wondering if there was something else you should have done, something you missed.

And they directly reference *The Battle*, a weird choice given how closely an outside view on the two stories line up.

 > **RIKER**: I knew what I was supposed to do, and I didn't do it. If those had been real bat'leths I might be dead right now.

Introspection?  Last week, I joked that Worf didn't get back to the right universe because of Riker's reaction to mission preparation at the end of [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}).  This might bolster that theory...

 > **PICARD**: Mister Data, would it be possible to saturate the asteroid with verteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and prevent the Romulans from detecting it?

Also, the *Enterprise* sitting there zapping everything in sight might have looked a bit conspicuous, no?  Didn't they *head* this way because they noticed the sudden interest?

 > **PICARD**: Yes, there is. Judge Advocate General's Report. Stardate 36764. Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard USS *Pegasus*. Based on testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, the Judge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that certain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just prior to the destruction of the *Pegasus*. Mutiny on a Federation starship? That's shocking. It's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it.

I will remind readers that, in [*Lonely Among Us*]({% post_url 2022-06-30-lonely %}), Riker led a mutiny against a possessed Picard.  The previous crew mutinied against Kirk when possessed by Janice Lester in [*Turnabout Intruder*]({% post_url 2021-07-29-turnabout %}) and under the control of hypnotic aliens in [*The Lorelai Signal*]({% post_url 2021-09-09-lorelei %}).  And I can't rightly let this pass without reminding everybody about the time that Picard murdered a bunch of admirals, because he worried about foreign influence, in [*Conspiracy*]({% post_url 2022-11-03-conspiracy %}).  It doesn't seem nearly as unthinkable as Picard suggests.

 > **PICARD**: You know, it wasn't easy to get this record. I had to pull in quite a few favors at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seems that it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was the *Pegasus* carrying sensitive equipment which must be allowed to fall into Romulan hands, not only was there a mysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't, but it seems there was a mutiny on board. Now, I've read the official report of the inquiry on that mutiny, but I want to know your version of what happened.

I like how Picard casually talks about Starfleet's corruption.  He doesn't dig the cover-up, even though he probably did the same thing on the *Stargazer*, but he only doesn't like someone leaking classified files to him because he could've used those favors for something else illegal.

 > **RIKER**: I was seven months out of the Academy, my head still ringing with words like duty and honor. When they turned on him, I thought they were a bunch of self-serving, disloyal officers, so I grabbed a phaser and defended my captain. Two or three others joined us, but it was clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them. We felt a need to get off the ship. There was a running firefight all the way to the escape pod. About five minutes after we left the ship there was an explosion.

First, I didn't bother to quote the line about this all happening twelve years ago, but this fleshes out the timeline a bit.

And speaking of that time, it looks like---as hinted at by [*The Next Phase*]({% post_url 2024-10-24-next-phase %}), another interesting choice to connect this episode to, as we'll see later---Starfleet has a much faster promotion track than the current United States does, as codified in [DOPMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act).  In that episode, it suggested that Ro Laren would have gotten promoted at least a year faster than any real-world counterpart might.

This suggests that Riker *did* get promoted to Commander in less than half the time, that a real-world Commander would take, seven years out---those seven months out of the Academy until sometime before [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %})---versus fifteen to seventeen years by DOPMA rules.

Anyway, this also fills in the last of the relevant parts of the *Pegasus* story, and it still doesn't make any sense.  The big thing, which never really gets explained, happens.  The crew mutinies.  According to Riker, he defends Pressman, and they run for the nearest escape pod, shooting behind them to block pursuit...but the rest of the crew somehow diligently stays on their trail instead of letting them run.  They escape, the ship seems to explode, and they both blame themselves even if Pressman doesn't directly admit to it.

You see the two gaping holes, right?  First, it feels like a mutiny needs to get *really* bad before chasing the captain across every step of their escape route seems like a better idea than leaving them stranded in space where somebody else can pick them up; either they got so angry that they wanted vengeance, or they needed Pressman or something that he had and couldn't afford to let him go.  Second, unless one of them disabled or endangered the ship, none of this story explains why they worry about assigning blame for the deaths of the rest of the crew.

 > **PICARD**: The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officers are deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry. Further investigation is recommended. Will, there was no further investigation. This report was classified, and then it was quietly buried. Why?

Maybe because Pressman "pulled in some favors," or because they saw no reason to derail the careers of promising young officers, to name a couple of reasons for similar corrupt incidents that this show has had no problems with when it benefitted somebody who we see week to week.  I'll also accept that he asked the underlings to leave the room while he classified the file.

 > **PICARD**: Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force you to disobey his orders. Therefore, I will have to remain in the dark on this mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not let Pressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that that trust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the command structure of this ship. Dismissed.

Do you remember that speech that Picard gave about valuing the ability of a report to stand up to him?  Good for you, because it looks like Picard doesn't.  You should only stand up to Picard when *he* wants it, and in the form that he chooses...

I also like his whining about not having all the information in front of him, as if Starfleet always keeps him completely informed about every aspect of every mission.

 > **PICARD**: Mister Data, will you please note in the ship's log that this action is being taken over my explicit objections.

Does Picard always record his logs this way?  Does *everybody* shout their thoughts at Data and have him assemble them into coherent records?

 > **PICARD**: Yes, sir.

He *really* doesn't like following orders.  So much for wishing him a happy Captain Picard Day...

 > **RIKER**: I wonder how many of the crew are buried back there.

Twelve years later, grief finally starts to hit...

 > **PRESSMAN**: That treaty has bound our hands and given the Romulans a tactical advantage for the last sixty years. I was simply trying to level the playing field.

Have they done anything with that "tactical advantage"?  I feel like only Sela has presented anything resembling a threat, in episodes like [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}) and [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-07-04-unification-part-2 %}), and both of those felt like complete crackpot projects that required everything to work out perfectly for her and probably wouldn't have provided the Romulans with any actual benefit.  And it still looks like the Federation has them fenced into their home solar system.

It does go to show, however, how people view the Romulans, in yet another way.

 > **PRESSMAN**: We can't do it. If we abandon the Enterprise they'll come back here and get their hands on both ships.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Agreed. Options?

Funny how Picard suddenly turned around on the "can't let them get their hands on Federation equipment" issue.

 > **PICARD**: That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty of Algeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloaking technology.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as a Starfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it.

The heck you say...

I mean, Picard monologued "This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smooth relations between peoples. Not to act as a straitjacket," in [*The Ensigns of Command*]({% post_url 2023-05-11-ensigns-command %}).  And sure, he apparently got a bit better at how treaties work by the time of [*Suddenly Human*]({% post_url 2023-11-30-suddenly-human %}), but I can't *not* pick on him for the hypocrisy.

 > **RIKER**: It's more than just a cloak. It changes the structure of matter. In theory, a ship using this device could pass through normal matter.

Normally, I don't bother to quote the pseudo-science unless I can tie it to some other conversation.  In this case, I do it, because I want to suggest that this line eliminates the entire (alleged) Romulan threat, because *The Next Phase* already established that the Romulans had a device similar to this one in testing.  It does raise questions about whether the Federation stole the designs and got them implemented significantly faster, the Romulans stole the idea from the Federation, or both groups created it independently, but it no longer matters if the *Pegasus* falls into Romulan hands, because they already have the technology.

In fact, Sirol's presence only really makes sense if the Romulans already knew about the technology aboard the *Pegasus*.  We don't know (or probably care) if the specific motivation comes down to wanting to prove a treaty violation or getting a version of the technology that doesn't cause the ship grief, but either way makes far more sense than their spending this much effort on finding an obsolete ship because parts of it might remind them of the *Enterprise*.

 > **PRESSMAN**: Now that's enough. I'm taking command of this vessel. Mister Worf, escort the Captain to his quarters.

A mutiny?  On a Federation starship?  I wonder if it still seems unthinkable...

 > **PRESSMAN**: Can't you see the potential here? The phasing cloak could be the greatest breakthrough in weapons research in the last fifty years.

This line strikes me as interesting.  Because of how the characters portray the Romulans, and the Klingons to a lesser extent, it always feels like the opposition comes from their (alleged) "sneakiness," which the cloaking device exemplifies.  However, in the eyes of Pressman's team, this looks like a means to harm people.  And if this happened in another episode, we could potentially dismiss that difference of opinion as part of the militarist faction that Picard often sides with.

Here, though, Pressman works for their military intelligence organization, literally the sneaky stuff.  And he could have comfortably pitched this as a means to rescue operatives undetected or observe foreign actions that could turn hostile, and he probably would've gotten most of the crew and audience on board with that idea.  Sure, it violates the treaty, but in narrow cases that save lives...well, the *Enterprise* violates far more serious treaties than that almost every time they meet up with a rival power, and for far less legitimate reasons.  But no, Pressman calls it a weapon, meaning that Starfleet either wants a cloaking device on every ship for an advantage in military situations or the intelligence arm wants to attack targets with plausible deniability.

 > **DATA**: Theoretically it is possible, sir. But it would take several hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems.

What, do they have something better to do, where a few hours might turn them off to the plan?  This feels like some serious ChatGPT-level nonsense...

 > **PICARD**: They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone will know very shortly. Carry out my orders. Mister Worf, send a message to the war-bird. Inform them that their government will be contacted shortly about this incident.

It occurs to me that Pressman probably outplayed Picard, here, or maybe Picard doesn't really care about the outcome.  I mean, sure, the Federation government will call the Romulan government and admit...what, exactly?  That, twelve years ago, deep in their intelligence agency, an unknown number of "bad apples" briefly went rogue and developed an off-brand cloaking device, which they subsequently thought that they destroyed, but actually only lost?  And they have in custody exactly *one* member of that conspiracy, and could scrounge up eight people duped into helping him.

I almost said that "nothing will change," but Pressman's superiors now know that their design succeeded.  Unless Pressman plans to plead out give up the entire organization---and check the next quoted line for how well *that* particular theory might play out---then I see no version of this where the rogue elements (of unknown number and legitimacy) see the error of their ways and *don't* put their cloak into production somewhere.

 > **PRESSMAN**: I have a lot of friends at Starfleet Command, Captain.
 >
 > **PICARD**: You're going to need them.

I love it when they all admit openly to corruption in the fleet...

And by the way, how does Pressman's invocation of favors helping him skirt the law differ, exactly, from Picard's invocation of favors helping *him* skirt the law earlier to get his hands on the classified files?  The episode wants us to jeer at the former and accept the latter, but other than the fact that we see one of the two characters every week, that looks like exactly the same system.

 > **PICARD**: When the moment came to make a decision, you made the right one. You chose to tell the truth and face the consequences. So long as you can still do that, then you deserve to wear that uniform. And I will still be proud to have you as my First Officer.

Note Picard's subtle shift in emphasis, here.  In the overall story, Riker didn't have a "moment" to make his decision.  He had *twelve years*' worth of moments, and in all but one of them, he chose to protect his career.  Or at least, he protected his career in every moment *except* the one that Picard sees as mattering, when the other choice benefitted him.  Riker changed his allegiance from one father-figure to another, rather than had some moral breakthrough.

And honestly, you could take a fairly cynical view of his arc, where seeing Pressman dismiss aboard deaths on the *Pegasus* as the price of the experiment---again, *why* would he think this?---convinced Riker that the admiral probably wouldn't protect him if the secret got out, so he allied himself with someone who probably would, instead.

And because nothing matters in this universe, Riker will, in fact, face no consequences at all, from what we can tell.  We'll get to some of this as we coast into the new year, I'd imagine, but instead of "facing the consequences" of covering up a treaty violation including---reading between the lines of his argument with Pressman---at least leaving his crew to die while he escaped (and possibly taking action to prevent them from surviving), he will stay on as second in command of the "flagship," soon receive a promotion and become captain of the *Titan*, and seemed to have the clout of a retired admiral in **Picard**, though I don't believe that anybody calls him by the rank.

This recalls [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}), where the admiral seemed to have successfully prosecuted the cadets, then arbitrarily gave up because they wouldn't confess to covering up manslaughter.  And then when Wesley confesses, they give everybody except the "leader" a slap on the wrist before making them officers.

## Get Out the Tinfoil Hats, Kids

When covering early episodes in the series, I often found myself noticing and mentioning the strong New Age influence that this crew shows.  We have Troi, who generally functions as a flaky fortune-teller, most prominently, and why do people go to psychics at all if not for unlicensed therapy?  But we also had Wesley as the archetypal Indigo Child, the insistence that we should treat ancient legends as legitimate history, the various mind-over-matter plots, and the assorted government conspiracies.

That tapered off substantially, for a while, as the show restructured itself as more in the style of a daytime drama (American soap opera), where the presence of any science fiction elements exist primarily as a tool for one of the characters to work out the adolescent feelings that they haven't outgrown.  And now, as we near the home stretch of this series, the New Age influence has returned.

The quick reference, the one that most people at the time probably recognized, pointed to the so-called [Philadelphia Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Experiment), a conspiracy theory about the United States Navy trying to make the USS *Eldridge*[^1] invisible in 1943.  Depending on the retelling, this supposedly had bad side effects on the crew ranging from damaging the rational parts of their brain to destabilizing their atomic structure so that they passed through the ship's bulkheads and fused with them when the invisibility dropped.

[^1]:  Presumably selected as a homonym for [eldritch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eldritch).

Ignore the minor detail that the Navy didn't commission the *Eldridge* until a few months after this all took place, or make that inconsistency part of the conspiracy by imagining faked logs or another ship posing as the *Eldridge*.  Regardless, in the mid-1980s, Cinema Group adapted the story as a motion picture that brought the idea into the mainstream, as opposed to yet one more government conspiracy from the sorts of people who wouldn't shut up about Area 51 or vaccines used as a secret vector to microchip and track us[^2].

[^2]:  Apparently, *They* have tried to do this chips-in-vaccines thing to us for well over half a century---though I grew up with the version of "the Rockerfellers" behind it instead of Bill Gates who has so many worse things to answer for---leaving me with the conclusion that they have the worst organizational ability imaginable *or* don't actually exist.

By the time this episode had come out, the Philadelphia Experiment story had mostly run its course, but especially in my area, the [Montauk Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project) picked up as the "sequel"/replacement to the original.  In various versions of this story, including the one in a shockingly popular book by locals---as in, I had people in my life who worked with each of them---[Camp Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Hero_State_Park) took over the military's weirdest research, sort of a low-rent version of the [SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation).  They allegedly engaged in psychological warfare, the successor technologies to the Philadelphia experiment, [faking the Moon landings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories), exploring the [Martian pyramids and face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_%28Mars%29), dealt with alien governments, traveled through time and alternate dimensions, and more.

It comes too late for their obsessive 1980s vibe, but **Stranger Things** took (takes?) a lot of its setup from the Montauk Project, relocating it to the Midwest.  And you can usually find it mixed in with the Montauk area's ghost stories whenever somebody tries to document them in any usable format.  If you want context for the location, in shows set in New York City, wealthy people vacation in the Hamptons, right?  Montauk lies further east than the Hamptons---a cluster of beachfront towns all ending with the same suffix---along the same roads.  If you pass the lighthouse, then you've gone too far, which you'll probably realize because your car has started sinking into the Atlantic Ocean *and* you probably cheesed off some surfers.

## Conclusions

We get a surprising amount from this episode, even though it wants us to focus on the plot.

### The Good

The admiral makes it clear that events analogous to Captain Picard Day do not happen pervasively across the fleet, and most people would find it off-putting.

Starfleet appears to take at least one treaty seriously.

### The Bad

Picard tries to deny loving an event to celebrate his command that only he could have authorized, and quickly warms to the excuse that he serves as a role model.  He also claims to want officers who will stand up to him, but turns around quickly to yell at somebody who does.  He also rankles at needing to take orders from somebody else, and seems to consider Riker's morality only of relevance when it affects him directly.

We continue to see the same anti-Romulan paranoia.  They panic at the idea that Romulans might get their hands on twelve-year-old technology, and seem disappointed to need to talk instead of fight, even idly threatening the Romulan ship for no clear reason.  They insist that the Romulans don't actually invent things of their own, only steal the ideas from other cultures.  And many can't abide the thought that the Romulans might have an advantage in any situation.

The crew also seems to lack anything like situational awareness or theory of mind.  They seem to (twice) believe that the Romulan interest where they need to search has to do with some special insight into the search and not following their lead, and don't seem to realize that the "threat" only makes sense if the Romulans already know what to look for.

Picard still holds onto the fiction that mutinies never happen on Federation ships.

And we have plenty of corruption, in this episode.  Starfleet includes at least a faction of officers disregarding a major treaty.  Picard talks casually about how he pressured somebody to release classified files to him.  Pressman suggests that his friends will either help him in his trial or will harm Picard's career in retaliation.

The Federation appears to largely see cloaking devices as weapons of war.

Data continues to waste people's time, pointing out that their plan to survive might take a while and waiting for confirmation, rather than getting to work immediately to minimize that time.

### The Weird

Starfleet seems to promote officers far faster than similar organizations might in our world.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we meet Worf's other brother and return to the question of what the Prime Directive actually wants to accomplish, in *Homeward*.
