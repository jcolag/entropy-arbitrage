As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/110650290412778922) [The Supreme Court Has Killed Affirmative Action. Mediocre Whites Can Rest Easier.](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/supreme-court-killed-affirmative-action/) from The Nation

 > ...Thomas has decided to take his hurt feelings out on one of the most effective social justice policies in American history, while most Black people just learn to step over the low-account white folks clawing at our ankles.

Hashtags:  #SCOTUS #AffirmativeAction #ClarenceThomas

To this article, I can only think to include the origin of the phrase "affirmative action."  It comes directly from JFK's [Executive Order 10925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10925), where he required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that" the company didn't accidentally or deliberately discriminate against people from protected classes.  What does that mean?  It means taking concrete steps to find and remove bias from processes.

I always saw this as important, because it lays out the entire scam.  Like a lot of aspects of what I like to call *doze culture*, their objection to affirmative action revolves around people **seeing** the bias in the system, because if people see it, they'll want to fix it.

Can you do this without strong reference to the idea of race, a system that bigots created to impose those biases?  Not really, no.  You could try, but you'd end up with strange rules that dance around the term, like "has a physical appearance or relatives with same, which the average American may reflexively associate with a class of people previously kidnapped and bred as chattel," or similar.

You might want to also read [Supreme Court puts all anti-discrimination efforts in danger](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/6/30/2178379/-Supreme-Court-puts-all-anti-discrimination-efforts-in-danger) and I'll have a post on Sunday outlining my general thoughts on affirmative action.

I remember the rolling out of BMI as a universal metric, and everybody---except for the people whose opinions mattered---saw the obvious problems, as large percentages of people suddenly "became" obese, including basketball players...

While it doesn't affect the danger, as someone who remembers the days when people representing gender and sexual minorities risked shunning and violence if they expressed themselves.  We have gotten better, making this seem like a new problem, but it really shows that we never really fixed the old problem.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
