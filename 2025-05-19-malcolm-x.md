Today celebrates [Malcolm X Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X_Day), honoring the civil rights leader.  Given that most discussions of the 1960s United States Civil Rights Movement tend to downplay him for calling for sometimes-literal revolutionary change, the holiday hasn't seen wide adoption, but that never stopped me...

Anyway, let's check out the week's projects.

## Stenotype Corner

For my third week of actively trying to learn this, I started the week by consistently making it through the first [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) lesson, reaching a maximum of twenty-four words per minute with accuracy consistently above ninety percent or slightly below, a maximum of ninety-three percent.

Tuesday, as foreshadowed, I shifted to randomizing the words in the exercise.  Presumably, the software intends this, but *I* see it as ensuring that I actually grow accustomed to typing the words instead of the curated "was her has..." sequences and patterns.  And predictably, especially when this introduces new words that apparently sat beyond the length limits before, this set my progress back sharply, dropping below twenty words per minute and around eighty-seven percent accuracy, though bouncing back after a couple of days, one imagines more durably.

My speed hasn't *quite* gotten back to twenty-four words, but accuracy now hovers slightly above ninety percent again, with some favorable outliers[^1], which looks like progress to me.  The next lesson will make an appearance in the next day or two.

[^1]:  To pat myself on the back, yesterday's session included one run averaging twenty-four words per minute and a bit shy of ninety-eight percent accuracy, which I'd *definitely* call a "favorable outlier," at this stage.  The stored data also claims that I've memorized forty-two words, but I have no idea what that actually means, so I'll leave it in this footnote until I figure it out...

## Codidact

I've started thinking seriously about rehabilitating my old lecture notes into some modern form for distribution, so I couldn't help providing [an answer to What is the correct cost formula for the average case in insertion sort algorithm?](https://software.codidact.com/posts/293983/293984#answer-293984) when it came up.

## Mystic T-Square

{% github jcolag/mystic-t-square %}

Without some exciting insight, **Mystic T-Square** has probably gone about as far as it'll likely go.  This final batch of changes includes a final configuration option to change the AI's strategy, but also some minor cosmetic adjustments, such as blurring the game when somebody opens one of the modal dialog boxes, increasing the size of the emoji, and fixing the display of section dividers in those dialog boxes.

One word of warning?  Every strategy for the AI stinks.  That almost feels emblematic of 2025, doesn't it?

If I haven't described the process before, and assuming that not everybody has taken the computer science class where they explain how to do this where you'd already know, the AI takes the current board's state and looks into every possible future.  The algorithm looks something like the following decision-tree.

- If we can move { left, right, up, down }, how does moving in that direction change the board state?
- For every remaining empty box:
- What if they choose this box and get the trivia question right?  What if they get it wrong?
- If we still have empty spaces, do it again.

I could indent this for the programmers, but I don't think that makes it any clearer, considering that every line would only get indented further...

Anyway, no matter where we start every path leads to the AI winning (three no-gesture-emoji in a row), the player winning (three yes-gesture-emoji in a row), or a tie (no empty boxes remaining).  The forecasting adds up these wins, losses, and ties for each initial direction, providing data that looks something like this, though I inserted random numbers here.  When you set the look-ahead option to a small number, it stops the search early.

- up:
  + wins:  15870
  + losses:  7790
  + ties:  17570
- down:
  + wins:  1039
  + losses:  29615
  + ties:  9456
- left:
  + wins:  15046
  + losses:  11128
  + ties:  20568
- right:
  + wins:  27574
  + losses:  29727
  + ties:  24630

The AI code then sorts the directions based on the desired strategy, and chooses the best of the four.  Unfortunately, the numbers tend not to vary as much as that random example, hence this AI makes weirdly uninteresting choices in how to slide its tile.

## Ham Newsletter

{% github jcolag/ham-newsletter %}

Readers of [the newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) already have a pretty good sense of what needed to change, but as some quick background for everybody else, I stopped using [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) as my RSS feed reader, for a variety of reasons that I won't rehash here.  And because I don't necessarily envision the need to keep up with the news remotely anymore, and after a not-so-great experience working with Nextcloud's reader, [RSS Guard](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard) now serves as my RSS feed reader.

It lacks some features that I'd prefer, such as exposing the article tags for processing, or styling the article text, but it does the minimal job.  And marking articles as "important" saves them.

Changing RSS feed readers means changing how the aforementioned newsletter comes together.  When I looked at RSS Guard, I noted with some satisfaction that it stores its data in an SQLite database, meaning that the newsletter-generation can pull out those "important" articles with some SQL like this.

```SQL
SELECT
    m.title
  , m.url
  , f.title
FROM
  Messages m
INNER JOIN
  Feeds f
  ON
    m.feed = f.id
WHERE
    is_important = 1
  AND
    m.date_created > START_OF_MONTH
  AND
    m.date_created < END_OF_MONTH
ORDER BY
  m.date_created;
```

RSS Guard uses [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) for the dates, so that required some quick work to get the numbers, but I go through all this to finally mention that the repository now includes and uses a script to pull the month's saved articles from RSS Guard, replacing the prior script.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

This week *finally* gets around to refactoring the SASS code, most importantly.  Assuming that you ever check on the source code for all this, then you'll now notice that, rather than including information about all the link-annotation and language-annotation icons in the main `minima.scss` file, now (literally) includes one file for each icon font, instead.

```CSS
@include meta.load-css("minima/simpleicons");
@include meta.load-css("minima/fontawesome");
```

Doing this requires that the included *partial* files---and it took some research to discover this, so much that I put this off a few times after backing off the first attempt, and I emphasize the word "partial" because you won't find the relevant information otherwise---have names starting with an underscore character.

This will allow me to update (especially) the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) font whenever I need to without needing to hand-edit the code for each icon in use.  Eventually, that could even happen on a schedule, maybe checking weekly and updating the icons when the font updates.

Oh, I also added some readable names for emoji, including the aforementioned no-gesture {% emoji person gesturing no %}, a telephone receiver {% emoji telephone receiver %}, and the {% emoji cross mark %}.

## Next

I have some additional small changes for the blog, mostly behind the scenes, and a couple of possible new projects, but I otherwise don't know.  You'll see in Wednesday's post---calling my shot, here---that I do have one minor idea that probably wouldn't take long.  Alternatively, the time may have come to clear out the current backlog of library updates.
