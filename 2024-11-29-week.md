* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The Justice Department accused the company of selling software to landlords that collects nonpublic information from competing landlords and uses that combined information to make pricing recommendations.

If only we had an incoming administration that might continue opposing exploiting us...

 > You do not want unity among the tribes, and you destroy it. You try to make differences between them. We, their leaders, wish them to unite and consider their land the common property of all, but you try to keep them from this.

 > Western countries perpetuate this colonial legacy by proudly displaying the very stolen artifacts that serve as evidence of their colonial crimes. Even as much as 90% of Sub-Saharan Africa's objects are held outside of Africa.

It does still amaze me that museums almost unilaterally ignore the legacy of colonialism in alleged service of education...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113550333961958699)

 > Among the beasts were many hideous, nameless monsters, as well as dragons, lions, tigers, wolves, foxes, beavers, rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and all manner of creeping things such as lizards and serpents. Mankind could not prosper under such conditions, for the beasts and serpents destroyed all human offspring. All creatures had the power of speech and were gifted with reason.

 > Advocates say that women often fall into the system when trying to meet their basic needs --- such as participating in acts of robbery, sex or drug trafficking, property crimes, or being in an abusive relationship --- that might lead them to defend their lives or be charged as an accomplice.

I wish them luck, because we need more of this across the country.

These services reduce the risk of infections like HIV and hepatitis while encouraging people to seek help without fear of legal consequences.

 > Don't worry, though. Johnson did announce on Wednesday that he will make sure only women assigned female at birth can use women's restrooms on Capitol Hill---a policy that can seemingly be enforced only by forcing people to show their genitalia or submit to a blood test.

Hashtags:  #USPol #GOP #FamilyValues

When Republicans claim to speak for family values, we really need to start asking them to describe those values, because too many people seem to not realize that they mean "women make babies and do housework."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw Policing %}

 > For example, the police could better protect sex workers against violent criminals if sex workers trusted them. But when they increase enforcement against sex workers in response to demands from ‚Äòthe community', they erode sex workers' trust. They can't have it both ways.

Funny how you could write almost exactly the same article for almost any group other than white people who have become wealthy at white-collar jobs...

 > Stract supports advanced ranking customization by allowing users to import ‚Äúoptics‚Äù files, like a better version of Brave's ‚Äúgoggles‚Äù feature.

I get the impression that more than a couple of readers---assuming that these posts actually *have* more than a couple of readers, I mean---might want an overview of independent search engines.

It seems like we could write this article about almost every continent, but it still warrants saying.

 > Loops ships with limited tools for finding people and content at the moment. The Discovery tab features a profile carousel for accounts that the app thinks you might be interested in, with an easy way to pop into profiles and see what they have to offer.

I love seeing the Fediverse expand like this into new spaces, and hope that it succeeds, despite the recent surge of Bluesky usage.
