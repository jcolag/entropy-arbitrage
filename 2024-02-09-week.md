As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

A scholar of modern Jewish history explains](https://theconversation.com/when-is-criticism-of-israel-antisemitic-a-scholar-of-modern-jewish-history-explains-220995) from The Conversation

 > if Jews or Jewish institutions are held responsible for Israeli actions or are expected to take a stand one way or another regarding them, again all three definitions agree this ‚Äúcrosses the line‚Äù because it is based on the myth of a global Jewish conspiracy.

Hashtags:  #Israel #Gaza #Antisemitism

I always try to tread especially carefully, here, because I've had the privilege of knowing quite a few wonderful people who either came from or moved to Israel, and don't want to try to emulate their own criticisms of their government, while also making sure that I don't indirectly make their lives worse.  This article feels simplistic, to me, but I'd rather talk about something bare-bones than not have the discussion at all.

 > If we accept and acquiesce in the face of discrimination, we accept the responsibility ourselves and allow those responsible to salve their conscience by believing that they have our acceptance and concurrence. We should, therefore, protest openly everything... that smacks of discrimination or slander.

I look forward to seeing this research put into action.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/111885617904129663)

 > It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others... One ever feels his twoness,‚Äîan American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.

While I don't expect this to end in another Civil War, because the people behind these acts don't seem to have any actual spine in them, let alone fight, they certainly want their fans to *see* them as trying to start a Civil War, and they have four Supreme Court Justices cheering them on.

 > Trump also can't seem to distinguish between the many women he despises, like they've all melded together in his thick brain.

Hashtags:  #USPol #GOP #Haley #Trump

I wonder what Haley has in mind for her endgame, here.  She has to know that she can't win anything in this campaign.  At one point, it looked like her goal was to test the theory that you "become white" in the United States by dumping on Black people, but that only ever blows up in the face of individuals.  But the longer she stays in the primaries, the more Trump and the RNC need to spend to beat her, and the less coherent he looks.

Don't get me wrong, here.  I *doubt* that she has the country's best interests at heart, but if she manages to tank an increasingly fascist party, I'll at least say something nice about her on occasion...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/111896934493110376)

 > The present attitude on the part of white women to ignore or undervalue the colored woman, or to accept Negro women who are picked by Tom, Dick or Harry, forebodes evil and ill for both groups.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > She said the loan was ‚Äúa good starting point‚Äù on the anniversary of the looting and ‚Äúa sign of some kind of healing and commemoration for the violence that happened.‚Äù According to a report by the Conversation, the looting happened in Kumasi during the third and fourth Anglo-Ashanti wars (1873‚Äì74 and 1895-96). This plundering was not only an opportunistic act but also had a political purpose, aiming to humiliate the inhabitants of the Asante kingdom, as highlighted by both the BBC and the Conversation.

Seriously, as much as I loved looking at them growing up, I feel like permanent museum collections from other cultures should represent a source of massive embarrassment, at this point in history.

 > Not to put too fine a point on it, but these kinds of actions smack of the nullification of federal law that southern politicians employed in the years preceding the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865. To make matters worse, the Republican governors of 25 other states, including Indiana...have signed a statement in support of Texas‚Äôs actions that accuses the Biden administration of ‚Äúattacking‚Äù Texas and invokes the notion of state sovereignty that southern states used as a ‚Äújustification‚Äù for secession when they formed the Confederate States of America.
