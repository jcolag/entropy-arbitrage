As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:04 -- Mon 04 November 2024

Apparently, Monday's posts didn't schedule properly, but I *meant* to get this out.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [If the Census Bureau truly values accuracy, it should count incarcerated people at home](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2024/10/30/group_quarters_errors/) from Prison Policy Initiative

 > In Wyoming County, N.Y., rather than counting them in the facility where they were confined, the Bureau counted nearly a thousand incarcerated people in a field, and another group of over 800 was reported just across the street from their facilityâ€™s location â€” also in empty fields.

Yes, either we count inmates at their home addresses *or* we let them vote where we've incarcerated them.  Otherwise, we get literally the wrong extreme of the [three-fifths compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise), of a captured population that counts for political representation but doesn't have any representation of its own.

Good.  When I changed banks (to a local credit union), it didn't cost me anything, but I also didn't have anything other than money to transfer.  But I know that other people have a much more difficult time of it.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113431427037668543)

 > If our social arrangements were so adjusted that each person could follow that calling in life which they are by nature adapted for, what a great gainer society as a whole would be. These few who are so fortunate as to be able to follow the calling of their heartâ€™s desire make a success of life.

I hope that this starts the process, rather than ending it, but it still makes an excellent first step.

For the sake of having said it, mathematically speaking, nobody becomes a billionaire without widespread exploitation.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
