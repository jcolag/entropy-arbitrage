* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > When Americans insist that “it can’t happen here,” they exempt themselves from vigilance. When they ignore or discount extremism, seeing it as “weird” or “foreign,” they miss how effectively such movements borrowed American idioms, such as patriotism, Christianity and law and order, to further hatred, violence and exclusion.

I imagine that everybody reading here already knows some part of this story, but it still sometimes seems worth having the full story collected somewhere, and seeing how much work has gone into suppressing that bit of history.

 > That the scientific community looks a lot less like the country it serves is more than symbolic, the authors argue. Indeed, it influences how different groups of people trust scientists and scientific institutions, and how likely recommendations of scientists are to become public policy.

 > Because Americans often looked down upon agricultural workers as uncultured and illiterate – “little brown monkeys” was a common slur – Filipinos resisted these negative characterizations by presenting themselves like the Hollywood movie stars they saw at the cinema.

 > Not only has the Education Department failed to enter into any resolution agreements in those racial harassment cases, but it also has not initiated investigations of most new complaints. Since Jan. 20, it has opened only 14 [of 500+] investigations into allegations of racial harassment of Black students.

I remember that, when Trump first started campaigning, the worst people I know started talking about how white people no longer felt like they couldn't speak their minds.  Presumably, I didn't count as white for those purposes, because they didn't like it at all when I pointed out that I only ever felt that way when I didn't want to embarrass myself with ideas that I knew didn't hold water.

I miss the days when hurting people involved some amount of regret to maybe *avoid* the next time that the opportunity arises...

 >  We do not listen with the best regard to the verses of a man who is only a poet, nor to his problems if he is only an algebraist; but if a man is at once acquainted with the geometric foundation of things and with their festal splendor, his poetry is exact and his arithmetic musical.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Democratic Governance Depends on Stable, Affordable Housing](https://jacobin.com/2025/12/housing-democracy-isolation-tyranny-affordability/) from Jacobin

 > The crisis of affordable housing has severed the ties that the country’s founders thought necessary for democratic governance. When people become rootless, they are more atomized, unable to fulfill social roles in communities.

While this strikes me as uncomfortably close to aristocratic notions suggesting that only people who have invested significant money into a community (or inherited their property) should have opinions on their community, but if it gets people to stop thinking about land as an "investment opportunity" and more like a resource that people need to live, I can compromise...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Holiday shoppers are flexing political power through big boycott campaigns ](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/12/holiday-boycott-campaigns/) from Waging Nonviolence

 > During the long weekend of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the bonanza shopping days after Thanksgiving, Until Freedom worked with a coalition of more than 300 social justice organizations to boycott corporations that have rolled back DEI policies or supported federal immigration raids. In addition to Target, that campaign, called “We Ain’t Buying It,” took aim at Home Depot — which advocates say [has been complicit in the kidnappings](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/31/why-is-ice-targeting-so-many-home-depots-advocates-say-store-is-failing-to-protect-day-laborers/) of day laborers by federal immigration agents — and Amazon, which has funded Trump and his administration [through donations](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/13/amazon-donation-trump-inauguration) and [discounted government contracts](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/07/amazon-trump-admin-1-billion-coupon-00497009) (including with [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/wp-content/uploads/How-Amazon-Powers-ICEs-Deportation-Machine.pdf)).

 > In particular, the people of Brittany have long told tales of the lost city of Ys, a sunken settlement thought to be located in the Bay of Douarnenez, about six miles east of Sein Island. The sunken megaliths off Sein Island “allow us to question the origin of the history of the city of Ys, not from the historical legends and their numerous additions, but from scientific findings that may be at the origin of this legend,” the team said.

I should probably note that you might not have heard of Ys, because the legend...doesn't really fly for modern audiences.  In short, the beloved king established the city, only for his diabolical or dim-witted daughter to wreck it.
