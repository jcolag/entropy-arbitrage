## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## All Good Things..., Part 1

Since last time we met, over on **Deep Space Nine**, Kira investigates a worrying conspiracy theory in *The Collaborator*.

Oh, as for the title, I know that we all want to go with our gut instincts and assume that they clung to Shakespeare until the end, but best I can tell, people trace this to one of Will's inspirations, Geoffrey Chaucer's [**Troilus and Criseyde**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde).  Talking about the lovers (line #615) and their great time together, "*But at the laste, as every thing hath ende, / She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende*."  Or "but at last, as everything must end, she took her leave, as necessity would (have her) depart" in more modern English.

 > **TROI**: Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika music in the air, ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moon rising, and the most you can say is stimulating?

You might notice that she has chosen to get angry about the word-choice of a person who speaks English as a second language.  And she has also known him for seven years, now, so how he describes things should come as no surprise.  She also has that whole psychic empathy thing---you could argue that it constitutes her entire personality---so she also shouldn't need specific words to convey emotional meaning.

 > **WORF**: It was...*very* stimulating. What?

As usual, this has nothing to do with the post as such, but studios really missed out not centering Dorn in a sitcom somewhere.

 > **TROI**: You know, I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. I should take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time I'll choose the program. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love Lake Cataria on Betazed.

She acknowledges that most of her therapy involves shilling for the holodeck, and regrets not wasting enough of her own time there over the years.

Also, notice that she still hasn't given any indication of how she wanted the virtual reality described.

And by the way, this also has serious "fun facts about trains" vibes from [*Emergence*]({% post_url 2025-10-30-emergence %}).  His adoptive family at least has Russian roots, so he might only have a fondness for the Black Sea because of shared experiences, not because he digs big meromictic mediterraneans...

 > **TROI**: Worf, I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings, yours and mine.

Ah, I see.  Once she goes off the clock, *then* she can give healthy advice...

 > **PICARD** Counselor! What's today's date? The date!
 >
 > **WORF**: Stardate 47988.

He hasn't missed it.  The spirits have done it all in one night.  They can do anything they like.  Of course they can...

...Sorry.

Actually, given the structure of the episode(s) and the "end of the year (television season)" framing, I suppose that I can't guarantee that I won't need to go back to the Charles Dickens[^aZyBAT] well a few more times, but I don't *think* that I will.

[^aZyBAT]:  To my deep embarrassment, I don't think that I made the connection until now that this probably would have aired between the Drama Desk nomination and award for Outstanding One-Person Show, for Patrick Stewart's adaptation of [**A Christmas Carol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol_%281988_play%29).  In other words, they may not have chosen the "self-absorbed man visits the past, present, and future, learning that maybe he should try to care about people" story haphazardly, instead not-so-subtly campaigning for their favorite stage performer.

Also, an authoritarian leader with hair-related insecurities has cognitive problems.  Whoever would've guessed that part feeling relevant...?

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain Picard to the Bridge! Captain, we've got a problem with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing.

It doesn't improve the experience of the show nearly as much as the writers think it does for them to tell us that they know how the scripts sound but still do it anyway.  They'll pull this a couple more times before we close this out, too, feeling more like they've decided to taunt us for wasting well over a hundred hours[^FNUCjn] on them...

[^FNUCjn]:  The show has 178 episodes, running an average of forty-five minutes, for a total run-time of 133 hours, thirty minutes (a bit more than five-and-a-half days), plus any deleted scenes that you scrounge up.

Also, decades after Pulaski told La Forge that Starfleet pretty much lied to him, and that they actually could grow him replacement eyes in [*Loud As a Whisper*]({% post_url 2022-12-22-loud-as-whisper %}), he still wears a prosthesis.

 > **LAFORGE**: You've got leaf miners. You might want to use a bacillus spray. My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it.

I didn't expect this episode to teach me anything, but many strains of [Bacillus thuringiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis) (Bt) produce a natural insecticide, something that we don't think about in our world because you can find it almost anywhere that you'd expect to find insects, plus weirder places such as the digestive tracts of moths and caterpillars.  Given what we've seen before, in episodes such as [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}) and its crackpot "raise the ocean floor" scheme, I wonder if this signals that Earth has wiped out the natural bacteria in soil and plants.

Oh, and [leaf-miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_miner) exist, too.  The larval forms of various insects burrow into leaves to live and feed, usually without damaging the outer layers of the leaf.  Their trails strike me as too conspicuous for nobody to have noticed the infestation until the bionic eyeballs showed up, but I don't know how lazily Picard runs his business.

 > **PICARD**: How is Leah?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Just wonderful. Busy as ever. She's just been made director of the Daystrom Institute.

The fact that any possible future in this fictional universe exists where La Forge marries the woman with whom he pretended to carry out an entire romantic relationship on the holodeck in [*Galaxy's Child*]({% post_url 2024-02-22-galaxy-s-child %}) and somehow made it *her* fault when she found it objectionable might worry me about the franchise more than pretty much anything else that they've mentioned.

And sure, they only provide a given name, so *technically* he could have married anybody named Leah.  However, (a) how often do we really have name-collisions on this show, and (b) what about him marrying somebody with the same uncommon name as somebody who he invested time and energy (and Starfleet resources) into pretending to have sex with seems any less creepy to you?

 > **PICARD**: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and err...?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Sidney.

In the third season of **Picard**, which tried implausibly hard to pose as the thirty-fifth season of this show, we meet Sidney and Alandra.

I'll point out a couple of similar plot points that the show grabs, because even though I don't know if these posts will expand to any "third generation" shows[^dGNf08] like the project grew past my original intent to stop at the end of what could have gone into **Phase II**, the connections recycled later suggest that we should take what we see in this future more literally than we did for the projections in an episode such as [*Future Imperfect*]({% post_url 2023-12-28-future-imperfect %}), which I don't believe the franchise has reused at all.

[^dGNf08]:  If we get there at all---and keep in mind that we have at least seven years before that decision could *possibly* matter, assuming that I and/or the Internet even last that long---and duck behind the paywall, I'd expect to only deal with the shows that extend this or the original setting forward, **Lower Decks**, **Prodigy**, and **Picard** in that order, and maybe **Section 31**, though I don't remember it spending much energy on the Federation.  Much as I enjoyed **Discovery**, it inspired these posts to debunk the criticism that every *Star Trek* needs to establish a paradise worth defending, which feels like it necessarily excludes the first half of the series from the concept here, and the second half drops them so far in the future that comparisons with other eras seem meaningless (think of trying to line up the global restructuring in the face of Genghis Khan's military campaigns with today's international alliances and economic communities), which will presumably also echo in **Starfleet Academy**, whenever that comes out.  And **Strange New Worlds**...I know that it has its ardent fans, but to me, it feels ashamed of the original series and desperate to rewrite it as a modernized **Next Generation** where you can *do* social satire, but only if you carefully both-sides the issue and make it clear that the crew has no actual duties in their colonial expansion except to mimic a patriarchal family.  Only time will tell, though.  In 2033, maybe enough time will have passed that revisiting these third-generation shows will interest me, and if so, in 2035, maybe the shows that I've excluded from them...

 > **PICARD**: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just to drop by.

You know how this goes, by now, right?  [Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel) has gotten *many* mentions since [*Mudd's Women*]({% post_url 2020-02-20-trek-m-women %}), and sits about eight hundred fifty light years from Earth.  I'll let you decide whether that makes "dropping by" more or less likely, four hundred years or so into the future...

 > **PICARD**: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its course.

As with La Forge's children, **Picard** also picks the story of Picard's completely fictional illness right back up, for some reason.

Also, if I had to pick a defining character trait for Picard, I'd have to go with his obnoxious obsession with using ableist terminology whenever an opportunity presents itself.  He'll do it a **lot**, as we slog through this.  I apologize for allowing it to propagate through these posts.

 > **PICARD**: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah's standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read your last novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, but for the rest I---

Apparently, people still (or maybe again) read and write novels.

Also, since this show has gone so far out of its way to even avoid touching on metaphors and innuendo---except in [*The Dauphin*]({% post_url 2023-01-26-dauphin %}) and [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}), both of which make it clear that they absolutely don't approve---it only seems appropriate to assume that, by "flamboyant," Picard means gay.

 > **PICARD**: No. It's just that you look very familiar.

Well, yeah, dress her in a blocky sweater and a bowl-cut, and she looks exactly like the crackpot who tried to invade Vulcan with a deepfake Spock and a comically tiny occupational force.  Or, in terms of 1930s references that Picard might find more familiar, she looks a bit like [Bing Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby), too...

 > **YAR**: Acknowledged, Enterprise. And there she is.

I feel like a gutsier show would've held this for six minutes, parodying the equivalent scene in [**The Motion Picture**]({% post_url 2022-03-10-tmp %}), daring the fans who complained about it then to say anything unkind about Picard...

 > **PICARD**: Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare feet.

This line probably made me laugh when the episode first aired, but I've since worked in more than one office where the boss walked around without their shoes...and had a problem with other people doing the same, so I now assume that Picard didn't say this with any trace of humor.

 > **PICARD**: I wasn't dreaming. Something happened.

You know, for somebody who clings to that silly flute to remind himself of that one time that he lived out an entire life as an alien scientist in a hallucination---in [*The Inner Light*]({% post_url 2024-10-31-inner-light %}), I mean---it actually bothers me a bit that he seems so focused on proving that he physically left the ship.

That said, especially since part of this scene revolves around trying to get Crusher to find proof for him, maybe he realizes that people might treat him like he does her.  I don't think that the episode *intends* such a thing, understand, but it would feel extremely appropriate to use the finale of this series to echo [*Turnabout Intruder*]({% post_url 2021-07-29-turnabout %}), which under its hammy acting and poor writing did seem to want to make the captain's problem the disbelief of what women say.

 > **NAKAMURA**: Captain.

We last saw Nakamura in [*Phantasms*]({% post_url 2025-07-03-phantasms %}), and I explained the likely relevance of casting [Clyde Kusatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Kusatsu) then.

 > **NAKAMURA**: Our operatives on Romulus have indicated that there appears to be something happening in the Neutral Zone, specifically in the Devron System. Our own long range scans have picked up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area. We can't tell what it is.

I can't believe the absolute gall of such a blatantly aggressive move as *something happening*.

We've seen, in episodes such as [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %}), that Starfleet doesn't believe that the Romulans have the right to patrol their borders, so this panic certainly doesn't come out of nowhere.  [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}) later suggested that this philosophy applies to all powers that Starfleet doesn't like.  The Federation, and only the Federation, can apparently send ships to its borders.

Oh, also, they have spies monitoring rival powers.

 > **PICARD**: Am I authorized to enter the Neutral Zone?

The situation seems tense, Picard surmises, and so he wants to know when he can violate international treaties to make everything far worse, I guess...

 > **PICARD**: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the *Enterprise*. At least, I think that's where it was. I was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital.

Again, terms like "senile" cause all sorts of problems.  The term itself derives from the Latin *senex* for "old man," used because people imagined deterioration of the brain to occur as an ordinary part of aging.  We now mostly call it [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia), though.  But as mentioned, Picard does have a long tradition of using ableist terminology.

 > **PICARD**: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not that. And I'm not daydreaming either.

And Picard already has more crude things to say about people living with psychiatric illness, this time in the most defensive way possible.

 > **PICARD**: They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing?

Well, for one possibility, the fact that he keeps insulting people with disabilities certainly makes him worthy of ridicule...

 > **PICARD**: I know how it sounds, but it happened. It was real. I was there, back on board the *Enterprise*.

We see a goofy hovering car zip by, immediately before this line, I believe the first (non-twentieth century) land vehicle that we've seen in the franchise.

 > **PICARD**: Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.
 >
 > **JESSEL**: Course it's hot. What do you want in it?

You know that I've talked a lot about how the *Enterprise* often seems to make it clear that they have a specific person in mind who it serves, based on its ergonomics.  If you grew up somewhere significantly warmer or colder than springtime in the United States or Europe, if you stand too tall or too short, if you don't know English imperial units, or any of a number of other variations in what makes you comfortable affects you, then *you* need to adapt, rather than the computer that can allegedly do almost anything.

This exchange, having a laugh at Picard's usual drink order, indicates that the *Enterprise* computer also doesn't handle accents well.  In our world, you'll often find people with accents dealing with voice recognition as Picard does, juggling their word order so that they can deliver the entire request in careful terms that the system can't misinterpret as "otter creatine"[^_xYcbb] or something similarly horrible.

[^_xYcbb]:  As in *hot* (drop the /h/) run together with *Earl* (drop the /l/), then *Gray* (confuse the /g/ with a /k/, stretch the vowel) run together with *tea* (assume that the speaker dropped the final consonant).  We could probably do better with more rigorous work at fouling up the order, but I came up with "otter creatine" in the time constraints, so I have to roll with it...

 > **DATA**: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This house originally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It's become the traditional residence.

Data holds the post of the real-world [Lucasian Professor of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics), for...*reasons*, I guess.

 > **DATA**: Jessel. She can be frightfully trying at times, but she does make me laugh.

...Jackass.

Also, note the inherent inequality present on Earth that Data employs a *servant*.  He doesn't do the work himself.  He doesn't have technology serving the purpose.  No, he has a working-class-coded woman who he resents for occasionally standing up to him.  And I realize that I have hammered on this for three years, but none of this reads like "material needs no longer exist," as Picard put it in [*The Neutral Zone*]({% post_url 2022-11-10-neutral-zone %}).  What about this gig "improves" Jessel, if not getting her closer to paying the mortgage?

 > **DATA**: I found that a touch of gray adds an air of distinction.

It does not, any more than the beard did in [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}).  But it shows that he still feels like he needs to fight for respect.

 > **PICARD**: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon.

Whoa, they might have actually used a generic drug, for once.  The suffix stems *-peridol* and *-peridone* refer to different types of antipsychotic drugs---such as haloperidol and risperidon, respectively, if you have familiarity with such things---and *-axine* refers to antianxiety and antidepressant drugs, so it doesn't take a huge leap to combine them to reach a *-peridaxon* suffix, and then use that compound suffix as a categorical name for something that treats both.

That might hint at the expected symptoms of the illness, beyond Picard's vague worries about losing his faculties.

We might also wonder what changed, here.  Does Starfleet exclusively use brand-name drugs because the replicators make it easier to license them, whereas veterans need to shell out for their prescriptions?  Or has the economy cratered, where even Picard needs to shop around?  Personally, I like the idea that his vineyard went out of business a decade ago, and La Forge actually picked him up as a migrant agricultural laborer...

 > **DATA**: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However, there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possible something is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run a complete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at the biometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to take over my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week. Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this.

Somebody should notify Cambridge that their extremely prestigious mathematics professor confuses absence of proof as (likely) proof of absence...

 > **PICARD**: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148. You are hereby requested and required to take command...to take command of the USS *Enterprise* as of this date. Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command. Red Alert! All crew to battle stations.

We met Satie in [*The Drumhead*]({% post_url 2024-03-28-drumhead %}), maybe ironic given Picard's concerns about his psychiatric state in this episode and how diligently he tried to make it look like Satie had lost control in the other...

 > Personal log, stardate 41153.7. Recorded under security lockout Omega three-two-seven. I have decided not to inform this crew of my experiences. If it's true that I've travelled to the past, I cannot risk giving them foreknowledge of what's to come.

Maybe more importantly, he seems incapable of describing the situation without sounding delusional and paranoid or linking it to his degenerative illness that would tend bolster that characterization, so they'd presumably throw him in the brig or sickbay and turn the ship around to get a new captain.

Also, though, why can he smuggle information from the future to his alleged present, but not from his present to his past?  I mean, I know that he doesn't because the episode needs "the scene" that we'll talk about next time, but that still doesn't explain the character's motivation unless he read the script.

 > **PICARD**: Noted. Counselor, do you sense anything unusual on board the *Enterprise*? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn't belong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own?

I stand corrected.  He also can't *not* tell the story without sounding delusional and paranoid.  This version involves more leading questions, though.

 > **YAR**: With all due respect, sir, I'm the Security Chief on this ship. Unless you're planning to make a change.

The writers want us to connect this sleight with our future-knowledge that Yar has died and Worf has taken her position, but let's also not forget that Picard went *way* out of his way in [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %}) to dismiss Yar as "a lovely female" who he only doesn't try to seduce because he'd like to keep his job[^4VOUCM].

[^4VOUCM]:  Yes, and he probably wanted to keep certain parts of his anatomy.

 > **WORF**: Captain, it could be a Romulan trick to lure our ships into the Neutral Zone as an excuse for a military strike.

They have to intend all this as satire, right?  I can't imagine any writer seriously writing a line like this and not expecting us to laugh or roll our eyes at it.  The Romulans, they believe, have decided to stand around *in their territory*, to trick Starfleet into violating their treaty, so that they can retaliate for the treaty violation.  Or in other words, the Federation knows that it has a reputation for provocation (and blaming others), and Worf not only agrees, but warns that Picard will do it if he thinks that he can get away with it.

 > **O'BRIEN**: Starfleet's cancelling our mission to Farpoint Station and ordering us to the Neutral Zone as soon as we leave the space-dock.

Time travel lets us borrow O'Brien from **DS9**...

Oh, and you don't need me to link to [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), at this point, do you...?

 > **PICARD**: No, we'll proceed to Farpoint.
 >
 > **YAR**: Sir?
 >
 > **PICARD**: You heard me.

In what timeline does this decision make *any* sense?  He wants to violate an order to a degree that it could reasonably spark a mutiny.  He knows that the Farpoint mission can wait, especially with a team on the ground.  And he should recognize the Romulans flocking to the Neutral Zone from seven years in the future, which you would think might spark his curiosity.  But no, I guess that he still wants to pretend to protect the timeline based on what somebody could interpret as a dream about the future.  And sure, you can claim that he sees Q's hand in this and wants to skip to that part of the pilot, but events in two similar events in the timeline seem like they point to finding Q in a different location.

 > **PICARD**: I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed with our mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right in thinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers.
 >
 > **O'BRIEN**: That's right, sir.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'll be in main Engineering. Mister O'Brien, will you use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer.

After seven years when Picard has shown absolutely no interest in technology, I refuse to believe that he somehow memorized the solution or actually has a deep understanding and never let on about it across dozens of episodes.

 > **O'BRIEN**: How did you know that, sir?
 >
 > **PICARD**: From your Starfleet records.

I believe this, because we have never seen Picard ask any member of the crew about their lives.  It doesn't make it any less creepy for Starfleet to record childhood hobbies and for Picard to have read through any of it, though.

Also, regardless, on the *Enterprise*, let's not forget that O'Brien rose up through the ranks to become...the guy who stands in the transporter room to flip the occasional switch.  Over on **DS9**, he became the chief engineer (and apparently lost his officer status), but we won't see him do any significant engineering for years after when this takes place.

Oh, and the actual hobby of building model ship engines probably derives from [*Booby Trap*]({% post_url 2023-06-08-booby-trap %}), where he validates Picard's interest in building ships in bottles as a child.  We could plausibly imagine that they bonded over that moment between episodes, but that doesn't seem like either character.

 > **DATA**: I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did it come to be used in contemporary language?

I would say that "I don't miss this nonsense," but I feel like we've had a bunch of asking questions that he could more easily look up for himself this season, so...

 > **RIKER**: And yet in both the past and the present there's a report of the same anomaly in the Devron System. I find it hard to believe that that's a coincidence.

Well, *I* find it hard to believe that it took them this far into the episode to bring it up, *and* that the writers gave the line to Riker of all people...

 > **RIKER**: Deanna, it's going to be a late night. Would you like to have some dinner first?

You realize that the creep hasn't actually had much interest in Troi's personal time for most of the series until his clone/brother invited her to run away (to another ship) with him in [*Second Chances*]({% post_url 2025-05-01-second-chances %}) and her budding relationship with Worf starting mostly in [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}).  It fits with his almost violent outbursts in episodes such as [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}), but that doesn't make it any more worth watching...

 > **RIKER**: I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine.

Imagine that, Riker having trouble paying attention, but blustering through anyway.  Have all his other lapses happened because a woman shot him down?

 > **CRUSHER**: Doctor's orders. You're exhausted. Look, I don't know whether you've slept in the past or in the future, but I'm sure you haven't slept in the present. Now get some rest, or I'll have you relieved and sedated.

We haven't seen this show drug somebody (or threaten to do it) for mild convenience in a long while...

 > **LAFORGE**: All right. Okay. But first, there is no Neutral Zone, remember?

OK, but it seems entirely reasonable for somebody to refer to the area by its former name, *especially* if the area doesn't have a current political significance.  For example, in the United States, it doesn't happen *much*, but you'll sometimes hear people refer to the territory east of the Mississippi River as the Colonies, referring to the territory (ignoring Florida) composing the thirteen colonies that became the country's original states.  You'll also still occasionally find references to the [Iron Curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain), now referring to the line down eastern Poland-to-Albania borders rather than ideologies, though you'll increasingly see references to the [Green Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Belt) starting to replace it.

In the grand scheme, this probably doesn't rank high on the list of issues, but it does hint at something contentious around dismantling of the Neutral Zone that they worry about calling the area by its old name.

 > **RIKER**: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, but frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed their borders to all Federation starships.

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you took an officer who never prepares for any mission but always has time for sexual harassment, and promoted him to a position with a reputation for doing nothing but engaging in corruption?  I present you with Admiral Riker...

 > **RIKER**: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence this morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual going on in the Devron system.

Why would Starfleet Intelligence check for spacetime weirdness?

 > **CRUSHER**: Yes. Jean-Luc, crossing into Klingon territory. It's absurd. But then I never could say no to you.

 > **PICARD**: Oh. So that's why you married me.

Honestly, after seven (well, six) years of this, it wouldn't actually surprise me if Picard bullied or gaslit Crusher into marrying him.  "Have you considered that you only dreamed that this seems like a terrible relationship?  You really should learn to put your feelings aside when you respond to my proposal."

 > **PICARD**: So, you kept the name.

Lending credence to the idea that Picard somehow manipulated his way into marriage, Crusher---a woman who routinely calls out sexism, publishes research papers that peers and non-doctors find interesting, and has led Starfleet's entire medical division, if only for a year---has changed her name *twice* to serve as an adjunct to her husbands' families.

 > **PICARD**: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not want to be patronized.

I don't know.  In my experience, when senior citizens (or anybody else) start ranting about how we shouldn't treat them like *those* folks with disabilities, identified with yet another slur from the ambassador, leading them around and patronizing them seems entirely warranted.

 > **CRUSHER**: You're right. I'm sorry.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Now, I'll go and get some rest.

I have to admit that it looks a lot like Picard only held out on resting to reprimand Crusher yet again.

 > **CRUSHER**: Do you really think he's moving through time? I'm not sure I do either. But he's Jean-Luc Picard and if he wants to go on one more mission, that's what we're going to do.

Normally, at this point, I would suggest something like imagining this scene playing out in our world, somewhere, to see how this reeks of corruption.  But this time, I can't even imagine this scene playing out in *fiction*, where serious people decide that they may as well misappropriate military resources to trigger an international incident, because they want to please their father-figure.

 > **WORF**: What is a Q?
 >
 > **YAR**: It's a letter of the alphabet, as far as I know.

Like I mentioned with Dorn at the top, with this kind of delivery for an objectively silly line, I don't understand why we haven't seen Crosby all over sitcoms.  And it also underscores how poorly they treated the Yar character in failing to give her lines like this quietly undermining the scene...

 > **PICARD**: I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room.

Well, he bailed on emergency orders to go play with the intelligent torture-city story, so I have to admit that it has the virtue of consistency for him to also decide to ignore the torture-city so that he can sit around waiting for the plot to come to him...

 > **PICARD**: Q. I knew it. What's going on?

Yeah, he definitely knew it...except for all the time that he spent blaming Romulans for everything, and sat around for who-knows-how-long in the wrong place doing nothing.

 > **PICARD**: We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent. You agreed, and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again?

As I recall, the pilot actually ended with Q (rightly) pointing out that Picard stumbled into the solution, then walked away in a huff, insisting that the trial hadn't ended.  And I would also point out, again, that when faced with literally the same problem, which he could have solved directly this time around, he couldn't even bother to call ahead to tell Riker to rescue the starving alien city, because I guess he already proved that he can engage in kindness, and so doesn't need to do so again...

 > **Q**: No and no. Five down.
 >
 > **PICARD**: That's only four.

Tell it to the lighting director, captain...

 > **PICARD**: We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted new species, we have expanded our understanding of the universe.

Have they, though...?  I mean, it especially sounds galling coming from Picard who keeps insisting that he has done all the growing that he would ever need to do, but also, even at the most direct, planets seem entirely countable, and he seems like the sort of proud colonialist who would even have that number in mind at all times.  They have met new cultures, and...it hasn't usually gone well.  And their understanding of the universe seems to usually involve developing weapons, especially since they seem to have abandoned the whole "warp drive rips up space, so we should take care" thing.

 > **PICARD**: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged.

You know, from the guy who goes out of his way to pass judgment on every culture that he encounters while (as mentioned) touting his own culture's wonderful perfection, his mewling "trying our best" nonsense rings more than a bit hollow...

 > **Q**: Oh, but it is, and we have. Time may be eternal, Captain, but our patience is not. It's time to put an end to your trek through the stars, make room for other more worthy species.

Do you get it?  He said the words in the title.  Laugh, because... {% emoji person shrugging %}

 > **Q**: You obtuse piece of flotsam. You are to be denied existence. Humanity's fate has been sealed. You will be destroyed.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act.

Didn't he meet somebody who erased an entire civilization from history in [*Survivors*]({% post_url 2023-05-18-survivors %}), though?  Maybe he doesn't find genocide as interesting when a dude named Kevin does it.

And we'll cut this post off at the end of this scene, when Riker calls for a red alert.

## Conclusions

We get our first surface vehicle in this episode, I believe, though the rest mostly seems to rehash some of the greatest hits.

### The Good

Troi, at least, seems to understand that Riker doesn't have any say in her relationship with Worf.

### The Bad

This episode features an unusual helping of racism.  Troi argues with a non-native English speaker about word choice when she presumably has other ways to determine his intent.  They also see the Romulans as a threat for having ships in their territory, and Picard wants to provoke them.

Related, Picard also uses a *lot* of demeaning,  ableist language, and nobody seems to have a problem with it.  And they give us some classism from Data, too.

Troi largely confirms that she doesn't do much in her role beyond suggesting that people play around in the holodeck, and thinks that she should slack off more often there, as well.

We also see fairly consistently that romantic relationships largely exist to gratify the man.  In cases where the men have a rivalry, they don't pursue the relationship.  And in the sexism vein, Picard also demands an apology for making him take care of himself.

The episode also indicates that Picard's way of ordering tea sounds as odd to people in their world as it does in ours, suggesting voice recognition problems with his accent.

Whether or not they actually do, people find it entirely credible for Starfleet to keep files on everybody's childhood hobbies.  Likewise, we see evidence of the Federation's reputation, in the idea that the Romulans might provoke an attack by showing up somewhere near their borders.

We have gone back to seeing carelessness and a lack of focus among leaders, though they do pedantically argue what to call regions of space.  They have also returned to freely drugging people to get them out of the way.  And they see no serious issues with using military resources to follow a famous civilian's delusions, possibly provoking a foreign government along the way.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we close out the series with (to nobody's surprise) the second half of *All Good Things...*
