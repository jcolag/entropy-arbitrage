## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Realm of Fear

To those celebrating or have celebrated, and (as always) acknowledging the [holiday's problematic history](https://daily.jstor.org/thanksgiving-has-been-reinvented-many-times/), I'd like to wish you all a happy {% emoji fowl %} Thanksgiving.  Somehow becoming a tradition---probably more due to the median quality of episodes than timing---we may need to struggle a bit to give thanks for this episode...

Anyway, we'll probably skip through a lot of this, since most of it falls under my "dramatic reading of the technical manual" heading in the guise of a character study, but you never know.  This *could* have more to offer than a whopping three recurring characters...

 > **BARCLAY**: Why? Because my career in Starfleet would be over, that's why.

The episode centers on a distrust of the transporters, but this line feels like it stands out.  Whether or not they would *actually* discharge an officer for having a fear of the transporter, the fact that any officer could believe that it'd happen seems damning in its suggestion that people don't want to show any vulnerability.

 > **BARCLAY**: No, no. We talked about confronting my fears. The best way out is through. You said that once, remember?
 >
 > **TROI**: I suppose I did.

You know, I *almost* said something positive about the representation of therapy, here.  Troi talks about desensitizing him to a fear of something central to his life, starting with relaxation, which I might not agree with in total, but at least makes some sense and sounds professional.  Then we find out that she mostly churns out random aphorisms...

 > **BARCLAY**: You're afraid of transporting, too?
 >
 > **O'BRIEN**: No. Arachnids. Sickening, crawly little things, don't you think? All those legs.

I realize that small sample sizes lead to strange conclusions, but two out of nine characters in this episode having crippling fears seems maybe worth noting...

 > **HAYES**: Although I'm loath to believe the Ferengi about anything, there was evidence of Cardassian weapons. If the Cardassians also attacked the *Yosemite*, it could indicate a large scale movement into this sector.

Yes, it would feel so utterly *terrible*, if anyone needed to accept Ferengi as actual people capable of cooperating and telling the truth... {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **O'BRIEN**: You see, sir? That wasn't so bad, was it.

If a dematerialized person can have experiences during transport---instead of vague feelings like we heard about in [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %})---does that mean that they've established consciousness as something physical and separate from the body?

 > **LAFORGE**: Reg, how many transporter accidents have there been in the last ten years? Two? Three? There are millions of people who transport safely every day without a problem.

I don't know if this tells us anything useful.  The United States military has about one-and-a-third million active-duty members and about eight hundred thousand reservists, for a little over two million members, putting us somewhere near the tenth-largest military[^1].  Many countries also have paramilitary forces.  In total, it looks like seventeen countries have militaries with a million or more members.  Because of those numbers, this doesn't tell us whether---for example---civilians use transporters to commute.

[^1]:  That statistic came as a complete shock to me, when people (rightly) remind us that we spend nearly a trillion dollars on the military, more than the next bunch of countries combined.

 > **DATA**: Perhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions.

Everybody died when the other ship did that, based on their analysis, but sure, give it a try "to see what happens."  Maybe the afterlife hands out academic awards, I don't know...

I mean, it'll *work*, but I find it hard to believe that the other team didn't think to put a force field up when working with plasma, so their experiment should've ended in the same way.

 > **LAFORGE**: Counselor, do you have a minute?

Data passed Barclay's problems on to La Forge, who passed them on to Troi.  It feels like anybody could have sat him down to talk, *or* they could've had the rest of this episode consisting of each character resignedly calling someone else to have them deal with Barclay...

 > **TROI**: Mister Barclay, you're exhausted and highly agitated, and I cannot allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others. I think---

In case you thought that this line came from some key insight, let me remind you that Barclay told *her* that he couldn't sleep and "always" seemed nervous.

 > **COMPUTER**: Specify temperature.

I believe that I've asked this before, but *why* would the computer ask that?  Surely, if the person doesn't specify and hasn't given a default, then they want the water at the current room temperature.  And most people don't think to drink water until after dehydration sets in, so this question seems to exist specifically to delay help.

By contrast, you'll notice, when they ask for food, they don't need to specify the temperature or anything else about the "recipe."

 > **O'BRIEN**: Sir, begging your pardon, but couldn't this wait 'til the morning?

Related question:  Do they not have transporter operators on overnight shifts?  I feel like they have enough other people on this ship in-universe that you should never need to wake *anybody* up.

 > **BARCLAY**: I want you to wake the senior staff.

Doesn't he have the higher rank, though...?

 > **PICARD**: Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerable amount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that you simply imagined---

Shortly before this, Troi asked Barclay why he didn't come forward with his suspicions immediately.  And you know, I can't quite figure out why he might feel reluctant to tell people who immediately dismiss everything new as hysterics.

 > **PICARD**: Commander La Forge, get Mister O'Brien. Take that transporter system apart piece by piece if you have to. Mister Worf, I want a level three security alert until further notice.

Or...maybe they should replicate Barclay's experiment to see if somebody else sees what he sees?  Or does that not have enough dramatic *oomph* for a team that figured that they might try to contain plasma to see if it explodes and kills people?

 > **LAFORGE**: The biofilter should have screened them out, but it didn't.

I mean...they also might not have turned the filters on.  They have a bunch of episodes where they suggest something to that effect, after all.  But also, I find it funny that they felt the need to add a line that says nothing but "something went wrong."

 > **DATA**: Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost.

Given that they could rebuild an entire body for Picard in [*Lonely Among Us*]({% post_url 2022-06-30-lonely %}), I now need to wonder if this fits with the idea that "the crew values Picardâ€™s life above all others," as mentioned in [*Power Play*]({% post_url 2024-08-22-power-play %}).

 > **LAFORGE**: I know, I know. Just give me one more second. We need more dispersion. Increase phase transition frequency

Further suggestions that "rank has its privileges" in a literal sense, La Forge seems willing to sacrifice the life of his colleague and alleged friend so that he can focus on his other project.  If they had Picard or Riker at risk, there, I can't imagine this happening without an extended scene arguing over every fraction of a second.

Anyway, I don't see it as worth quoting a line, but I feel the need to point out that having the security people grasp and hold the lost crew again draws attention to how infrequently these people ever *touch* each other...

 > Captain's log, stardate 46043.6. The reprogrammed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from Mister Barclay and the four crew members. The microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer.

The four crew members who we don't care enough about to even learn their names.  They worked on another ship and all, so they don't really matter...

## Conclusions

As mentioned at the top, we don't get much out of this, though more than I would have expected.

### The Bad

We get the impression that Starfleet doesn't permit officers with uncommon fears, despite a significant portion of the population hiding some fear.  Therapists suggest resolving these issues by pushing through.  And nobody wants to deal with such colleagues, passing them along to whoever they can think of.  Likewise, people get reprimanded for not stating their every observation, but also get told that they probably misunderstood when they report something out of the ordinary.

Therapy continues to look terrible, even when they try to make it look reasonable, this time suggesting that therapists mostly ignore their patients and propose their ideas as treatment.

We find out that, not only does everybody treat the Ferengi badly, but the idea of treating them like peers offends them.

Safety still holds a low priority, with reckless experiments repeated in case something interesting happens.  We also continue to see an authoritarian streak, with rank making people feel more entitled, and lower-ranked visitors mostly ignored.

They continue to use terrible user interfaces that don't have default settings.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the crew goes all-in on its disgust for middle-aged women while quietly overlooking the sexual assault overtones in *Man of the People*.
