* Ignore for ToC

I assume that nobody will notice, let alone care, but I decided to send this post out a bit early, since I may not have access to my computer when I normally would've done so...

Anyway, as [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

If you don't know Bethune, definitely do some research, because the people who you *do* know about made it a point to understand her work and her...

You know, between all the companies working on these projects, it feels like an outside observer could come away with the impression that self-driving cars don't actually work, and almost none of the promises have worked out.  And yet, we'll probably get another round of "only a couple more years" promises...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112479932596635122)

 > How far two or more minds can get along in mutuality depends on the degree of their sincerity towards others. The common ground has to be made, and kept, by moral effort. No joy that is bought at the cost of mental unity is contributory to life, and a joy bought at the cost of anotherâ€™s welfare or at the cost of duplicity of living, is destructive of mental unity.

This shouldn't surprise anybody, *other* than maybe the idea that work abuses us so much that the damage done by discrimination seems less noticeable...

This actually makes an interesting assertion that I'd like to see the numbers for, because if *literally* true, it would show that "trickle-down economics" directly does the opposite, as opposed to only enabling it.

 > As we near the end of **Star Trek:  Discovery**, and since they've built this season as a sequel to **TNG**'s *The Chase* - along with plenty of **TNG** name-dropping, lest you think that even one show in the modern franchise has any criticisms of decisions made in 1987 - I want to state my demands on how to resolve this plot point, finally paying off the most important offhand comment in **TNG**.

 > I like the idea of the *Discovery* crew deciphering an ancient biscuit recipe, staring at it absolutely baffled, and making peace with the Breen over a massive breakfast spread.  At this point, it also seems fitting given Paramount's apparent financial trouble, if took a page from Gene Roddenberry's book and marketed Progenitor Biscuitsâ„¢ with Kwejian Gravyâ„¢ everywhere they could to turn a couple of extra bucks.

I couldn't resist getting in *one* comment about a current series.  In a few months, I'll bring this line up again, because I love it...

Oddly, the article does *not* mention all the times that Alito has raged against his colleagues ever suggesting that they might prefer to not live in a fascist country, trying to shame them into backing away from cases.  And yet, he doesn't seem to mind it so much, when he does it...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
