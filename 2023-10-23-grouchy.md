I couldn't find a single decent holiday for today, and that made me feel grouchy.  And then I discovered that Emmanuel de Grouchy would have celebrated his 257<sup>th</sup> birthday, today, and...OK, sure, he probably pronounced his name something like "groo-SHEE," but I couldn't pass *that* up.

![Manny le Grouch or whatever](/blog/assets/Emmanuel-de-Grouchy.png "No, really, I have no interest in him beyond his name...")

While I decide whether I want to recolor his hair green and have his head poking out of a trashcan, let's talk about projects.

## Smoke Alarm

{% github jcolag/smoke-alarm %}

While I need to do some extensive testing to figure out under what circumstances the code works and when it won't, the page now should allow routine storage of data.

I have also clarified the text on the page and provided some minimal documentation, including a history of the project.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

You might have noticed that the comments section of the blog has some company, these days:  If you don't trust my management of the comments---provided by [Hashover](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next) hosted on the blog's server, by the way, if you wanted to know that---then I formally invite you to discuss issues from posts in the [#entropy-arbitrage chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org) on Matrix.

I'll moderate away any irritating content or [poor conduct](/blog/coc/) as I do, here, and will continue to assume that any posts there follow the blog's CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, so that if you recommend a correction, I can assume that you have already given permission...

In addition to that, I fixed the mammoth/mastodon emoji names---somehow, the official name includes "elephant," conflicting with the actual elephant emoji---and changed the type of the input box on the [search page](/blog/search/) to "search."

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for the [**Morning Dashboard**](https://github.com/jcolag/dash), [**Roku Wake**](https://github.com/jcolag/RokuWake), and [**Slackup**](https://github.com/jcolag/slackup).

## Next

I want to resolve the CORS problem on **Smoke Alarm**, as well as add graphs.
