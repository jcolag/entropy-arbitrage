As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 02 September 2024

Despite doing this every week for at least months, even if we only mean my current process, I forgot to schedule toots in time for Labor Day, so I accidentally gave my followers a vacation day...

## 9:06 -- Tue 03 September 2024

 > In the lecture, Hopper traces the history and inflection points of the computer industry, predicting it will be the largest industry in America ‚Äî as well as some of the challenges it is likely to face as it grows up.

Hashtags:  #GraceHopper #Computing

Definitely give this a try.  Hopper has a series of stock jokes that, due to their careful preparation, mostly fall flat, but she otherwise made an engaging speaker and makes a lot of solid points that---in retrospect---absolutely nobody paid attention to, making them as relevant today as in 1982.

 > ‚ÄúProtecting life,‚Äù according to Project 2025, ‚Äúshould be among the core objectives of the United States foreign assistance‚Äù. It goes on to urge the United States Agency for International Development to stop ‚Äúsupporting the global abortion industry‚Äù.

Hashtags:  #Project2025

While I do consider it good news that the far right has become so weak that they constantly need to circle their figurative wagons globally in order to look viable, it does mean that they now work across borders.  That goes both indirectly, by Project 2025 pushing policy overseas, and directly, by sharing funding and Astroturf campaigns.

 > The virus‚Äôs attachment to cells via its spike protein is the first key step for the virus to fuse with and infect the cells. Current COVID-19 vaccines work by blocking the virus from attaching to cells; the new study shows details of how certain human antibodies can block the next step, virus-to-cell fusion.

Hashtags:  #Covid19

I'd like to remind everybody that, if everybody with the means would have *stayed home* for two weeks at almost any time up until everybody declared the virus endemic and needed to give up on control, we could've wiped this out and not needed to think about it again.  But certain people needed to politicize the existence and severity of the disease, so we still have many people dying every day and a constant stream of vaccines.

 > Still, Black median income today is still nearly $30,000 lower than the white median ‚Äî it‚Äôs not even caught up with the white median income of 1972. And the average Black median wealth of about $45,000 means the vast majority of African Americans fall well short of the $190,000 to $570,000 estimated as necessary to reach middle-class status.

As usual, I assume that most readers don't need me to say this, but we need to solve this problem.  When people say "we should talk about class, not race," they mean that this doesn't matter, and I need to disagree.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Democratic men are stepping up for a woman president by stepping back, at last](https://theconversation.com/democratic-men-are-stepping-up-for-a-woman-president-by-stepping-back-at-last-237297) from The Conversation

 > To be clear, Harris‚Äô early success as a presidential candidate should be attributed, first and foremost, to her skillful and dexterous response to a series of unprecedented events and to the savvy support of the Black women who have long sustained the Democratic Party.
 >
 > But the men of the convention made a collective choice to embrace ‚Äútheir second-fiddle roles,‚Äù as an Axios reporter described it, and treat Harris like a commander in chief. That should be unremarkable. Women have been doing it for presidential candidates since ‚Ä¶ forever. But to see so many white men stepping back so enthusiastically for a woman of color was almost unbelievable. 

I do have some concerns about the media and many individuals latching onto Walz as a new model of masculinity---he uses exactly the traditional model, but doesn't bully people---and a surrogate father figure, but I do appreciate that everybody (not working for corporate media or the Trump campaign) has accepted Harris as the nominee.

 > Each protagonist in this audiovisual project has a unique relationship with the river. If for Ana Gamboa the river is the cradle and home of all her childhood memories, for activist Maria del Pilar Escoba, Cauca was a haven, a place of recreation that was denied to trans women. Twiggy, as she is known in Colombia, grew up in Cali and fled to Europe in the eighties, when paramilitary groups carried out what is sinisterly known as social cleansing, murdering sex workers, homosexuals, homeless people and other marginalized people.

As often happens, Global Voices comes out with an article that runs with a great idea that too few people will read.
