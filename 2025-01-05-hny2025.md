* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Like [last week]({% post_url 2024-12-29-review-2024 %}) followed my now-tradition of looking back on the year, on this blog, I try to pick the first Sunday of the year to look forward at the upcoming year.

![A comic-like scene of a person with white fluffy hair wearing a black sweater reading Happy Year 2025 and a person with long gray hair in a red sweater, in an outdoor scene of mostly reds and browns](/blog/assets/54227303764_d19fc65f36_o.png "I spent a long time rigging up an ugly 2025 image until finding this one that demanded attention...")

Therefore, have a happy new year!  {% emoji party popper %}  As usual, if you use a different calendar, enjoy however you plan to mark the day, too.

## Media

In early years of the blog, I took some time to write about the media that I particularly enjoyed during the past year, and what I looked forward to seeing in the next.  Since I now keep a running list of shows and movies that I watch in the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), it no longer seems worth doing so, here.  That seems especially true, since it never felt right to write extensively here about content that I wouldn't call Free Culture, anyway, at least apart from the [*Star Trek*](/blog/tag/star-trek) posts, a project that has specific analytical goals.

And also, once again, I've found myself increasingly looking forward to *less* media consumption, at least television and film.  I imagine that I'll check out and enjoy some things, sure.  But I don't fit the target demographic of studios, and as I mentioned in last week's post, have canceled subscriptions to almost all streaming services that I had.

We'll see, though.  Maybe some franchise will drag me in so deeply that I subscribe to a bunch of things to follow it...

### Public Domain Day

At least bordering on Free Culture, at the stroke of midnight this past Wednesday, all American media---other than music recordings, which we handle slightly differently---from 1929 fell into the public domain in the United States, assuming that the creators published it here at that time.  I have some examples that I find interesting, on at least some level.

![Edward Hopper's painting Chop Suey](/blog/assets/Edward-hopper-chop-suey.png "Check out discount Alfred Hitchcock pretending that social media exists while he avoids his companion...")

I should note, as always, that I take a stricter approach to my assessments than the various anti-copyright people do.  My [reading of United States copyright law]({% post_url 2020-07-19-pdomain %}) says that American copyrights expire based on when the creator(s) published their works *in the United States*.  Therefore, I ignore works that didn't get an English translation for a few years, yet, or otherwise didn't seem to get an American release in 1929.  Those works seem to get governed by treaties and district courts, rather than rigorous abstract rules, and with all due respect for the people insisting that you should write some Tintin stories or whatever, I can't find a single law or treaty that says that the United States treats overseas publications as if their authors filed for and then renewed a United States copyright after twenty-eight years, if the author would have needed to do that.

#### Might As Well Digress

For completeness, [17 USC §104A](https://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#104a) of our copyright law does pretend that the author jumped through the proper procedural hoops for works with *restored* copyrights in the United States, works that---using [circular 38B](https://copyright.gov/circs/circ38b.pdf)'s description---fit the following key condition, among three others that take less effort to meet.

 > The work is in the public domain in the United States because it did not comply with formalities imposed at any time by U.S. law, lacked subject matter protection in the United States in the case of sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, or lacked national eligibility in the United States.

We care about the first part of the condition, here.  None of the non-U.S. works claimed to lose copyright protection lack subject matter protection (not a form that we recognized as receiving copyright at the time) or national eligibility (we didn't have a copyright treaty with their country at the time).  The question relates to whether they complied with formalities, meant to handle situations such as the [original American edition](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ace_Books) of **The Lord of the Rings** that intended to maintain its copyright but erred in the publication details, leading to legal "pirate" editions for a few years.

In the case of Tintin---I use the property as our example, since it has gotten the most publicity---his appearances *do* have valid copyrights in the United States complying (I assume) with all formalities, but not until the *1960s*, when [**The Blade** and then **Children's Digest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_publication_history) began serializing the stories, much later than their Belgian publication, but much earlier than the restoration process.  The stories can't have had their copyrights restored, then, because they didn't need protection in the United States market until then.  And by the time we amended the law to add §104A, those works had newer copyrights.  By my reading, that means that the first Tintin American copyrights expire in either 2058 when **The Blade**'s run expires or 2053 when seventy years will have elapsed since Hergé's death for his French/European copyright to expire.

It doesn't make much sense, after all, for countries to negotiate to *restore* copyrights to their authors, if doing so gives them many fewer years of protection than requiring the United States to honor their copyright law.  It likewise doesn't make much sense for Congress to enact that restoration, if the works end up in the public domain faster than respecting their native copyrights.

For the record, I don't go through all this to tell you what to do.  Even if I had legal credentials, which I absolutely don't, I wouldn't give legal advice in a blog post.  If you want to reprint and adapt Tintin stories or [**Pather Panchali**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pather_Panchali_%28novel%29) or whatever, go right ahead, though don't expect much sympathy if the estate or holding company or whoever sues you.  Rather, I go through this to explain why I only list works released in the United States, as opposed to those more famous people celebrating famous European works allegedly losing copyright protection here.

Also, if anybody can find the section the law that does say that foreign works that never had formal United States copyrights get a ninety-five-year term of protection, I'd love for somebody to prove me wrong, here.  But I even checked in with the Copyright Office, and they could only point to the same sections and circulars that I already reviewed.  I won't engage in wishful thinking.

#### Novels and Other Prose {% emoji books %}

The books seem more exciting than we've seen in previous years, at least to me.  However, we see more works by women and Black people---the latter, with many works as part of the [Harlem Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance)---than we have seen in recent years.

You can find a variety of other items as part of broader franchises, too, not to mention plenty of non-fiction.

#### Film {% emoji movie camera %}

This list gets fairly long, so I'll skip sifting through for specifics and point you to [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1929).  Of note that I see, you start to routinely see names like [Frank Capra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra), [Douglas Fairbanks Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks_Jr.) and [Loretta Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young), [Lionel Barrymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore), [Barbara Stanwyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck), [Rin Tin Tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rin_Tin_Tin), [Joan Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford), and many more that you'll recognize.

Likewise, I didn't count them up to get a percentage, but odds have increased dramatically that you'll find a "talkie" or even an occasional musical, by clicking through on a title that interests you.

OK, I'll call out *one* film from the full list, because it released first in the United Kingdom, and so probably won't appear on the list of American films.

 * [*Blackmail*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail_%281929_film%29), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, his first sound film

You might have seen collections of Hitchcock's British films that claim to select from the public domain floating around over the years---I certainly have---but this actually makes it in, this time.

Oh, and because no Public Domain Day conversation would feel complete without the obligatory "Down with Disney" moment, you'll also find a dozen (I think) Mickey Mouse cartoons, including the rodent's first speaking role.

#### Music and Other {% emoji musical notes %}

Note that, beyond the following list, music *recordings* began falling into the national public domain in 2022, a first in United States history.  Prior to that, "phonorecord" copyrights have had varying governance by state, with some states having no relevant laws and so no copyright expiration.  This year gives us (I believe) recordings from 1924, with year-by-year expirations until 1947, when copyright expirations will stop for fifteen years.

However, we also have these compositions, including a couple of full musicals.

 * [*Am I Blue?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am_I_Blue%3F), lyrics by Grant Clarke, music by Harry Akst, probably most notable for almost immediately going into the soundtrack of multiple films
 * [*An American in Paris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_in_Paris), George Gershwin
 * [**Connie's Hot Chocolates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie%27s_Hot_Chocolates), most prominently [*Ain’t Misbehavin’*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain%27t_Misbehavin%27_%28song%29) and [*(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Blue_%28Fats_Waller_song%29), lyrics by Andy Paul Razaf, music by Thomas W. “Fats” Waller & Harry Brooks
 * [*Crazy About My Baby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_About_My_Baby), by Blind Roosevelt Graves
 * FDR campaign song [*Happy Days Are Here Again*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_Are_Here_Again), lyrics by Jack Yellen, music by Milton Ager
 * [*Honey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_%28Rudy_Vall%C3%A9e_song%29), lyrics and music by Seymour Simons, Haven Gillespie, and Richard A. Whiting
 * [*Puttin' on the Ritz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puttin%27_On_the_Ritz), lyrics and music by Irving Berlin
 * [*Singin' in the Bathtub*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Bathtub), music by Michael H. Cleary, with lyrics by Herb Magidson and Ned Washington
 * [*Singin’ in the Rain*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_%28song%29), lyrics by Arthur Freed, music by Nacio Herb Brown
 * [*Tiptoe Through the Tulips*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiptoe_Through_the_Tulips), lyrics by Alfred Dubin, music by Joseph Burke
 * [*Waiting for a Train*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_a_Train_%28Jimmie_Rodgers_song%29), lyrics and music by Jimmie Rodgers
 * [**Wake Up and Dream**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_and_Dream_%28musical%29), most notably [*What Is This Thing Called Love?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_This_Thing_Called_Love%3F), by Cole Porter
 * [*You Rascal You*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Rascal_You), lyrics and music by Sam Theard
 * [*You Were Meant for Me*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Were_Meant_for_Me_%28Arthur_Freed_and_Nacio_Herb_Brown_song%29), lyrics by Arthur Freed, music by Nacio Herb Brown

And again, You can find more.  You can also find poetry, if you have more of an interest in that direction.

#### Beyond the United States {% emoji globe europe africa %}

In a lot of the rest of the world, instead, you look at material created by people who died more than seventy years ago.  Therefore, you'd want to look for authors, songwriters, or other artists who died in 1953 to access their work.

#### A Free Culture Plea

While you think about what you might do with all the material dropped into the public domain, this year, please spend a moment to think about *giving back*.

You might notice that, other than using public domain material and these annual Public Domain Day sections, despite talking frequently about copyright law, I almost never discuss the public domain as a concept.  I avoid the topic, and try to distance the public domain conceptually from Free Culture, because I've found that the communities that tend to grow around public domain works tend to focus on exploiting the works by creating new, copyrighted works even while complaining about longer copyright terms or bashing Disney for exploiting the public domain but never giving back.

And sure, you have every right to do that.  We all own that material, to do with as we please, hence "public domain."  But also, what kind of weirdo complains about people pulling the ladders up after them, then does exactly that...?

Anyway, you don't have an obligation to do so.  But if you think that copyright law has grown out of control, then please slap a public license on your public domain-exploiting work, so that the next person can participate.

## Science and Technology {% emoji alembic %}

I honestly can't think of any impending science or technology breakthroughs on the horizon.  Perhaps someone would like to enlighten me on something that I've missed in the comments?

## Law and Politics {% emoji balance scale %}

I imagine that the issue to watch for 2025 include...ugh.  In the United States, all useful effort presumably goes to slowing down the incoming ~~Musk~~ Trump administration's attack on pretty much everybody.  Outside the United States, the effort presumably goes to protecting people from those same attacks.

Like I said, ugh.

## Personal Plans

Increasingly an irritant to me, I find that my plans for 2025 bear more than a superficial resemblance to plans for 2024...and on back to 2022, now that I think about it.  As you might guess from the lack of mention on the blog, my grand "engage more deeply with hobbies" plan didn't really survive contact with the year.  Again.

### Entropy Arbitrage

Last year, talking about how the blog had fallen into something of a rut, in addition to my perennial insistence that I'll learn to draw and post updates---which, no, never manifested---and also said this.

 > I *will* commit to you seeing the beginnings of at least two Free Culture science fiction universes...

And oh, that didn't go as well as I planned.  I've needed to delay **The Light's Edge** a couple of times, so that we haven't quite gotten that rolling, yet.  And the other project, I ultimately needed to abandon.

You see, I envisioned this other space opera universe as based on Frank Herbert's short stories about a character named Lewis Orne, stories which establish many elements that Herbert would later recycle for the *Dune* franchise.  I figured that I could re-read the four stories, pull out the important bits, and publish a blog post describing this universe on whatever weekend coincided with the release of **Dune, Part 2** in theaters.

Then, I had this paranoid feeling that I overlooked something in my copyright checks.  And...yeah, it turns out that I did overlook an item or two...or four.

|Story|Words|Renewal|Magazine|
|-----|------|-------|--------|
|*You Take the High Road*|5,000||RE0000281130 / 1986-01-13|
|*Missing Link*|6,000||
|*Operation Haystack*|9,000|RE 322-816 (1987)|RE0000322816 / 1987-01-09|
|*The Priests of Psi*|20,000|RE 411-005 (1988)||

I assume that you can see the problem:  Two stories of four have active, renewed copyrights, owned by Herbert's estate.  Two magazines of four have copyrights, presumably now owned by Condé Nast.  One story of the four---accounting for only about fifteen percent of the total word-count, and which doesn't introduce any important concepts---sits by itself squarely in the public domain.  That eliminated the chances of doing anything with that idea, at least in my lifetime.

Anyway, this year---almost certainly this month---**The Light's Edge** will definitely go out, even if not in its final form, but it'll serialize on [its own website](https://www.thelightsedge.com/), not the blog, other than announcing at least some parts and talking about the interesting technical details.

More importantly, though, this all suggests a more flexible but equally useful goal.  I want to push out more Sunday posts in 2025, because---as I mentioned in my [five-year retrospective]({% post_url 2024-12-08-five-years %}) post---the Sunday posts feel like "the real" blog to me, the reason that you'd show up here instead of someplace with better search engine optimization and a more regular schedule.  And also, when I have the time to fill in five thousand words with citations, I usually like the results.

Also as mentioned in previous posts, I don't know *how*, but I want to start turning the blog into more of a space for conversations, rather than only having my opinions to share on these assorted topics.

Oh, and I also want to re-engineer my [social-ish](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/socialish/) posts, so that I can maybe post there more regularly than batches with the next blog post.  I may ultimately need to turn it into a second blog, so that it can build and upload faster, since a few minutes turnaround for each post means that I won't go to the trouble of writing them.  However, doing that may spoil the embedding, so I don't know.

### Social Media

Maybe as part of that comment above about trying to get readers more involved, a part of me wants to grow more active on social media, at least Mastodon.

Granted, I don't know *what* I want to post---otherwise I'd already post it---but it feels like my account should have more to it than pre-scheduled weekday posts and blog announcements.  Still don't expect me to post during the day or becoming one of those people who thinks that everybody definitely cares about my strong and detailed opinions on 1980s romantic-comedy mystery shows (I absolutely could) or my food or reactions to headlines or whatever, but I do want to make that space more of "me," so that it doesn't feel like I only care about the Fediverse if I can drum up more readers.  I'll think of something...or I won't.

Otherwise, social media seems mostly stable for the moment.  Other than the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag)---where, by the way, you can see my takes on the media that I watched or listened to, if you miss seeing that kind of talk in these new-year posts---I generally think to post to [my Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag) first, and I'll continue to make sure that those posts mirror to the aforementioned social-ish corner of the blog.  Currently, I also post to [Diaspora](https://nota.404.mn/people/e4313920967a0136074b076893c08a76), [Spoutible](https://spoutible.com/jcolag), and [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/@jcolag), though they currently only get blog post announcements unless somebody addresses me directly.

Will I eventually check to see if Bluesky ever got around to allowing sign-ups on the web?  If they did, will I overcome my distaste of everything about their organization to register?  And if I do register, will I do more there than post blog announcements, ideally through some sort of API?  Only time will tell...

## To the Future {% emoji champagne %}

That summarizes my outlook for the year ahead.  What do *you* look forward to seeing in 2025?
