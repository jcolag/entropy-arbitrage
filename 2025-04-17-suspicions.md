## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Suspicions

Since last we checked in here, **DS9** had former-terrorist Kira try to force someone off his land so that the provisional government could build something important.

We may not get much out of this episode, though, considering that it largely prioritizes its plot and giving the good doctor some attention.

 > **CRUSHER**: Well, you'd better go to Sickbay. I think Doctor Selar's on duty.

Selar still exists.  They introduced her in [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}) and never appeared again, though she has gotten a couple of mentions since.

 > **GUINAN**: A Ferengi scientist. Hmm.

Yeah, it seems bizarre that an interstellar culture might have, you know...scientists. {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **CRUSHER**: But of all the scientists I invited, only four were interested in hearing about Doctor Reyga's invention. And I wasn't altogether sure they were going to be compatible. Kurak was a warp field specialist on the Klingon home world. I don't think Klingons regard scientists very highly. She always seemed a little defensive. Doctor T'Pan is practically a legend in the field of subspace morphology. She's been the director of the Vulcan Science Academy for fifteen years. Her husband, Doctor Christopher, came with her. I didn't know much about him, but he was some kind of subspace theoretician. Jo'Bril was a Takaran, the first one I'd ever met. I had no idea what to expect from him. And then there was Doctor Reyga, the Ferengi scientist.

You might recognize Kurak as [Tricia O'Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricia_O%27Neil), last seen by us playing Captain Rachel Garrett in [*Yesterday's Enterprise*]({% post_url 2023-08-10-yesterday-s-enterprise %}).  Christopher, you might recognize as [John S. Ragin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Ragin), character actor for many years and a major foil on **Quincy, M.E.**.  Jo'Bril, similarly, you might recognize as character actor [James Horan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horan_%28actor%29), who we'll see a few more times from here.

 > **T'PAN**: Forgive my skepticism, Doctor, but your claims are somewhat extravagant. Protect a shuttle within a star's corona? Not even your own government believes it can be done.

For reference, the [Parker Solar Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe) sent out signals during the last week of 2024 verifying that it survived some time traveling through the Sun's corona.  I point this out, because *our* civilization has protected an object in a star's corona, using twenty-first century technology.  Granted, we didn't protect a person inside it, but it suggests a path.

 > **CHRISTOPHER**: I agree. At this point, we need an impartial evaluation.

Do they not think that they can see what happens?  They all talk about this like the experiment will happen in hiding, and they'll need to take the word of the pilot what happened, rather than recording data.  And we'll watch them read the telemetry to each other, so I really don't understand this argument, *except* to underscore how people treat the Ferengi.

 > **REYGA**: Well, if there's anything I'm used to, it's skepticism. After all, a Ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms. No, don't deny it. I know how the Ferengi are regarded.

Speaking of how everybody treats them, check out the Ferengi talking openly about the racism that his people see.

 > **CRUSHER**: At that point, the doubts of the others seemed justified. I had no idea what had gone wrong or how seriously Doctor Jo'Bril had been injured, but I knew this incident could destroy Reyga's chance to be accepted by the scientific community.

Really?  In our world, something that worked for that long and only failed to block certain kinds of radiation would get hailed as a massive win.

By the way, wave to Nurse Ogawa helping out, another character who sits on the periphery, but at least physically exists once in a while.  We last saw her in [*Man of the People*]({% post_url 2024-12-05-man-people %}), I believe.

 > **PICARD**: You're the loneliest person in the world right now. No one can say anything, no one can do anything that will help. And you think that it will never go away. And you're right, it won't. But you can get used to it. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but you can.

While he dresses it up and even gives her an affectionate tap, this still sounds mostly like his don't-act-so-emotional speeches to her...

 > **CHRISTOPHER**: But that won't bring back Jo'Bril, will it?

The show has introduced us to a new creep, I see.  He'll continue to Space-[Karen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Karen#Noun) his way through the episode, in fact, contributing nothing beyond telling people how important he feels.  But here, considering that nothing brings back the dead, does he plan to dedicate his life to doing nothing?

 > **CRUSHER**: I remembered his passion and commitment, and his determination to prove himself, and I was sure that this man had not taken his own life. If anyone could understand that, I knew it would be Captain Picard.

Has she watched the same show that we have...?  And he'll prove us right, not her, because he has no interest in the situation.

 > **PICARD**: You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that the family would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, but you've interfered in the burial rituals of another culture. You've put both of us in a very difficult position. The family will have to be notified. I don't doubt that they will react strongly. If the Ferengi government becomes involved, as I'm certain they will, this could have very significant repercussions. I'm not sure how much I can protect you.

After [*A Matter of Perspective*]({% post_url 2023-08-03-matter-perspective %}) and [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}), plus his emphasis at the end, here, it really feels like this situation has made Picard most angry because he can't cover it up.  Sure, Crusher will lose her job.  And sure, the entire culture looks bad in front of the Ferengi.  But has everybody considered how this will mildly inconvenience the wealthy white guy, if people find out that his reports don't act like obedient little soldiers?

 > **RIKER**: But if you do anything foolish before that inquiry. It's not going to look good for you.

Taking this immediately following [*Frame of Mind*]({% post_url 2025-04-10-frame-mind %}) as it does, they really don't seem to worry much about murder.  It feels consistent if terrible that they'd cover up whatever Riker did last week, but not even wondering about a killer among them seems reckless.

 > **OGAWA**: Is that an order, Doctor?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Yes.
 >
 > **OGAWA**: Too bad you're not my boss now.

This has nothing to do with the post, but as the best line in a long time, I couldn't *not* draw attention to it...

 > **TROI**: Captain, I'm concerned about Beverly. I've tried several times to talk to her, but she's been avoiding me.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I'm not surprised.

Right?  She does her fake-therapy thing to encourage her peers to act out in destructive ways, and, despite her alien ability, has no actual empathy for anybody except her chocolate supplier.  I'd avoid her, too...

 > **RIKER**: That's the Justman, the shuttle Reyga modified.

While the *Enterprise*s have so far named their shuttles to honor physicists, I believe, this one seems to take its name from [Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Justman), producer on the original and this series, occasional director, and likely creator of Gene Roddenberry's "Great Bird of the Galaxy" nickname.

 > **PICARD**: But you can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on a hypothesis.

I feel the need to point out that, in [*A Matter of Time*]({% post_url 2024-07-11-matter-time %}), Picard made a big deal about making reckless choices because it affirms is ability to choose, or some nonsense like that.  Here, Crusher has much more evidence than he had then, but he needs to reprimand her one last time for thinking with her lady-parts and not covering everything up like he ordered.

Speaking of this fake rationality, though...what actually happened in this episode?  We never actually found out how Reyga died, nor why everybody on the Federation side wanted to stifle any investigation and pretend that the shield didn't work.  It feels like the episode wants to tell more of a story, here, but...doesn't.

## Conclusions

A lot of this post went to chasing down references, so as mentioned, I wouldn't expect much, here.

### The Bad

A lot of the episode revolves around bigotry.  Crusher serves as the one person not mystified by the existence of Ferengi and Klingon scientists, with most even suggesting that the former could fake an entire experiment before their eyes.  And nobody (except her employee) treats Crusher as having any insight or experience, dismissing any evidence that she brings.  By contrast, they hold up Picard as some beacon of righteousness.

They seem to consider science a failure unless it produces ideal results, and dismiss anything that doesn't achieve it.

It seems like they prioritize covering up crimes committed in their midst.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we do wacky Klingon religious antics with some shoddy attempts to speak to right-wing Christians, in *Rightful Heir*.
