In the United States, today marks [Veterans Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day), coinciding with and adapting [Armistice Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day) and [Remembrance Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day).  In our case, we go beyond commemorating the end of the [first World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) to honoring military veterans.  And while I don't generally support pro-military messaging, the combination of holidays does feel like it warrants at least a moment of thanks to people who society often treats as disposable.

Anyway, on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The styling for the Codeberg previews now looks more consistent with the GitHub previews.  They have inevitable differences, since GitHub provides us with an image to work with, and it has information about the repository drawn on, while Codeberg doesn't, but it presents similarly, at this point, with some color and divider-size corrections.  Ironically, this goes out in time for a post when I haven't done anything on Codeberg in a while...

Announcements to Mastodon now go out as multi-line posts.  I wanted that when I first started publishing them, but the [`toot`](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot) utility didn't understand multiple lines at the time.  It still doesn't as the one-line command that I previously used, but it now accepts a [here document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document), which works sufficiently well, even if they all foul up the formatting of scripts.

Less important, because I haven't used it yet, the blog now uses the [CC Symbols font](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/creative-commons-unicode-fallback-font.html) for the Creative Commons license components.  In the future---maybe in the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) posts?---this means that I can identify a license using the standard Unicode symbols, such as &#x1f16d;&#x1f16f;&#x1f10e;.  If you copy that, it'll unfortunately paste as gibberish on your machine unless you have a font that similarly supports the code-points---and it angers me that almost no other fonts do, as far as I can find---but it'll display properly on this page.

It works, because CSS has a new-to-me (but not at all new) Unicode range style for fonts.

```CSS
@font-face {
  font-family: CCSymbols;
  src: url(/blog/assets/ccsymbols/CCSymbols.woff2) format(woff2),
       url(/blog/assets/ccsymbols/CCSymbols.woff)  format(woff),
       url(/blog/assets/ccsymbols/CCSymbols.ttf)  format(ttf);
  unicode-range: u+a9, u+229c,
                 u+1f10d-1f10f,
                 u+1f16d-1f16f;
}
```

We care about the last piece, `unicode-range`, here.  It tells the browser to *only* use this font for those eight characters, and use default fonts for everything else.  In theory, you could use the same technique to change the font that you use for numbers or vowels, if you wanted.

Anyway, other than that, I clarified my position on the term [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) on the relevant tag page.

## Cohost Export

{% github jcolag/cohost-export %}

I made sure that the repository complies with [REUSE](https://reuse.software/), since I got a bit sloppy on that point.

And while you won't see me publish the results, because little of it makes sense without the broader context, the repository also now has a second script that'll convert comments into a Cohost-themed webpage.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

Mostly, I started cleaning up some of the code.  I may not continue, honestly, because I don't see the utility when the code has no real organization.

However, I also wrote some quick code to snag the latest [Aurora prediction](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental) from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.  After a couple of incidents where my area apparently got some aurora action that I didn't see, it seemed reasonable to give myself some advanced warning.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump a library version on [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton).

## Next

Now that I have the Creative Commons symbols, I'll probably create a quick plugin for the blog so that posts don't have random Unicode characters in them that most text editors won't render.  It'd make the posts far more readable if I could write something like `{% raw %}{% cc by-sa %}{% endraw %}` and let the code insert the relevant glyphs for me.

Otherwise, I feel like I should have a plan by now, but honestly don't.
