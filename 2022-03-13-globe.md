Geo-Locate Objects Before Enemies!

![A G.L.O.B.E. game in progress](/blog/assets/g-l-o-b-e.png "Gabon has a distinctive enough shape that it's easy to guess on the first try, but that makes for a bad demonstration...")

Last week, I introduced the [**Daily Iungimoji**]({% post_url 2022-03-06-iungimoji %}).  This week, I introduce the [**Daily G.L.O.B.E.**](https://john.colagioia.net/globe/).

As with last week, this is *loosely* inspired by the [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) craze, in that you're using guesses to zero in on your target.  But it's also a problem in multiple dimensions.

Each turn, you guess a country.  The game will tell you how far away the target country sits from your guess, as well as a rough direction.  You can guess as many times as you like, though you "lose"---not that you currently *win* anything---once jumping from guess to guess exceeds the circumference of the Earth.

Is this all too abstract for you?  Here's the game's narrative that I have in my head.

 > Your scientists were able to locate an invaluable artifact of historic significance, but someone jammed their signal before they could tell you where to pick them up.  The good news is that your agents in every country---and some national territories---received the signal, so you can ask them to give you a direction and distance as you check in with them.  You have a travel budget of approximately 25,000 miles, before the agents of E.N.E.M.Y. can snag the artifact for their own collection.

Like I said last week, I wrote this primarily for my personal entertainment, so there's no state-tracking.  There's no work to prevent the player from cheating.  There isn't even a string of {% emoji green_square %}{% emoji yellow_square %}{% emoji green_book %}{% emoji green_apple %}{% emoji bok choy %} emoji or other pseudo-text to flood every marginal online social space that you can find.  However, if you follow the [developer diary posts](/blog/tag/devjournal), you already know that there *is* [source code](https://github.com/jcolag/g-l-o-b-e).

Future versions *might* add the artifacts to the game, as a prize to receive when the player wins---something like artifact-flag emoji pairs {% emoji gem_stone %}{% emoji flag_togo %} stashed in the browser's local storage---though that requires a list of emoji that could be considered artifacts.  Similarly, it wouldn't be out of the question to announce that the player lost the game by having the E.N.E.M.Y. agent {% emoji spy %} (OK, "detective") nab the artifact first.

Like the Daily Nonogram and Daily Iungimoji, the Daily G.L.O.B.E. updates a bit after midnight, [Eastern Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone).
