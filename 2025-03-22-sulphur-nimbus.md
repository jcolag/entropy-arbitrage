To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Sulphur Nimbus:  Hel's Elixir

The game's page has the following description.

 > You are Sulphur Nimbus, a hippogriff who gets stuck on a cursed island during a side quest gone wrong. Collect magical blobs, fight weird monsters, and get lost in the depths of the earth.
 >
 > You'll be able to fly wherever you want, but you're a horse-bird so it won't be easy. As you dive deeper into the island's underground caverns, you must learn to manage your momentum with increasing care and precision.
 >
 > Sulphur Nimbus: Hel's Elixir takes inspiration from momentum-based platformers, six-degrees-of-freedom games, action adventures and collectathons.
 >
 > The project was funded on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oddwarg/sulphur-nimbus-hels-elixir) in 2016. (It took a bit too long to finish.) The source code is available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sulphur-nimbus-hel-s-elixir/). The original soundtrack is available on [Bandcamp](https://oddwarg.bandcamp.com/album/sulphur-nimbus-ost). If you are having trouble, or would like to discuss something else, there is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QpuXhWS).

 > This game is known to cause motion sickness in some individuals, and has a steep learning curve.

I'll admit that I didn't play the game to completion, so I have no idea how the ending plays out.  Most likely, I'll continue to play in short spurts, because I (mostly) enjoyed what I saw.  Despite my enjoyment, though, I hit a point where it looked like the foreseeable future will involve the protagonist repeating the same general task with escalating difficulty, and didn't see that likely to impact what I had to say about the game, nor did I want to have it delay moving to other projects.

## What Works Well?

Despite the large number of controls involved in flight, the game plays surprisingly well, for the most part.  I can definitely see it provoking motion sickness, though.

Also, while it has a fairly minimal story, I do appreciate the half-joking pretext that the game actually happens in the middle of a minor errand gone awry.  You end up quickly forgetting the framing soon enough, but it does feel like it enhances the story more than making this yet another story about a critical person groomed to fight monsters.

The interaction with the dark horse also feels clever, in effect a foreigner trying to communicate without a common language.

Also, this---as usual---relies a lot on taste, but the artistic side of this project carries a lot of the weight, from the cartoon fantasy animals to the multi-genre [soundtrack](https://oddwarg.bandcamp.com/album/sulphur-nimbus-ost).

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

A lot of the game feels poorly organized.  We get a quick tutorial of some controls, which works.  Then we receive a mission.  But the mission plays out in a cut-scene that doesn't end well.  And then we wake up in the middle of an unrelated and extended tutorial.  At the end of it, it takes us back to our game already in progress, where pretty much none of those newly honed skills will come into play for a long time.  And then it repeats that process.  And sure, in retrospect, we should probably treat the tutorials as flashbacks, but nothing in the game gives that indication or makes flashbacks a mechanic to expect.

This might have more to do with my skill than the game, and so people who grew up on 3D-platform games might disagree, but I found the island sequence probably too difficult to enjoy.  In flying, it makes some sense to have the aforementioned variety of controls, because you need to maneuver through a volume.  But when running, including across fussy narrow paths, and jumping makes a flight simulator irritating.

## Opportunities

First, you can buy the game, currently six bucks American.

It doesn't look like anybody has touched the code in about a year, but the project has a [Sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sulphur-nimbus-hel-s-elixir/)---because no other repository hosting still supports [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)---with at least one other contributor.

They also have a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/QpuXhWS), which I didn't investigate.  And the comments on Itch also seem extremely lively.

## What's Adaptable?

Nothing really gets a name that I can recall---though I see various names in the files that configure the game, and you can guess two major character names from the game's title---but this game gives us the mysterious island and its inhabitants, including a castle and a variety of cyborg(?) monsters.  It also has a kind of system for magic, at least the start of one.

You can also find the aforementioned soundtrack, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) models of a lot of what you see on-screen, a series that looks like concept art but may contribute to other flashbacks based on the naming conventions, and probably more that I didn't have time to find.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll read **Nose Ears**.  The comic has released around a thousand strips.  I don't want to overwhelm anybody---especially myself---trying to condense the highlights of that many comics into one post and don't want to prolong the experience too far, so we'll handle this like we do lengthy novels, three posts each covering...let's say blocks of fifty strips, by numbers, not by counting them.  And we'll start with *Hate* (#1) through *Climate Catastrophe* (#50).  If you reach *Malicious Software*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
