As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Already, insights into users‚Äô reproductive health, medical conditions, or mental health is being drawn from their browsing habits, location data, and app usage, and used to target people with ads for costly medications or fertility treatments. Some advertisers even peddle unproven wellness products to chronically-ill people.

I won't bother to hunt for it now, but I often find myself thinking of the short animation that I saw in the mid-1990s joking about mergers and Big Data excitement leading to a situation where ordering a pizza becomes a Byzantine gauntlet of getting waivers from your doctor (because your insurance doesn't want you raising your cholesterol), your banker (because you seem to have gotten close to your credit limit), and others.  And congratulations, we still have that mess on the horizon, led by billionaires who believe in eugenics and that most of us don't really exist at all, because they think that we live in a simulation[^MW2POb] for their benefit...

[^MW2POb]:  Incidentally, have you ever given any thought to the *math* on simulations?  As in, once you allow for the assumption that we live in a constructed world, what the odds look like that (a) anybody has reality outside said simulation, and (b) how many layers of simulations would likely exist between us and reality.  The former seems so absurdly low and the latter so absurdly high that I have to imagine that even if the clowns had it right, you still need to treat this like the only world that we have, because you *absolutely* won't get out.

The headline misdirects a bit by talking about "years," but this apparently started at the end of Trump's first term and happened largely in secret since then.  In other words, for all the whining about the "deep state"---by which the right means non-partisan bureaucrats who do the same job no matter who sits in the Oval Office---they built an off-the-books surveillance operation beholden to them.

This doesn't surprise me at all.  Last month, we found out that [AI makes programmers slower](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/), generating [less secure code](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/101801-ai-introduces-security-vulnerabilities-within-code-in-45-of-cases) for that extra overhead.  And unlike the old jokes about television, using AI actually *does* [rot your brain](https://www.404media.co/microsoft-study-finds-ai-makes-human-cognition-atrophied-and-unprepared-3/).

The large language model technology has its uses, don't get me wrong.  Using "embedding models" for semantic searches---checks that compare the calculated intent of the search string against the calculated intent of every paragraph in a collection of documents, for example---makes digital life a lot easier, and as I've written elsewhere, I have gotten good results by handing a model a company website and asking it to find me the URL to the open positions, which would take a lot of effort to program correctly, since different companies use different words and phrases for it, and I'll soon (when I have the time, I mean; it shouldn't take much actual work) take the next step of have it filter out the jobs that have nothing to do with me.  However, chatbots look precisely [engineered for a con job](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/) to keep investments rolling into [companies that can't ever turn a profit](https://futurism.com/ai-far-away-profit-experts-warn), because the dingbats in charge believe that this will probably [make a literal god for them](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/785407/peter-thiel-antichrist-tech-regulation).

 > Anyway, Omarchy and Ladybird are both run by fascists. Omarchy makes this pretty obvious from the outset ‚Äì on the home page the big YouTube poster image prominently features SuperGrok, which is a pathetically transparent dog-whistle to signal alliance with Elon Musk‚Äôs fascist politics. Omarchy is the pet project of David Heinemeier Hansson, aka DHH, who is well known as a rich fascist weirdo.

Cloudflare always seemed a bit shady to me, so this rather clearly confirms that impression.  As DeVault indicates, Omarchy seems like an extreme dog whistle kind of choice, because most of its work happens in *upstream* projects, which they integrate, so if you want a better product, you should put money into the projects that they use, not into the integration.

Anyway, as a reminder, speaking of the rich fascist weirdo, if you have a GitHub account, you can help [encourage the Ruby on Rails team](https://github.com/Plan-Vert/open-letter) to put some distance between his nonsense and a project that otherwise does a lot of good in the industry.

Maybe see also [Meta is Removing Abortion Advocates' Accounts Without Warning](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/meta-removing-abortion-advocates-accounts-without-warning) from Deeplinks.  I have to actually give the EFF credit for really digging into Meta's anti-abortion garbage over the past week...sorry, I meant that the EFF has worked the story over last week; Meta has engaged in the bad behavior for longer.  For too many years the folks at the EFF focused their attention exclusively on trying to curb government, even as we could all see Big Tech trying to stomp on civil liberties online, but once in a while, they wake up from their libertarian slumber.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Sens. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill on Wednesday to re-establish national emergency suicide prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth‚Äîwhich have been stripped by the Trump administration at a time when the vulnerable group needs it most.

Look, Murkowski seems completely useless on a normal day, but if her name gets this through, good for her.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Resistance training may slow aging](https://www.futurity.org/resistance-training-nerve-health-aging-3295962/) from Futurity

 > For their study, the researchers sought to determine the effects of resistance training on nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and if changes in NCV are dependent on age. Testing 48 subjects ranging from 18 to 84 years old, the researchers recorded NCV in the forearm and maximal strength before and after four weeks of handgrip training in both arms (training was conducted three times a week).

To everybody's surprise, doing healthy things has benefits...

More seriously, it actually does seem like interesting results that exercise improves life over the long term.

 > Seen this way, defiance isn‚Äôt a fixed trait that some people are born with and others lack. It‚Äôs a practice: a skill you can strengthen over time. Some days you might comply, other days you might resist. What matters is that you have the awareness and the tools to make the choice consciously, rather than letting fear or habit decide for you.

I like the "what does a person like me do in a situation like this" question.

But her resistance didn‚Äôt stop there. During the Civil War, she worked with the Union army as a cook, a nurse, a scout, and a spy. She helped the North to free hundreds of enslaved people. She was an icon who even later in life would fight for women‚Äôs suffrage ‚Äî the women‚Äôs right to vote.

An excellent interview, by the way.
