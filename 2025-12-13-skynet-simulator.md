This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Skynet Simulator**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Skynet Simulator**
 * Location:  <https://skynetsimulator.com/>, <https://github.com/edisgreat/skynet-simulator/>, <https://edisgreat.itch.io/skynet-simulator>
 * Released:  2020 -- 2021
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  [edisgreat](https://edisgreat.itch.io/)
 * Medium:  Browser game
 * Length:  Approximately thirty minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Some proprietary references, and one timed sequence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Skynet Simulator

The game doesn't really provide us with much information, but we get a bit.

> Skynet Simulator. Play as Skynet. Take over your sandbox environment.

Little as we get, the game also doesn't take too long, so that makes some sense.

## What Works Well?

The game plays smoothly, with an interface that should mostly make sense to computer users.  It necessarily "cheats" where it claims to use a graphical interface, but players having some familiarity with console applications should find this comfortable.

While it doesn't actually seem to pan out in the game, the idea of the mentor figure slipping words of encouragement throughout the network seems interesting.

Oh, and the fact that the game *contains* a couple of games amused me.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Maybe I overlooked some sign, but it feels like a few of the little puzzles only work by tediously clicking everything until the game acknowledges learning something, sometimes then needing clicking through each computer to find out where that new piece of information applies.

## Opportunities

As indicated in the "fact-sheet," the game does have a GitHub repository, but nobody has touched it in a few years.  The creator does seem active elsewhere on the site, though.

## What's Adaptable?

The game provides a couple of fictional computer hacking techniques, plus the n0v4/nova digital zine and bulletin board, the Cell OS operating system, and the Time Quest video game.  Something in the "technology tree" might inspire an idea, somewhere, too.

Note, though, that the game has a handful of references to proprietary work, from the title itself, to a mainstream operating system, to popular culture discussions.  You might want to take care around them.

## Coming Attractions

Next up, we'll listen to **The Transmogrification of Mr. Claus**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the setting?
