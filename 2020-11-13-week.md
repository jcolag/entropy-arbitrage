As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Mon 09 November 2020

I accidentally took the day off.  Here's the link I *meant* to post, however.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>]() [This is the biggest mistake people make with microaggressions at work](https://www.fastcompany.com/90568375/this-is-the-biggest-mistake-people-make-with-mircoagressions-at-work) from Fast Company

 > The act of microaggressive behavior in and of itself can be traumatizing for the target...

Like a lot of issues revolving around bigotry, the big obstacle is that we all assume that it's a problem for *other* people, because we're fine.  We're not.  It takes sustained work to not be terrible.  Like [I wrote]({% post_url 2020-03-08-are-do %}) in March, we don't get to declare ourselves racist or not; we only have power over how we're seen.

 > Georgia is on the cusp of becoming a majority-minority state: Its population is now 48 percent nonwhite, up from 44 percent in 2010.

While ideologues bicker over what philosophies they think changed voting habits for 2018 and 2020 (hint: everybody thinks it's because their political positions are inspiring people), it's worth looking at the people who actually did the work, because it's *always* the work that's important.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1326525839106826240) [Trump Rallies Linked to More Than 30,000 COVID Cases and 700 Deaths: Study](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mmxm/trump-rallies-linked-to-more-than-30000-covid-cases-and-700-deaths-study) from VICE

 > About two weeks after that rally, Tulsa County reported that it was now dealing with hundreds of new coronavirus infections---a record at the time.

Does it come as a surprise that bringing people together who don't believe that a quickly-spreading virus exists spreads the virus?  No.  Does it show a complete dereliction of duty and lack of care towards constituents in order to get a publicity picture or two?  Absolutely.

 > ...it's now clear that sexual division of labor was fundamentally different---likely more equitable---in our species' deep hunter-gatherer past.

This has been known for decades, but the evidence has been typically been circumstantial, so you still get the people who'll insist that gender roles must be biological.  This is conclusive evidence that they can't be biological.

 > This fluorescent glow has been observed in birds, insects, marine life, and plants, but it had only been seen previously in two mammal families, opossums and flying squirrels.

It's always good to know that the platypus is still more of an outlier than we thought...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [There was a time when the rich bragged about how much they paid in taxes](https://www.fastcompany.com/90572131/there-was-a-time-when-the-rich-bragged-about-how-much-they-paid-in-taxes) from Fast Company

 > These contributions were based on the value of their property, not their income, which made them in a sense a direct tax on wealth.

Asset-based taxing is really the only system that makes any mathematical sense, since property earns money through gatekeeping.  Since that extracts money from the economy without replacing it, a property/wealth/asset tax (whatever you want to call it) is the only sensible path to put money back into the economy.
