As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Since [#Twitter](https://mastodon.social/tags/Twitter) seems to want to continue its nosedive, if you have the means (by which I mean that, if instructions say to run Node.js, you have some idea of what that means), give some thought to publishing an archive of your tweets. It has some hiccups, but I got surprisingly good results with [tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback)

 > It even has a lookup system so that, once they update their registry, retweets and replies link to the person's archive instead of the original site...

A one-off toot, hoping to get some company in this space---and more eyes on a nice project---though I assume that readers here already know about [my Twitter archive](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/) from my [developer diary posts](/blog/tag/devjournal), where most February posts mentioned it.

It turns out that regulations and organized labor works.  Leaving companies to spontaneously "do the right thing" doesn't work.

 > Blumenauer explains that a larger House could improve the quality of representation and increase constituents' access to their elected officials by reducing the number each member serves.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Congress

I've hoped for something like this for at least fifteen years, though I think that this particular bill doesn't go far enough.  A big part of me says that we should have enough representatives so that each can each meet with each of their constituents during a given session, if necessary.  You might rightly point out that we can't fit that many people in the Capitol, and I'd agree and call that a feature, rather than a bug:  Let Representatives telecommute, so that lobbyists need to crisscross the country pouring money into local economies to wine and dine enough people to sway a vote.

ProPublica has covered this story for many years, and I appreciate that.  Every year, I resort to doing my taxes with one of the big-two providers, and while I consider it a failure, I at least take some enjoyment in filling out the survey telling them that I'd never recommend the service to anybody, because I oppose their active perversion of the system.  My harsh words won't change their policies, but if I can get *one* person to quit, making it slightly harder for them to operate, I'll call that worth it.

You'll notice how many of our problems interrelate, I hope.  Over a couple of decades, corporate America began consolidating at a rapid rate, and we've all suffered for that.  And a lot of those problems have begun cresting, with fake inflation, enforced unemployment, predictable environmental disasters, and tractors that you can't repair for fear that you'll use the onboard computer to illegally download music...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://makewealthhistory.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/heat-pump.jpg|A heat pump mounted to the exterior of a home with black-painted wood shingles over white-painted brick|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Seven heat pump myths](https://earthbound.report/2023/02/21/seven-heat-pump-myths/) from The Earthbound Report

 > They use electricity to run the pump, and draw ambient heat from the environment. By using this free low-level warmth from the air, they generate three units of heat for every unit of electricity they consume. So if you currently use the average of around 12,000 kilowatts of gas energy every year to heat your home, you‚Äôd need 4,000kw of electricity to deliver the same heating with a heat pump.

Hashtags:  #Sustainability

I found this overview interesting, not least because the myths seem to apply to almost all sustainable technologies.

{% cw Child Soldiers, Human Trafficking %}

 > Children who have been used by armed actors do not reintegrate easily. Depending on when they were used and how old they were at the time, they may return to civilian life still as children or as adults. Regardless, many of them will be viewed with suspicion, stigmatized, or outright rejected by their families, communities, governments, and even the international community.

Hashtags:  #Trafficking

I don't have much to say about this, but we (the international community, not my readers and I) definitely need to do something to fix these problems.
