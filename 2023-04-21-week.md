As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The group‚Äôs goal of researching metal-free batteries stems from having better control over the domestic supply chain since cobalt and lithium are outsourced. This safer chemistry would also prevent battery fires.

I assume that this causes other problems, but I don't suppose that they could make much worse than we have today...

I unfortunately forget who, but one Arab-American comedian---probably not Maz Jobrani, though nobody else's voice comes to mind on this---used to talk about how he desperately wanted to audition for an acting gig where he didn't need to hold his eyes open wide enough to show his entire iris for the entire role...

I'll say what I always say when big issues come up:  Write your representatives, at the level that you care about (federally, in this case) and one level down (state).  Explain your position in the community, such as a homeowner, entrepreneur, church official, whatever you've got.  Explain your stake in the matter, even if you only consider yourself a concerned citizen worried about the treatment of half the population, but any expertise on the issue would help at this point.  And state your views on the topic.

Do it *on paper*, to both their local office and their "official" office---for example, the Capitol building or the state capital---and mention especially to the lower offices that you'd like them to put pressure on the others.

If you can manage it, make an appointment to *speak* with your representatives, as well.  I like to say that, if your legislators don't recognize your name and maybe roll their eyes when they hear it, then you'll only get your way accidentally.

 > The stated purpose of all this surveillance is to prevent ‚Äúwaste, fraud, and abuse‚Äù by those on Medicaid. But as anyone who‚Äôs dealt with the American health care system can tell you, the real fraud comes from profiteering health care corporations, not patients.

I suppose that I should make the point that Republicans hate Medicaid because it actually works.  They'd much rather an onerous system that fails to help anybody, so that they can go back to telling people about how Big Government always fails everyone...

Hashtags:  #MediaLiteracy #TedCruz

Honestly, even if you don't care about Ted's dopey and destructive antics, the headline does a lot, here.  I always object when people talk about the "good old days," when reporters only presented facts and didn't take sides, because they *did* take sides.  They chose to prioritize one story over another, one source over another, and one framing over another.  They might not have done so maliciously---they only had so much time and space to work with---but they definitely made those decisions, and the news only makes any sense when we understand that and apply it in reading.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

A blessed Eid to those who celebrate.  May every year find you in good health.  (And apologies if I fouled that greeting up in trying to not embarrass myself by making a mess of Arabic.)
