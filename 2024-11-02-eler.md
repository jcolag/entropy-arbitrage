To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Everybody Loves Eric Raymond

The author describes the comic as follows.

 > Everybody Loves Eric Raymond is a web comic depicting the very real lives of Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond and Linus Torvalds as accurately as comedically possible.
 >
 > Their real lives, which include living together in a house, with dynamic dimensions, without their wives or girlfriends. Also, they always wear the same clothes. And don’t move their eyes much.

To catch up those readers unfamiliar with the comic's major characters, I'll provide some quick explanations.

 * The [Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond) of the title came to prominence writing [*The Cathedral and the Bazaar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar), convinced people to shift to the term "Open Source" to make Free Software more palatable to companies while undermining its reciprocal-sharing/"copyleft" ethos, and has made it increasingly clear over the decades that he hates pretty much everybody not a straight white man.  The last eventually forced the Open Source Initiative, which he co-founded, to ban him from mailing lists, after he started railing against codes of conduct.
 * [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) largely started the Free Software Movement, and has become largely known for limiting his activism to insisting on everybody using his terminology for everything, which we all ignore.  He (later) resigned from the FSF after people connected his repeated and vocal insistence that minors can totally consent to sexual activity with his defense of colleagues associated with Jeffrey Epstein.  He also has [documented problems](https://stallman-report.org/)[^1] with diversity and letting women feel safe, so of course the FSF asked him to return once the Epstein story died down, because they "missed his wisdom."
 * [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) created and still leads development on the Linux kernel.  Like the other two, he has a reputation for tactless interactions with people, occasionally suggesting that they should die.  The widespread commercial usage of Linux has also led to a variety of conspiracy theories about how he secretly serves corporate interests (somehow) undermining the Free Software movement.

[^1]:  The report came out shortly after I finished writing this post, conveniently enough.  And if you tell me that the report represents "an attack on Free Software," then realize that I'll know that you identify Stallman's garbage behavior *as* the movement, and treat you accordingly.

They have often picked fights with each other, too, which the comic draws on more than once.

## What Works Well?

Beating on Eric Raymond's hypocrisy and bigotry can't go *too* far wrong, I suppose.

I also admittedly giggled at the idea of launching the GPL v2 by coming down a mountain with stone tablets as [Vanilla Ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_Ice)'s music plays in the background.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

A lot of this may come down to personal taste, but most of the jokes didn't really land, for me.  Many of the "jokes," as indicated in the content advisories, rely on coming up with things that extremely problematic people would say, and "ironic" bigotry never works.  Others seem to rely on taking the sides of different characters in their arguing.

Also, plenty of the strips require having in-depth knowledge of petty in-fighting in the Open Source community at the time.  And in a few cases, the joke doesn't do more than *mention* an incident.

And honestly, the framing of Raymond as an outlier of the group feels wrong and definitely didn't age well.  They *hint* at Torvalds's corporate-friendly policies or Stallman's---pardon the understatement---difficulties with women, but they limit those to rare jokes that seem intended as endearing, and usually default the two characters as "the good ones."

## Opportunities

I seriously doubt that anybody still touches this.  I barely *found* it, and they haven't published anything in fifteen years.

## What's Adaptable?

Apart from the alternate versions of these three real people---which I wouldn't really advise using, except as similar parody in another project, because they have rights to privacy and so forth---we have the alternate-2015 where Linux-based robots conquered the world so that [Tux Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_Racer) can run at 8000 fps, overflowing word balloons to impact other comic strips, and "hot seedling action" at <http://rhinophytonecrophilia.com>, a site that houses the relevant panel from the comic.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll watch **Route 66:  An American (Bad) Dream**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic?  I honestly don't know how I feel about it, since it made some uncalled-for personal attacks, but also does so against people who have more than earned some nastiness...
