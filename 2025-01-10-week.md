* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

At this point, a story like this probably won't surprise anybody.  At its heart, insurance definitionally drives up prices, because they need to bring in more money than they pay out to survive.  But add a generation of business consultants, and a necessary evil---forcing people to set aside money for emergencies and covering shortfalls---transformed into a system that would rather scrap the necessity parts of their jobs.

I've noticed, over the years, that right-wing thought generally has two major characteristics.  First, as we all know, it serves to justify hate and fear, to keep the underclasses fighting so that we don't stand up against them.  Second, as highlighted by Rosenthal's post, it relies on tunnel vision that ignores the actual causes of problems, so that they can blame whatever they please, whether in economics or international politics.

It seems like one heck of a coincidence that we consistently tear down parts of areas that help people, but only in already-disadvantaged neighborhoods, doesn't it...?

Beyond this specific attack on Wikipedia---because it serves as one of the few places where people regularly come to a consensus on any number of topics---I do find it interesting to see the difference in reactions to it versus every minor attack on the far-less-critical Internet Archive.  When somebody bad-mouths the Archive or hits it with some denial-of-service attack, people treat it as an unforgivable affront to everything that we stand for, and shovel money at them.  When Wikipedia comes under threat, people mostly ignore it...or they'll whine that the Wikimedia Foundation already has plenty of money, as if that makes them untrustworthy, despite their transparency.

I sometimes marvel how, time after time, we consistently discover that doing the right thing frequently provides the greatest benefits to society, too, whereas doing the selfish thing only helps the already-wealthy.  And yet, we have this inane insistence in culture that the reverse *must* hold true, presumably because we want benefits to require massive sacrifice.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > For LGBTQ Hmong people, there was another reason the Twin Cities were a draw. Minneapolis has been home to active [gay rights](https://daily.jstor.org/the-stonewall-riots-didnt-start-the-gay-rights-movement/) organizations since the 1960s, and in 1970 was the site of the first attempt by a gay couple, Jack Baker and Michael McConnell, to get a legally recognized [marriage license](https://daily.jstor.org/the-long-history-of-same-sex-marriage/).

I recommend reading the full article, and probably the papers that it links to.

 > "For a long time, I had an idea for a story where two opposite worlds would clash, something grim and something cute, and I figured now was the perfect time to bring it to life. Zombies can be both grim and fun, offering endless opportunities for wild stories. Lucy, on the other hand, is cute and cheerful (most of the time) and breaks the stereotypical image of a necromancer."

I have to admit that I don't love the framing of fixing stereotypes of *necromancers*, but this still looks like fun.
