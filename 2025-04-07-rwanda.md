Today marks the [International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Rwanda Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Reflection_on_the_1994_Rwanda_Genocide) (against the Tutsi, among others), for pretty much what the name says.  The non-Rwandan observation generally includes joining in a minute of silence to remember the hundreds of thousands dead and a similar number of known cases of sexual violence.  Unfortunately, the extreme violence made for sensationalist and implicitly racist headlines at the time, simultaneously framing the atrocities as routine and as a problem for "those people over there," as opposed to the West where we could "*never*" imagine our own neighbors turning on us for ethnic reasons.

If you don't want that downer, we also celebrate [World Health Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Day) today.  For the last couple of decades, the day has a theme, from 1991's *Should Disaster Strike, Be Prepared* to this year's *Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures*.  Huh.  Yeah, that'll go over well in the United States, this year...

Anyway, on to the projects.

## Open Badges

{% github jcolag/badging %}

While it probably doesn't complete the process, but the code has dropped the attempt at direct manipulation via [JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD) and replaced that nonsense with the creation of a [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).  Creating the signature from the JWT creates a binary mess that we can't add as metadata, so---unless I misread the specification---it builds a hexadecimal representation.

Again, definitely don't rely on this code, yet.  It could completely misunderstand how this should work.  But I *think* it edges closer...

## Ham Newsletter

{% github jcolag/ham-newsletter %}

As I've probably mentioned, at some point soon, I want to move my server.  While I haven't had a *problem* with Linode, their purchase by Akamai seems to have stalled any advancement, and it feels like a multi-billion-dollar company doesn't need my money.  Plus, not to put too fine a point on it, but much as Linode's use of virtual machines represented an order of magnitude more economical service than its predecessors, we now have a generation of VPS providers that operate have substantially cheaper offerings again, and it seems wasteful to spend hundreds of dollars per year to run the blog.

Now, step two of this explanation.  I've started looking at alternatives for running the handful of services that I have up on the old digital homestead.  I have shuttered a few, stopped using others as I've reorganized, and pared it down to the RSS feed reader, currently [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/).  The software hasn't given me any real/persistent problems, either, but I do often note that they make poor decisions like putting their git repository behind some sort of not-a-bot process that makes it useless most of the time, and their support forums strike me as unfriendly.

After wondering if I could manage with a desktop RSS reader and weighing a move to [Fresh RSS](https://freshrss.org/), I realized that [Disroot](https://disroot.org)---which I already use for other reasons[^1] enough that I should probably start donating to them soon---runs a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) with the RSS feed reader ("News") plugin.  As such, I've started giving that reader a test drive, with a strong possibility that I'll shift to using it for my RSS needs.

[^1]:  Given that they also host a [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance and a [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.org/) installation, too, among other things, you might want to give Disroot a look and throw them some money, too.

That feels like a *really* long way around of explaining that the newsletter-generating code now includes a script to grab the articles saved during a particular month.  It takes a lot of its cues from the Tiny Tiny RSS version, but the Nextcloud plugin uses an unrelated API, so it required a different structure.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

This has two changes, one useful and the other a result of disappointment.

For the disappointing change, the code no longer grabs the most recent Voice of America newscast.  As many of you might know, the Trump administration put almost the entire agency on leave, because soft power terrifies them and a free press that counters authoritarian propaganda doesn't interest them.  Due to the effective closure of their offices, their hourly newscast hasn't gotten an update in weeks.  It turns out that I don't actually need a morning update on news from a few weeks ago.

And as a useful bug-fix, it turns out that the [TV Maze](https://www.tvmaze.com/) API doesn't always include a channel name, so the code makes those names optional when reporting the day's television.

## Boring CSS

{% github jcolag/boring-css %}

Our favorite it-doesn't-seem-worth-using-a-framework CSS package added a couple of new color schemes.

On the professional side, it now supports something deriving from [Uchu](https://uchu.style/), most notable for designing its color distribution around the [OKLCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) color space, which uses a cylindrical model---hue as a circle, with radius and height mapping to one each of lightness and saturation-like "chroma"---and aims for perceptual uniformity.  In other words, a 60% lightness for a blue looks as bright as a 60% lightness for a red or yellow, and the same for chroma.  Most current browsers should support `oklch()` in CSS, but as I learned with `light-dark()`, some people on extended-support release browsers might not yet have it since most browsers added support less than two years ago.

Then, more for the entertainment value, because I used **Boring CSS** specifically for the [archive of my Cohost posts](https://jcolag.github.io/cohost/), it only seemed right to share it.  I don't think that anybody would confuse my rendition with the actual Cohost for any length of time, but I also didn't have any interest in it *tricking* anybody, only pay tribute to the site.

## Next

I hope to get deeper into the Open Badges work, this week, but I can't guarantee that something else won't distract me again...
