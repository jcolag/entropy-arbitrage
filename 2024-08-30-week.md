As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

On Sunday, I'll take a look at this idea by tying it in with the Republicans panicking about Tim Walz calling them weird.

I admittedly don't understand the ramifications, here, but it at least seems interesting...

This makes two articles, this week, that I need to say this for:  I'll raise this issue in Sunday's post, and tie it to that upset over "weird."

You know how this goes.  If we understand the actual world, then we might realize that all their bigotry has no basis in reality, and we can stop them...

As usual, the speech holds as much power today as it did then, to the country's shame.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Flohmarkt is a Fediverse Marketplace](https://wedistribute.org/2024/08/flohmarkt-federated-market/) from We Distribute

 > One extremely interesting here is acknowledging a limitation of today‚Äôs Fediverse: not every instance admin or user can use an integrated payment system. Instead, this platform allows users to privately message each other directly to handle the transaction out-of-band.

The system looked interesting when I checked it out, but without much for sale and little of it near enough to me that I'd bother.  However, I do like the idea and can see this growing quickly.

Newsmax, you might recall, needed to [apologize for spreading election conspiracy theories](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/30/992534968/newsmax-issues-retraction-and-apology-to-dominion-employee-over-election-stories) in hopes of overturning Biden's election.
