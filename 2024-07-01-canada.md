I often reach for American holidays, because I find them close at hand as a New Yorker, but only a few hundred miles from here, Canada celebrates the founding of the [Canadian Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Confederation) as [Canada Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Day).

If you want a narrower demographic, certain Bulgarian communities celebrate(d) the [July Morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Morning) festival, which---like a lot of holidays, this time of year in the Northern Hemisphere---seems to mostly work as an excuse to stay awake through one of the year's shortest nights.

And on we go to the projects.

## Boring CSS

{% github jcolag/boring-css %}

My CSS non-framework now has two additional color schemes that happened to come to my attention during the week.

[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) calls itself a "soothing pastel theme for the high-spirited."  They place a heavy weight on community involvement, which I wouldn't expect, given that they...only maintain color schemes.  Technically, they have four palettes, light (latte), muted (frappé), medium (macchiato), and dark (mocha).  I made an executive decision and chose their *latte* scheme as the boldest and probably most suitable for this kind of project, but if anybody wants one of the other "flavors," they don't take much effort to write...

[Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) describes itself as "all natural pine, faux fur and a bit of Soho vibes for the classy minimalist."  It similarly maintains three variants---the original, Moon, and Dawn---of which **Boring CSS** implements the original only.

## The Light's Edge

{% codeberg jcolag/thelightsedge %}

After some experimentation, I discovered that I could alter the site's CSS in a way that looks ugly to me, *but* in trade makes the pages look the same in their Codeberg preview as they do on the official deployed website.

The "one trick"?  I previously used absolute paths for the fonts.

```css
src: url('/fonts/LeagueSpartan-VF.woff2');
```

However, since Codeberg Pages doesn't deploy to the domain's root, the fonts don't actually live at `/fonts`, so I need to use a relative path.

```css
src: url('../fonts/LeagueSpartan-VF.woff2');
```

See?  I told you that it looked ugly.  However, it now means that, if you want to see how the pages look before I deploy them---I still await approval on one account before I finalize certain things---then you can visit [**The Light's Edge** on Codeberg Pages](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/thelightsedge/).

## Fictopedia Archive

{% codeberg jcolag/fictopedia %}

As promised [last time]({% post_url 2024-06-24-inti-raymi %}), I have started building an archive of the material that I "rescued" from Fictopedia, before the site collapsed.

In addition to the pages converted to HTML, the pages use styles from **Boring CSS** to---I hope---maximize readability.  I also scrounged up the images, including the absurdly tiny project logo (see below) and the "favorites" icon, which should both appear on every page, by the time that you read this.

![Fictopedia's logo, the name of the site in brackets, resting at an angle](/blog/assets/Fictopedia-Logo.gif "Actual size.  I couldn't find a larger version, and have no idea if they produced one.  However, I do know through painful experience that scaling the image up will only make it worse.")

The `README` documentation also mostly reflects what I wrote for the index page's introduction.

Anyway, you can start reading at my [Fictopedia Archive on Codeberg Pages](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/).  If you want a taste of what you have in store, there, in terms of both the general style of content *and* the many missing pages, I might recommend the [Worldwide Wormhole Complex](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Worldwide_Wormhole_Complex.html) as an interesting article with an original concept, that has many links to articles that expand on different parts of the concept, many but not all of which exist.  If you want something shorter and sillier, you might check out the [Emotive Hats](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Emotive_hats.html), of which four related articles---clustered at the end of the list, if you'd like to save yourself some frustration---survived.  But it has an interesting selection of mundane, fantasy, science fiction, and probably other genres.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), the [**Generic Board Game**](https://github.com/jcolag/generic-board-game), the [**Little Scuttlers**](https://github.com/jcolag/LittleScuttlers), [**Miniboost**](https://github.com/jcolag/Miniboost), the [**Renewals DB**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB), [**Salavi**](https://github.com/jcolag/salavi), and [**Uxuyu**](https://github.com/jcolag/Uxuyu).  That clears out my current queue, for now.

## Next

I have more work to do on the Fictopedia archive, including small improvements to the CSS, content salvaged from the Internet Archive, working category pages, probably fixing links *to* the category pages, fixing some of the broken HTML, and maybe a couple of other small issues that I've forgotten.

On the GitHub side, I don't have a firm plan, yet.  I imagine that I'll go back to a project that I've neglected...but also, don't act surprised when I create a new project or two, because I've had that "itch."
