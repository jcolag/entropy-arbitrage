## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Phantasms

Since last time, the crew over on **DS9** deals with a thorny Child Protective Services call in *Cardassians*.

Meanwhile, strap in for another give-Data-all-the-screen-time episode of self-indulgent dream-stuff. At least this time, we don't need to endure the usual goofy voices...

 > **PICARD**: I've managed to avoid it for the past six years, but now it would seem my luck has run out. I can't think of anything more tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation, uninteresting food, boring speeches.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Can't you think of some excuse to get out of it?

They still hate interacting with their leadership.  But I'd also point out that Picard had no issues---other than his lack of talent---giving a keynote speech at an archaeology conference in [*QPid*]({% post_url 2024-03-21-qpid %}), so he doesn't mind going to these functions if the event can revolve around him.  Although sure, I imagine that it would feel fairly awkward hanging out with admirals, given that Picard led an insurrection and killed a bunch of their peers in [*Conspiracy*]({% post_url 2022-11-03-conspiracy %}).

 > **PICARD**: After six years, Number One, I don't think I have any excuses left.

And now that I bring it up, didn't that insurrection happen a bit less than six year prior, around the last time that he went...?

 > **DATA**: I have had one hundred eleven dreams since I first discovered this program nine months ago. In all of that time, I have never experienced such strange and disturbing imagery. I believe it was a nightmare.

When used as an adjective like this, [disturbing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disturbing) generally refers to causing distress or worry.  We mean it as *emotionally* disturbing, as opposed to when we use it as a verb, where it might refer to any sort of impact.  I point this out, because I assume that the episode or season will inevitably waste our time again trying to split hairs over Data allegedly still not having emotions.

 > **DATA**: Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say I am preoccupied.

Given that *we've* spent multiple minutes on the idea already in a forty-five-minute show, one certainly might...

 > **TYLER**: Commander La Forge?

If you recognize Tyler, once the camera acknowledges her presence, actor and dancer [Gina Ravera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Ravera) plays her, this probably one of her first roles where the dancing part of her background didn't get priority.

 > **LAFORGE**: Exactly. And quite frankly, it's beginning to get a little bit uncomfortable.

Like pretty much every other man on this ship, they'll throw themselves at any woman who has the misfortune of getting too close, only to complain (or run in terror) when somebody shows the slightest interest in them.

 > **DATA**: I believe I understand. You are concerned about unintentionally hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Yeah, something like that.

Translation:  He doesn't actually care about her feelings, because nobody on this show sees women as independent creatures with their own inner lives.

 > **DATA**: I have been watching Spot sleep. In the past fifteen minutes, he has had twelve muscles spasms, which indicates he was dreaming. I have often wondered what Spot dreams about. His twitching and his rapid breathing would seem to suggest anxiety, but Spot has never seen a mouse or any other form of rodentia. He has never encountered an insect, or been chased by a canine.

I feel like creatures experience anxiety for reasons other than rodents, bugs, and dogs.  For example, Data's line strongly suggests that he hasn't bothered to expose Spot to any natural stimulus, meaning that the cat *probably* hasn't received any proper socialization, either.

Plus, look at Data's quarters.  Cats climb.  Cats hide.  Where would such things happen, in that space?  I'll tell you where, it'd happen among Data's art collection that we never see out of place, meaning that the cat probably doesn't get to play there, either.

You might argue that Data probably brings Spot to the holodeck for enrichment, but I don't buy it.  For one thing, Data outright told us that the cat has never seen any natural cohabitant, and didn't qualify it with "real" or any similar term.  For another, this show has ~~wasted so much of our time~~ sorry, *made sure that we've seen* various characters using the technology to LARP, take mini-vacations, simulate doing better at their jobs without actually putting in any effort, live out unhealthy power fantasies where they denigrate colleagues, and (not to put too fine a point on it) masturbate.  If Spot spent time there getting acquainted with fake trees or mice, we would've had an episode by now where the tree has an existential crisis or the mouse demands to marry Troi or something.

Now that I think this through, Data actually bothers me in how irresponsibly he treats his pet, or rather how the show glorifies irresponsible pet ownership.  I guarantee that, if you don't exercise your cat's instincts, and the only stimulus it really receives comes from when the ship rattles and throws the cat around, it'll have anxiety.  And we even have some evidence in [*Timescape*]({% post_url 2025-05-08-timescape %}), where it lashes out at Riker while he delivers food, which sounds a *lot* like anxiety in an animal.

I mean, I also blame Riker, because I wouldn't trust him to feed *me*, either.  But this all gives a strong impression that Data should bear a lot of the responsibility for that incident by not taking care of his cat.

 > **TROI**: Data, you shouldn't be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams. It's a natural expression of your unconscious, if you have an unconscious. I'm not really sure how your positronic brain works but if it's anything like ours, then there's part of you that's trying to express itself through your dream state. And I think you should allow yourself to experience it. As Sigmund Freud said, dreams are the royal road to the knowledge of the mind.

It feels like she deliberately overlooks how often Data has gotten taken over by some rogue programming and/or taken over the ship.  Fear seems at least *somewhat* legitimate...

And even if not, Troi seems to want to play both sides against each other, in this conversation.  On one hand, she skirts around the idea that Data might have an unconscious, and will later dismiss the expansion of his dreams as an uninteresting glitch, all to remind us that (without using the word) they won't call reactions to events *emotions*.  But at the same time, she dismisses Data's concern as some irrational---some might even say emotional---overreaction to ignore, rather than a calculated analysis by an unemotional machine.

Also worrying, with [*Frame of Mind*]({% post_url 2025-04-10-frame-mind %}), this makes the second time that Troi has directed somebody in power with a history of ignoring colleagues' boundaries, to embrace their dark side and not worry so much about consequences.

 > **TROI**: We've been trying to wake you up for the last five minutes.

I've mentioned the bizarre nosiness that we've seen in episodes like [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}), but it seems like a new level when they send *three people*, senior officers no less, to give him a wake-up call.

 > **FREUD**: Tell me more about this cake.

Speaking of wasting time on the holodeck...and [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud), too, I guess.

And incidentally, think about how damning this looks, that Data crafts a simulated psychiatrist whose theories came and went centuries ago, rather than talk to the on-staff therapist.  Our current version of this technology only uses useless LLM chatbots to provide the [illusion of care](https://theconversation.com/your-ai-therapist-is-not-your-therapist-the-dangers-of-relying-on-ai-mental-health-chatbots-225411), but since these characters refuse to accept the possibility that their computers and the characters that they create have consciousness---as we've seen gestured at since [*The Big Goodbye*]({% post_url 2022-08-04-big-goodbye %})---then I don't believe that the technology changes the argument that you *shouldn't* use AI as a therapist because it can't care about you or your progress.  And when people *do* make that choice, they do so because human therapists have similarly failed to care.

 > **NAKAMURA**: Captain. We were expecting you this morning. Is there a problem?

The admiral, as well as real-world [Clyde Kusatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Kusatsu), previously poked his head in during [*The Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %}).  At the time, people knew him more for small character work like this, whereas today, people would probably recognize him more as the first (elected) SAG-AFTRA president in Los Angeles, holding that for eight years until **Picard** star Michelle Hurd took the position in 2021.

 > **TROI**: Data, if you were one of my human patients, I might be concerned right now. I'd say you had a waking dream or a hallucination. But you're not human. I think we might be looking at some kind of technological problem.

Except, he definitely *did* have a hallucination, no?  Yes, [a sensory perception of something that does not exist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallucination), plus some probabilistic caveats about when they might show up and why.  Does she dismiss his experiences on the basis that...OK, yeah, that sounds exactly like how these people work.  Well, at least she'll need to deal with consequences from that terrible choice in a few scenes.

 > **TROI**: And Data? Next time, see me before you see Sigmund.

I'd like to point out, for the record, that while neither of them had anything useful to say, or even really tried to help him, only one of the two accepted Data's experiences as he described them instead of waving them off as somebody else's problem, nor did that one object to getting a second opinion.  Like I said earlier, the choice of a holographic therapist seems damning.

 > **LAFORGE**: Good work, Tyler. I thought he'd never leave. Data, I want you to give me a hand locking down this plasma conduit. Data? Data?

It looks like they don't actually have much respect for Picard, despite all the brown-nosing that we've seen.

 > **WORF**: It is screeching, pounding, dissonance. It is not music.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Worf, it's better than music, it's jazz.

First, funny joke, and actually a decent delivery.

Second, though, I have trouble understanding Worf's characterization of jazz.  But the line kept nagging at me, so I decided to experiment a bit.

Let's take 1930s (as if another decade could ever exist in this show's context) jazz standard [*All the Things You Are*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Things_You_Are).  I happen to have an album with the track on it---**Jerome Kern: Life Upon the Wicked Stage**, if that information seems important to you---and I...actually have trouble imagining a "smoother" song, though that necessarily has a lot to do with the choices made by the singer(s) and band.

Worf doesn't have a human head, though, so we really need to ask whether we can *make* the song sound screeching, pounding, and dissonant.  And while I won't subject you to the results, both for copyright and pain-tolerance reasons, I loaded the track up in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and ran a fairly narrow [band-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter) along the central frequencies---muting the high and low frequencies---then spread the frequencies back out from that narrow band with the remaining information.  And as a result, the new high-frequency sounds now felt much harsher, the new low-frequency sounds, and...yes, I'd call it dissonant, too.

I don't think that the writers *intended* to tell us that Klingon hearing doesn't have the range that ours does, since I don't think that it ever comes up again.  And it has nothing to do with our project, here, at least not directly.  But this calls into question Worf's day-to-day audio experience.  If he does have a narrower range of hearing instead of an extremely specific definition of music, then his colleagues, the computer, and the alarms probably all have similar grating profiles.  He might not even hear some important things in his environment.

 > **DATA**: No, sir. I saw a straw coming out of your head.

Does it bother anybody else that Data doesn't specify a *drinking* straw, rather than dried cereal stalks that we presumably made early drinking straws from?  I don't think that we've seen anybody use a drinking straw in the franchise before the dream, but we know that some people have at least visited farms, and this feels like one of the few places where Data's pedantry would help.

 > **WORF**: Commander. I will have to confiscate your sidearm.

Why does he even *have* one available for confiscation?

 > **DATA**: Unlike a canine, Spot does not respond to verbal commands. Goodbye, Spot. He will need to be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement number twenty-five.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **DATA**: And he will require water. And you must provide him with a sandbox. And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat, and a good cat.

Wow, Data really does seem like a terrible caregiver.  Cats do respond to verbal commands---even if they favor visual cues---but more like a person than a dog, they probably won't bother if it feels like you only want to boss them around.  And closely related, notice how Data prioritizes communicating his feelings for the cat over literally anything that the cat care about.

Also, "provide him" with a litter box?  He doesn't leave one out and clean it regularly?  One more reason for the cat to have anxiety...

 > **PICARD**: Perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpreting the symbols and images of your dreams.

Surely, they'd find it more important to understand how Data detects them and what that detection tells them, so that they can try to communicate directly.  No?  This episode exists as a one-performer show and everybody else watches?  Gotcha...

 > **CRUSHER**: It's working, Captain.

It sounds suspiciously like they had a chance to communicate with these novel creatures and, once again, jumped to extermination.

 > **DATA**: Enter.

This scene---though not any line---in fact, confirms that Spot doesn't get the right kind of socialization and entertainment.  Cats will "play" like Data has Spot if you don't give them anything better, but in human terms, it provides stimulation along the lines of watching a travel video.  It *hints* at the desired activity, but limits your participation to a small space and ignores most aspects of a real vacation.  Or imagine playing fetch with a dog, but you use a toy that doesn't bounce and drop it on the table instead of throwing it; the dog *can* participate, and might even give it a couple of tries, but nobody would see that as viable stimulation.

In short, no prey hovers conveniently above a cat's face.  Turn down the lights and move the toy *like something to hunt* would move.  This nonsense feels like the other extreme from using laser pointers, which do start out as fun, but eventually frustrate the cat because they can never catch their target.

## Conclusions

I expected a fluff episode, but people really made their cultural views clear...and I apparently needed to explain cats.

### The Bad

Despite, or maybe causally related to, the strict hierarchies that we see, people don't have much respect for or interest in spending time with their leaders, seeing them mostly as obstacles.

Though they use softer language, everybody continues to insist that androids have no emotions, even while they describe their emotional responses.  Their therapist even goes out of her way to dismiss Data's experience.  But if he does have emotions, they think that he should ignore them.  Their version of therapy, in fact, seems to have swung back to thoroughly toxic.  Beyond dismissing Data's emotions, she encourages him to embrace the darkness in his artificial personality.  Probably because of that, at least some people find uncaring AI simulations more trustworthy.

We again see that the same men who push themselves romantically on women almost indiscriminately suddenly balk when a woman shows an interest in them, with suggestions that they see the women as means to an end, rather than peers.

The cat has a terrible environment for a cat to live, but nobody seems to care, suggesting that people mostly treat pets disposably.

People still have no effective privacy, with someone minutes late for work leading to search parties hovering over a late sleeper.

The episode provides us with another (likely) reminder that they build their technology and environments for humans with no disabilities, here focusing briefly on the experience that certain non-humans have of audio.

People keep sidearms in their quarters.  And, in fact, the entire episode hinges on detecting novel aliens with possible intelligence, and choosing to exterminate them instead of trying to communicate.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in seven days, when we pretend to care about Troi's childhood in *Dark Page*...
