As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Anecdotally, I can add that I often think of my childhood marked primarily by a massively improved environment.  We had smog.  We had brown, foamy water at every beach.  You could *smell* when traffic started building up.  And I assume that, by next year, RFK Jr. will recommend that children snort a combination of lead an asbestos off a dirty toilet seat or something.

> Bernays led the marketing pivot to allure. Chevrolet’s 1950s “See the USA in Your Chevrolet” campaign painted cars as portals to adventure and family memories. Manufacturers introduced annual model updates, rendering last year’s ride obsolete, a strategy Bernays tested for GM after Henry Ford dismissed it as sleazy.

I can't help noticing that this kind of marketing has since gone almost entirely toward selling us on ignoring looming crises---including those caused by car culture---while companies now shout at us about how either we buy their product or get left behind...

> When popular messaging, like on social media, and organizational interventions misunderstand the causes of people’s inaction, they risk exacerbating frustration and tensions. Interventions need to account for their audience’s true perspectives on what makes allyship difficult.

This tracks, in my experience.  In a "classical" workplace, people quickly get the impression that their opinions don't matter and that the power get cut more slack than everybody else.  If it feels like the options begin at nobody paying attention and end at retribution---in many cases, reporting harassment gets the *victim* reassigned somewhere irrelevant to minimize the chance of contact with the (more powerful) offender---then it becomes a matter of choosing battles.

To go a bit beyond the boundaries of the article, over the years, I have found two ways of building the motivation to push past that.  First, when you have some formal or informal authority, get used to the flat phrase "we don't do that here."  It minimizes the feeling of judgment, and it doesn't expose anybody to much risk.  This often works well in smaller communities online, where anybody with some history in the group can get away with making an observation about the group dynamics.

For people who feel like they have less of a right to get involved, embrace your disbelief and disgust.  In a lot of cases, you can get a lot of mileage out of the slow head-shake when the offender looks to you for a reaction.

I dislike the framing in there that Congress needs more interparty collaboration, when only one party ever gets criticized for it, but...I actually stopped reading The 19th soon after their launch, because they had fawning, softball interviews with female Republican operatives, justifying it as not believing in partisan politics, only gender issues.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

> The U.S. Constitution imposes no citizenship requirement when it comes to voting. The original text of the Constitution, in fact, said very little about the right to vote. It was not until legislators passed subsequent amendments, starting after the Civil War up through the 1970s, that the Constitution even explicitly prohibited voting laws that discriminate on account of race, sex or age.

Related to this topic (and also woven throughout the article), can we retire the "some experts say that this move might do the thing that the politicians behind it said that they wanted it to do"?

> For example, in the wild, young female chimpanzees have been observed carrying and playing with sticks, holding them like mothers would hold their infants. And a chimpanzee in captivity seemed to drag imaginary blocks along the floor after playing with real wooden blocks.

I have to assume that most animals have some imagination, but they don't have the physical capacity to do anything with that imagination.  I mean, a cat pretending to give you something, for example, only looks like a cat walking up to you and briefly opening its mouth.  Consider play-fighting, which requires the artifice of catching prey or defending itself, while also acknowledging boundaries.

> U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi picked Albus and has [granted him special authority](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/bondi-hands-st-louis-prosecutor-nationwide-election-fraud-remit) to handle election-related cases nationwide, even though his earlier work as a federal prosecutor didn’t involve election law or election-related cases. The meetings with Martin, Olsen and other lawyers for the Justice Department were described by the source as being about “election integrity,” a term the Trump administration has used to describe investigations into its false claims that elections are rigged.

Not only can they not get over their massive loss six years ago, they need to scramble to cheat, because every loss from here brings them all closer to arrests.  And you'll notice that, even though the Supreme Court has tried to insulate Trump from accountability, even they wouldn't dare to suggest that all the petty crooks around him have any kind of immunity.
