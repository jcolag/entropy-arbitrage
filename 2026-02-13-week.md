As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

> When you use AI, even though you might tell yourself you’re just being efficient, you can probably recognize, deep down, that you’re misleading the recipient about the personal effort and thought that went into the message.

Hashtags:  #AI #Guilt #Writing

And add that to all the other reasons to avoid these inane chatbots.  But honestly, if you value "efficiency" in your personal correspondence, maybe rethink those relationships...

> Some of the tech names in the files have long been associated with Epstein; Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has been the subject of Epstein rumors and reporting for years. Other Epstein correspondents, like Elon Musk, had less of an established connection before Friday’s release.

Hashtags:  #Epstein #Tech

It doesn't remotely surprise me that the people who made billions exploiting people knew the guy who used his billions to exploit people.

Some readers might want to check out [EpsteIn](https://github.com/cfinke/EpsteIn), which takes the export of your LinkedIn data and searches your connections for matches in the Epstein files, so that you can get far away.  For the record, I only found one possibility in mind, but someone with such a common name that I wouldn't consider it a sign of anything...and I don't think that I'll ask.

It sounds like the data in the study ends *before* the Trump administration started trying to destroy global healthcare, too.  What a mess...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/116053073083724775)

> The secrets of slavery are concealed like those of the Inquisition. My master was, to my knowledge, the father of eleven slaves. But did the mothers dare to tell who was the father of their children? Did the other slaves dare to allude to it, except in whispers among themselves? No, indeed! They knew too well the terrible consequences.

Honestly, this almost seems quaint, given how many times the administration had cut funding entirely because facts disagree with their bigoted wishes.

> Technology itself is not the main problem; lack of awareness and accountability is. When workers understand how these systems work and insist on correct data, the same technology can become a tool for protection.

Knowing what I know about how programmers operate, rarely considering the possibility that other people don't live *exactly* like we do, applying the results of that to immigrant populations already feels like a disaster.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Women have been mapping the world for centuries – and now they’re speaking up for the people left out of those maps](https://theconversation.com/women-have-been-mapping-the-world-for-centuries-and-now-theyre-speaking-up-for-the-people-left-out-of-those-maps-272757) from The Conversation @TheConversationUS@newsie.social

> For example, women are [disproportionately affected by disasters](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004377), including through a heightened risk of experiencing gender-based violence. Geographic analyses reveal a [persistent gender gap in datasets](https://odihpn.org/en/publication/representation-in-mapping-ensuring-impact-with-women-behind-the-data/), which often lack information on women’s health and daily needs, reproductive services or child care centers.

I feel like "long overdue" seems like a massive understatement, but as long as you read the article, let's go with it...

> Just as Wikipedia forever transformed access to knowledge, Wikivoyage has the opportunity to do the same with the way we plan our trips: through collaboration, shared experiences and free content, far removed from commercial interests and soulless automatisms.

I haven't used Wikivoyage in a long time---not that I travel much---but checking areas that I know well near me, it seems...uneven.  One fairly touristy town barely has anything listed.  Another area seems about a decade out of date.  And a third rambles for a paragraph about needing to watch out for South American gangs and illegal immigration after dark, warning travelers to not disrespect the locals.  I like the idea, but wow...
