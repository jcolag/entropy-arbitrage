![A lemur looking off to the left](/blog/assets/Coquerels-sifaka-head.png "Looking back...")

As I've tried to do on the last Sunday of every year that I've published **Entropy Arbitrage**, I wanted to take at least *one* post to look back on what the year looked like from my weird space, and maybe pat myself on the back over projects that I managed to pull together and release since the beginning of the year.  I mostly base the format on the [previous end-of-year posts](/blog/tag/new-year), though it does change a bit from year to year.

For those of you who read the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee/jcolag), the format should look similar, with thoughts that don't feel sufficiently fleshed out to warrant their own post, but too complex or wordy to fit into a social media post.

## Culture

{% cw Due to the density of links in various sections, I won't bother to annotate the licensing at the other end.  Presume that the authors have *not* made their work available under Free Culture licenses. %}

This year, I noticed a few interesting things about how people consume and process politics and popular culture.

### The Uprising Begins

Last year, my flagship observation involved people expressing widespread outrage at corporate abuse, only to continue happily [giving those same companies their time and money]({% post_url 2023-12-31-review-2023 %}#at-least-the-trains-run-on-time).  This year, that *may* have started to change.

At least from what I can tell, it seems to have started with the big newspapers.  **The New York Times** seems to have finally angered people enough that---combined with the [tech guild strike](https://cwa-union.org/news/new-york-times-tech-guild-ends-strike-continues-contract-fight) that had a resolution coming with some [obnoxious caveats](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301557/new-york-times-connections-creator-take-down)---people not only complained about the paper's coverage, but *also* stopped patting themselves on the back for their game-only subscriptions or sharing "gift links."  Likewise, [Jeff Bezos scuttling the **Washington Post**'s endorsement of Kamala Harris](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-endorsements) and clumsily defending the decision has led to [mass cancellations of subscriptions](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations), with many also [turning away from Amazon itself](https://slate.com/business/2024/10/washington-post-endorsement-election-cancel-jeff-bezos.html).

Meanwhile, even more abruptly, people somehow *finally* managed to realize that {% x %} has "become" an open sewage pipe of right-wing content, rather than the romanticized image of Twitter that white people who only follow other white people remember from a decade ago.  And this time, they've *fled* the platform, instead of finding a new excuse to stay, settling in on combinations of Bluesky and the Fediverse.  Maybe more importantly, it also sounds like the people who left Twitter almost two years ago have already started looking for Bluesky's escape hatch, due to their [failure to deal with Jesse Singal](https://www.advocate.com/business/bluesky-jesse-singal) and other "just asking questions" hate-mongers.

Add in the low-level backlash against Internet companies cramming shoddy generative AI tools into every product, including [making search worse](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/google-gemini/google-ai-overview-controversy-why-theres-a-big-backlash), and it looks like we could finally see a rejection of giant corporations...if we capitalize on the momentum.

And sure, this change certainly took long enough.  Since last year's end-of-year post and before people started avoiding bad companies, we had a [monkey rebellion](https://www.fastcompany.com/91225467/escaped-monkeys-update-alpha-genesis-research-facility-did-they-catch) and a [robot labor strike](https://www.odditycentral.com/news/robot-manufacturer-has-12-robots-kidnapped-from-showroom-by-another-robot.html), with people shrugging off a [healthcare CEO murder](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/what-the-murder-of-the-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-means-to-america) as maybe less violent than depriving people of live-saving care along the way.  But people got there eventually.

Yeah, we could've stood in solidarity with renegade monkeys and robots.  But no, you all needed to explain that you'd "always call it Twitter" and "can't cede ground" on a platform purchased by a drug-addled weirdo who misses Apartheid.  Sit with that for a while you *now* lecture people on finding better outlets from your [newsletter on Substack](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/03/substack-user-revolt-anti-censorship-stance-neo-nazis)...

### Press Opera

Related to the previous section, while we've always had the distinction on some level, it feels like 2024 really served to underscore the difference between real journalism---investigative work that speaks truth to power---and transcribing whatever powerful people tell them to print, at least in the United States.  This year, it feels like outlets really made sure to inform readers which side of that divide that they'd rather stand on, and most didn't choose journalism.

Corporate media, in particular, seemed to go out of its way to prove its fealty to right-wing extremists.  While certain journalists at least *tried* to do their jobs of reporting facts, most corporate-run outlets took every minor lapse as an opportunity to attack Biden---on his age, on imaginary illnesses, or on hypothetical policy choices---and completely ignoring Harris, while almost fabricating better campaign speeches for Trump, as they quietly elided the racism and ignorance and spun the rest into wishful versions of what they think he meant to say.

This has continued.  Disney decided to [settle Trump's doomed-to-fail lawsuit against ABC](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/14/nx-s1-5229089/abc-e-jean-carroll-trump-george-stephanopoulos).  MSNBC openly wants to [cozy up to Trump](https://apnews.com/article/morning-joe-trump-meeting-ring-cf4816dd28372a4c942d256df2e440ae), while CNN, despite some occasional push-back, happily hosted their [uncritical town hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Republican_Town_Hall_with_Donald_Trump)-style meeting.  I already mentioned **The New York Times** and **Washington Post** fiascos in the previous section, but the **Los Angeles Times** also [pulled their Harris endorsement](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-28/non-endorsement-post-la-times-cancellations), and unlike Jeff Bezos trying to claim the moral high ground, LA's team seems to have opted for threats, based on what I see in that last link.

 > ...even disappointed readers needed to stand fast or risk having to rely on the less probing coverage provided by thinly staffed suburban newspapers around Southern California.

Tolerate unethical business practices, or take your chances with local news that we could bankrupt or buy out at any moment?

Even before that, **NYT** [spun their own conspiracy theory about Biden maybe secretly having Parkinson's Disease](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/parkinsons-expert-white-house.html) while not caring about Trump's medical records after two alleged assassination attempts.  Oh, and RFK, Jr., explaining his plan to [send people with psychiatric medication prescriptions to labor camps](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-wants-to-send-people-on-antidepressants-to-government-wellness-farms/) barely made it to the news.  But I kept expecting headlines like *Biden Drops out; How This Will Be Bad for Biden*, because everybody in the field seemed to love that concept.

#### A Possible Better Way

Taking this in a different direction, the more that I think about it, the more I agree with Ryan Cooper's [idea for fighting the propaganda war](https://prospect.org/politics/2024-12-12-democrats-lost-propaganda-war/), that rather than search for a silver bullet while conducting business as usual---the inane "center-left Joe Rogan" plan---stop advertising and create (or buy) newspapers, news channels, and other ways to get *facts* into the hands of people who need them.  Remember, after all, that Republicans started looking at a version of [Fox News during the Nixon administration](https://web.archive.org/web/20190330061638/https://gawker.com/5814150/roger-ailes-secret-nixon-era-blueprint-for-fox-news) to guide uncritical viewers through GOP fact-averse viewpoints, and [built it on a tabloid model](https://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/the_birth_of_fox_news/) to attract eyeballs.  Oh, and by the way, it turns out that [attractive news anchors reduce comprehension and retention](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2011/01/27/study-sexy-news-anchors-fox-news-megyn-kelly-laura-berman/) of the actual news, if you've ever wondered.  But---as they say---I digress.

Back on track, we don't need "a Joe Rogan," not least because that plan will ultimately and inevitably backfire.  We need somebody---ideally, the Democratic Party, because they have the money and motivation to not close up shop when they realize that they can't turn a profit---to pay bunches of those unemployed and under-employed journalists to do what they do best, to fill news deserts and educate the population.

What if those journalists uncover scandals about Democrats?  That seems like a bonus, since the party tends to frown on electing felons, [unlike the competition](https://theconversation.com/trumps-criminal-conviction-wont-stop-him-from-getting-security-clearance-as-president-243104).

And that somewhat reminds me of one of my favorite lines from Pulpy (and public domain) science fiction, which I've surely mentioned before:

 > If you have a few problems, you have trouble, but if you have a whole lot of problems, they start solving each other.

H. Beam Piper wrote that in [*Ministry...of Disturbance*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20659), as the kindly galactic emperor works out how to overthrow his stagnant regime and turn his empire towards peace, by playing factions and cranks against each other over the course of his life.  Whatever the fictional plot, we have many problems.  The not-fascists can't figure out how to make their cases to people.  Increasing areas of the country have no local news, and the rest of us have too little investigative journalism.  Journalists can't afford to stay in their careers.  The political party that has the least interest in facts has the easiest time laundering their stories through [view from nowhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalistic_objectivity#View_from_nowhere) media.  I've probably overlooked some others, but regardless, I can't help notice how well-suited these problems seem suited to solving each other, so maybe we should try it, so that we don't need to rely on outlets that would rather have a good seat in the [Brady Press Briefing Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._Brady_Press_Briefing_Room) than call out dishonesty.

#### Institutions versus Individuals

You might ask why I suggest funding by a political organization, rather than subscriptions or donations.

While I don't object at all to subscribing to independent media, relying on it makes journalism a popularity contest, and that frequently favors people who "report on" other people's journalism rather than performing their own investigations, because they get to focus on the polish and outreach.  In a lot of ways, the subscription model reverts this discussion back to the idea of finding "another Joe Rogan," rather than solving actual problems, by imagining that we can solve this with a famous face.

Maybe related, it also places the burden on people who can't afford to pay it.  We can't have a news ecosystem where every economic downturn risks a collapse, because we can already see how well that works.  We certainly can't revitalize news deserts by telling the people who live there to pony up for each journalist's newsletter, which *might* deliver more useful information than [OAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network) or other options, but also totally might not.  And if the independent journalist can't get enough patrons, then they need to get a different job.

Lastly, individual patrons almost certainly means individual journalists, which wastes money on duplicate overhead between journalists and an added burden of *finding* the decent journalists in the area.

By contrast, if a political party funds the services, then you can have well-staffed newsrooms that can make the case to the community for joining the audience.

## Technology

Most of my day, as you can probably guess, involves some aspect of a computer.  And yet, I don't have much to say about it---I haven't had the time to learn anything distinctly new or notice any major changes in what I use---except for one significant update that has come up on the blog before.

### Hardware

I can't think of any new or interesting hardware in my life, this year, other than [buying a cheap 3D printer]({% post_url 2024-07-22-ratcatcher %}) over the summer.  I haven't used it in a couple of months, since with windows closed, it means that I need to breathe whatever comes off it.  But other than that, I've had fun playing with 3D models.

### Software

Similar to the hardware section above, in terms of learning new software, I have spent most of my time looking at 3D modeling.  I genuinely love working with [Open SCAD](https://openscad.org/).  [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), I haven't quite figured them out, for my use cases, but I at least understand them a bit better, now.  And I anticipate getting a lot more use out of [Make Human](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/), once I figure out how to get the models into a form that I can manipulate in Open SCAD.

## Releases

While I mess around with a lot of projects, much to my dismay, I haven't released any significant projects, this year.  I lost momentum on **The Light's Edge**, so even there, I don't know whether to try to push out the first installment in this final week of the year, or wait until January.

### Un-Releases

In "un-releases," it may have happened earlier and I forgot, but I believe that I decided to shutter [**All Around the News**]({% post_url 2021-04-25-aatn %}).  It got almost no traffic, except from the media outlets whose work I used either praising me or complaining that I didn't propagate their tracking pixels.  Even among the legitimate traffic, nobody clicked on the links to donate to the outlets.  And at that point, it seemed clear that the experiment failed, and "build a Free Culture media outlet" wouldn't work, at least not with me behind it.

If you need something similar, I'd recommend using [Open Newswire](https://www.opennewswire.org/) to find Free Culture (or similar) sources, and add those that you like to your favorite RSS feed reader.

### On the Other Hand

Depending on how much you want to stretch things, I suppose that I *could* legitimately identify my [Post.News archive](https://jcolag.github.io/post.news/) and my [conversion script](https://github.com/jcolag/depost), [Cohost archive](https://jcolag.github.io/cohost/) and my [conversion script](https://github.com/jcolag/cohost-export), early [prototype toys](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/lights-edge-toys) for **The Light's Edge**, and an attempt to [archive the Fictopedia project](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/).  Maybe even [Thorough](https://github.com/jcolag/jsonresume-theme-thorough), my [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) theme counts, since I formally [published it on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-thorough).  Oh, and [Earburn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/earburn/), published on Mozilla's add-on site.

In other words, I suppose that I did release a bunch of things, but no projects big enough that warranted a big announcement of the release.  And by the way, that sort of realization contributes to *why* I write these year-in-review posts.  As somebody who doesn't really think in terms of "accomplishments," I can quickly overlook things that I managed to do, and instead grow annoyed at the things that I didn't.

### Sunday Rants

This year, I've written about a fair range of topics, some recurring.

 * I wrote quite a bit about the Free Culture movement, suggesting that we find [ways to diversify]({% post_url 2024-01-14-diversify %}) what outsiders see, indicating the lack of [people willing to adapt works cheaply]({% post_url 2024-05-26-corman %}), outlined the [history and possible future of the movement]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}), illustrated how [Free Culture news](2024-06-09-free-culture-news) might look, and dug into the [problems with "open source characters"]({% post_url 2024-08-11-open-source-characters %}).
 * AI also got some attention from me, this year, including posts on my experience with [ChatGPT's paid tier]({% post_url 2024-01-21-paid-ai %}), the [smoke-and-mirrors nature of the products]({% post_url 2024-02-25-ai-doom %}), and the [problems with licenses that single out language models]({% post_url 2024-03-03-ai-licenses %}).
 * Because of the escalating stakes, I dipped into politics, including talking about the [use of the word *weird*]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %}), thoughts on [before the 2024 US Presidential election]({% post_url 2024-10-27-project-2025 %}), and the [election aftermath]({% post_url 2024-11-10-election %}).
 * I put together some not-quite-advice on [moving to Linux]({% post_url 2024-02-18-linux %}), [sleeping]({% post_url 2024-07-14-sleep-2 %}), and [making the Fediverse a viable social media home]({% post_url 2024-10-20-most-mastodon %}).  A list of the [blogs that I follow]({% post_url 2024-11-17-blogs %}) and why I follow them probably also loosely fits this recommendation-style grouping.

Topics also varied quite a bit, including the following.

 * A rundown of the goofy [e-mail that I get from people who want me to publish them]({% post_url 2024-02-11-sure %}).
 * The general [inanity of chivalry]({% post_url 2024-03-17-chivalry %}), a story that includes horses, satirical novels, racism's equivalent of Trekkies, superheroes, and more.
 * The troubling [shady operations of the Internet Archive]({% post_url 2024-09-08-internet-archive %}).
 * A celebration of [five years publishing this blog]({% post_url 2024-12-08-five-years %}).
 * An analysis of the silly idea that [revisionist films about villains]({% post_url 2024-12-15-devils-detail %}) lead to supporting fascism.
 * In the middle of everything else, I also posted about a [variety of then-current events]({% post_url 2024-04-07-grab-bag %}), along with a digression about the surprising number of people actively gunning for the end of the world, so that the next world---however it arises---might finally put their sorry rumps in charge.

It looks like this year had the most Sunday posts since 2021, by the way.  I don't know if I understand the value of that data-point, but I appreciate it...

### Fiction

I managed to publish three short stories, this year.  [*'Neath a Sunless Sky*]({% post_url 2024-04-14-sunless-sky %}) riffed on the earthquake and eclipse that passed near my neighborhood in rapid succession.  [*Please Come Back...*]({% post_url 2024-06-23-customer-retention %}) imagines a streaming service with a maybe-unhealthy attachment to customers.  And [*Chosen*]({% post_url 2024-09-15-chosen %}) recounts an epilogue to fit any number of adventure stories, lecturing the prophesized savior on consent and social justice.

And last week, while I didn't write it, I at least chose and provided [*Christmas Every Day*]({% post_url 2024-12-22-christmas-every-day %}) for a "holiday reading."

### Entropy Arbitrage

The big headline on the blog itself for 2024 probably deals with my ongoing goal to make the blog more usable.  As some examples, I've added the following features.

 * The blog now supports [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), allowing other blogs to interact with my posts in ways that resemble social media, but owning their own data.
 * Posts marked as connecting to other posts in some way now have bidirectional links between the posts, instead of only pushing readers forward.
 * Every post---assuming that I don't forget to add the code for it---now has a table of contents, which (with JavaScript enabled) shows your current location in the post.
 * When reading on the web, off-site links now broadly indicate where the link goes.  Similarly, code snippets identify the programming language used.
 * Most images now get delivered [AV1 Image File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF), drastically speeding up page-load times.
 * Posts now include a share-to-Mastodon box.
 * The blog finally has a dark mode, for the people who'd rather not deal with brighter screens.
 * Tags can now include hyphens and have descriptions to explain the types of posts that they cover.
 * Posts now have better Open Graph metadata, meaning that posting links on social media will generally produce better previews.
 * Post tags appear on index pages.
 * Unreleased, but the blog now has most of a mechanism for saving pages to read or comment on later.

I've made other small changes along the way, but I suspect that these should make the biggest difference, going forward.

And as you know, the blog celebrated its [fifth anniversary]({% post_url 2024-12-08-five-years %}) earlier this month, along with over twelve hundred posts containing about two and a quarter million words.  Whew...

## Personal

Finally, I've learned a thing or two about myself, I think.

### Cord-Cutting After-Effects (Still) Continue

As I have predicted for a while, canceling my cable television subscription has continued to have ripple-effects as I cancel more.  Shortly after, I canceled Netflix and Amazon Prime.  This year, I let Hulu, Disney+, and Paramount+ lapse, though I still have another couple of weeks on the last.  Oh, and since I haven't really had the time for many films, especially when they predominantly show documentaries, I haven't renewed Ovid, though I expect to change that eventually.

For the record, that means that I now only have Peacock, and that primarily because another service pays for it.  I'll probably pick up an occasional month of different services, when they've amassed enough shows that I definitely want to watch.  Otherwise, though, I expect to spend more time on the library-sponsored services---Hoopla and Kanopy---and various ad-supported services.  Oh, and my home media server, which might sometimes overlap with the ad-supported thing, for [reasons](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) that I probably don't want to detail...

To give you an idea of how little I expect this change to affect me, I pulled down the 2024 issues of the aforementioned **Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter and counted up where I got TV shows, films, and so forth.  Non-video includes twenty-five books completed and three podcasts either listened to completion or abandoned.  For video, I see one thing[^2] watched on Tubi, five on Hulu, five on Paramount+, five on Peacock, eight on Amazon Prime or Freevee (the URLs don't make it apparent), nine on Hoopla, nineteen on Disney+ (at least one of which they made available on YouTube as well), and thirty-six on Kanopy.  In other words, I already watch significantly more on the library-funded apps---and spend even more time on them, if we include books---than I do across all the paid services.

[^2]:  By "thing," in this case, I mean some contained narrative product, either a (probably feature-length) film or as much of a television series as the service had available, mostly the same criteria that I use for the newsletter media discussions.

If, with only free options and physical media through my local server plus maybe Ovid, I somehow need even more to watch, then I'll probably finally donate to my local PBS station for a [Passport](https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/5000692392-what-is-pbs-passport-) subscription, since public television deserves support, if only for producing shows that wouldn't survive on ad-supported television.

### Social Media Changes

I didn't have much to say about the state of social media last year, but [2022 saw the Twitter upheaval]({% post_url 2022-12-25-review-2022 %}#social-media-changes), and this year feels like it had the biggest changes for me since then.

As I alluded to under the section above on things that I released in 2024, Post.News and Cohost both ceased operations.  While I never expected either to last---they both had a moderation overhead that neither team could afford to pay *and* no real way to generate revenue[^1]---losing Cohost in particular hurt, because it created such an interesting and fun community.  I miss Post less, because the community felt more homogenous, but it also had some potential.

[^1]: I still respect Cohost's *intent* to fund itself by allowing people to advertise and sell sexually explicit content, but that always felt doomed to failure, because credit card processors and banks don't want the overhead of policing those transactions for abuse.  To make this work, you'd need an entire separate financial regime with enough lawyers to go to court as laws change to make certain uses uncomfortable, and they didn't have that.

Meanwhile, I have since added an [account on Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/@jcolag), another small and centralized---but Free Software---social network.  The majority of the community comes from the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) community, which I know nothing about, but they mostly seem nice enough over there and want more diversity.

### A Need for Community, Maybe

I didn't mention when I released the aforementioned five-year retrospective post---though I alluded to it in talking about wishing that blogs could grow closer to community spaces---in looking at many old posts, it seems that a lack of constructive community comes up frequently.  Institutions seem to see us as little more than a renewable resource to parrot their talking points online and set up a monthly donation, but don't you even *think* of getting involved in their policies, and don't dare criticize their leaders.  Social media exists, but you only have choices between a difficult-to-navigate Fediverse, small corporate offerings (see the previous section) that probably won't survive for more than two years, and large corporate offerings that want you in a constant state of anxiety so that you'll make other people anxious and maybe accidentally click on some ads.

And yet, we have many brilliant people out here with free time---enough free time to create Free Culture works, in fact---and a massive need to coordinate efforts to solve problems.  By "problems," I should say, I mean a wide variety of things to do.  Political agitation, license advocacy, getting important works in front of audiences, *developing* important works, and more should happen.  But by framing all these movements as individualistic projects, we probably won't see them happen until the framing changes.

That framing seems critical, because most of the issues at stake deal with sharing, collaboration, and expression, and coming together to make things or enabling people to do so.  And that all feels like it warrants a far different structure than a centralized fund-raising organization.

Meanwhile, we've never had easier ways to communicate with people, but as mentioned, you either have awful corporate overlords who see you as unpaid labor, nicer corporate overlords who *probably* won't actually outlive a pet hamster for various reasons, or a massive discovery problem.  Sometimes, you have all three options at once.  If you have a particular interest, you have no idea if the enclave that you might find---on Matrix, Discord, a forum, a social media hashtag, or wherever---actually represents the community that you want or only the people who couldn't find the group that you *want* to talk to.

I don't have solutions for any of this, but I want to start thinking about it more, next year, because maybe I need it as much as the causes do.  And I hope---because it seriously defeats the purpose if I try to figure out how to make these movements look more like communities *on my own*---that you'll all join me.  Especially if you made it this far down the post (and didn't come down here looking for the link to the original lemur picture), I have to assume that you care about these issues, too.

### Hobby Time

I have already fallen off the discipline, because this time of year distracts me with holidays *and* a bunch of posts that I want to get out, but I did return for to practicing [stenography]({% post_url 2021-11-28-steno %}) for a while, and I appreciated how much I remember from my last go-around.  My fingers need the practice to get where they need to go, but I at least have a viable image of *most* of the keyboard floating around in my head.

In addition, I have two sewing projects cut and ready for whenever I have the time and energy to haul the sewing machine into the area where I use my laptop...and then re-learn how to thread it.  The first project qualifies as extremely utilitarian, and the other will get attached to **The Light's Edge**, to give you a quick preview of next year.

Expect those, and maybe some drawing, to show up in the new year.  Maybe some music, too, but don't hold your breath on that one...

## Conclusions

In most years' end-of-year posts, I say something like the following.

 > Growth takes affirmative effort, rarely happening on its own, whereas it feels surprisingly comfortable to neglect yourself into bad habits.

I still stand by that sentiment, though I needed to update the shoddy diction from the first few times around...

Enough about me, though...well, at least until tomorrow's [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) post and then next Sunday's look ahead at 2025.  How did *your* 2024 go?
