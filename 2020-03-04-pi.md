*B-but wait, John, Pi Day isn't for another week and a half, yet!*

![Pi](/blog/assets/computer-technology-car-vintage-retro-number-753544-pxhere.com.jpg "Mechanical Calculator Pi")

Far worse than arguments over lunar holidays is that everybody gets [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) wrong.  They're all lying to you.  It's *tomorrow*.  You can trust me, though.

Why is March 5th correct and March 14th is allegedly wrong?  Because this is about *math*.  If we accept that the whole number three (3) is counting months to give us March, then we have an irrational number left over, 0.141592654...

Sure, we *could* read digits and pretend that they represent days to pull off fourteen, but there's a few problems with that.

 * This is inconsistent with the interpretation of whole numbers.
 * If fourteen (14) is legitimate, then why isn't one (1) correct, instead?
 * The answer relies on representing π as a decimal fraction; that is, a base-10 number where the fractional part is represented as the numerator out of some 10<sup>n</sup>.
 * The remainder much past the day isn't very useful.  Fifteen (15) could conceivably be 3pm, but we don't have enough minutes in an hour to fit ninety-two (92), and nine (9) would be yet another rule change, so there is no such thing as "Pi Time" in this scheme.
 * If we changed the number of digits taken per position, we would unfairly skew the distribution of days/hours/minutes/seconds.

That's terrible math for a day that's about a mathematical thing, right?

So, what's the right way to do this?  If the whole number is the number of months to count, then the fractional part should be the fraction *into* that month.  So, we get...

|Remaining|Action|Result/Reason|
|----|----|----|
|3.141592654|Subtract 3|3 -> March|
|0.141592654|Multiply by 31|Days in March|
|4.389372274|Subtract 4|4 + 1 -> Day of Month, fixing zero-offset|
|0.389372274|Multiply by 24|Hours in a day|
|9.344934576|Subtract 9|9 -> 9am|
|0.344934576|Multiply by 60|Minutes in an hour|
|20.69607456|Subtract 20|20 -> 9:20am|
|0.69607456|Multiply by 60|Seconds in a minute|
|41.7644736|Subtract 41|41 -> 9:20:41am|
|0.7644736| N/A |Fraction of a second|

By this method, which is really just changing the radix of the original number (π) to a mixed-radix system, we can drill down to whatever level of precision we need, yielding March 5th, 9:20:41.7644736 am.  We have a consistent interpretation that works regardless of the radix we use to represent π to an arbitrary precision.  (See more about this, below.)

Better than that---for very niche definitions of "better"---this works for any physical constant, no matter how big or small, with only [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) and uneven distribution across the calendar requiring any subjective judgment.

In fact, let's write some code to do that for us:

```JavaScript
if (process.argv.length < 3) {
  console.error("We need a number to work this out.");
  return;
}

const arg = process.argv[2];
let n = Number(arg);

if (arg !== n.toString()) {
  console.error("The argument needs to be a number.");
  return;
}

if (n < 1 || n >= 13) {
  // We could scale the number, instead of complaining
  console.error("Until we add scaling code, the number needs to");
  console.error("be at least 1 and less than 13.");
  return;
}

let date = new Date();
// Harvest the month.
const nMonth = Math.trunc(n);
// The zeroth day of the next month is the last day of the
// previous month.
const daysInMonth = new Date(date.getYear(), nMonth, 0).getDate();

date.setMonth(nMonth - 1);
n -= nMonth;
n *= daysInMonth;

// Harvest the day.
const dayOfMonth = Math.trunc(n);

date.setDate(dayOfMonth + 1);
n -= dayOfMonth;
n *= 24;

// Harvest the hour.
const hourOfDay = Math.trunc(n);

date.setHours(hourOfDay);
n -= hourOfDay;
n *= 60;

// Harvest the minute.
const minuteOfHour = Math.trunc(n);

date.setMinutes(minuteOfHour);
n -= minuteOfHour;
n *= 60;

// Harvest the second.
const secondOfMinute = Math.trunc(n);

date.setSeconds(secondOfMinute);
n -= secondOfMinute;
console.log(date.toString());
console.log(`${n} of a second remaining.`);
```

It's mildly redundant, but refactoring---like extracting the next-most-significant number---would only make the process less clear, I think.

But now that we have code, we might as well go nuts and start creating a whole calendar, right?

I mean, if it's worth celebrating a "nerd holiday" at all (spoiler alert: it very much is not...), it's surely worth *overthinking* the holiday!  I can't believe we all missed c Day.  It was a Leap c Day, too!

Hey, why is the [plastic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_number) represented by rho (ρ)?  Ah.  In French, it's *le nombre **r**adiant*.  That makes significantly more sense.

## Bonus:  Change of Base

Now that we've done all that admittedly-weird work, we now have a much simpler algorithm to change the [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix) (or base) of numbers than is generally taught.  All those times in the code where we multiply and yank off the whole number are the key.  For integers, we need to...

 * While the number (*N*) is greater than one (or less than negative one)...
   * Divide the number *N* by the desired radix.
 * While the number *N* is between negative one and one...
   * Multiply the number *N* by the desired radix.
   * Subtract the integer part of *N* from *N*, using that as the next significant digit.

Need 1234<sub>(10)</sub> in...let's say base-7?  Repeatedly divide by 7 to get 176.285714286, 25.183673469, 3.597667638, and 0.51395252 and then start multiplying back up...

|Digit|Fraction Remaining|
|-----|-----|
|3|0.597667638|
|4|0.183673469|
|1|0.285714286|
|2|0|

So, 1234<sub>(10)</sub> = 3412<sub>(7)</sub>, in just a handful of steps!  And since it looks like this whole Pi Day rant was all just an extended joke used as a sneaky excuse to teach some fringe-use math, I guess code to do this---and figuring out how to deal with non-integer values---can be safely left as an exercise to the reader...
