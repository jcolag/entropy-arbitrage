![An owl looking off to the left, with a blurred person walking through the background](/blog/assets/20827818831_ceb6b0278a_o.png "Looking back...")

As I've tried to do on the last Sunday of every year that I've published **Entropy Arbitrage**, I wanted to take at least *one* post to look back on what the year looked like from my weird space, and maybe pat myself on the back over projects that I managed to pull together and release since the beginning of the year.  I mostly base the format on the [previous end-of-year posts](/blog/tag/new-year), though it does change a bit from year to year as I do.

For those of you who read the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), the format should look similar, with thoughts that don't feel sufficiently fleshed out to warrant their own post, but too complex or wordy to fit into a social media post.

## Culture

{% cw Due to the density of links in various sections, I won't bother to annotate the licensing at the other end.  Presume that the authors have *not* made their work available under Free Culture licenses. %}

This year, I noticed a few interesting things about how people consume and process politics and popular culture.

### Another Uprising Begins

Last year, my flagship observation involved people expressing widespread outrage at corporate abuse, and maybe finally seeing hints of finally walking away.  I don't know if that has actually happened, since I still see the defeatist "they won't notice my cancellation" attitude[^WfdvKb], but I *have* finally seen meaningful political resistance both in the United States and beyond, as people decide that maybe authoritarianism doesn't work for them.

[^WfdvKb]:  Repeating the sentiment to excuse yourself defeats the point, in addition to defeating the effort to make change.  You don't avoid terrible companies because you think that your single act will bankrupt them; you do it to limit the harm done to you, and so you can reallocate that money and time to independent creators and your favorite causes.  However, if you bring friends along, and they bring friends along, and so forth, *then* the companies will also start to take notice.  But don't start with punishment as the goal...

Around the world, we have all seen the growing protest demonstrations[^ns2TWM], the attempts in journalism and media to finally grow a spine as they realize that capitulation didn't help them---they wouldn't load up the Ellison bank accounts to buy the biggest news organizations if they didn't see signs of fighting back---the judicial opposition to the administration, the attempts to help victims while undermining abusive initiatives, the cracks forming in the Republican Party as they compete on who has a better claim to callousness, and so forth.  And while this seems to have taken forever to start and only moves slowly, if you put it into historical context, we have moved fairly quickly.

[^ns2TWM]:  I don't believe that those particular demonstrations will produce serious results, if only because they happen on weekends and off in parks, where they can't inconvenience anybody in power.  Unlike "voting with your wallet," you demonstrate almost entirely to direct attention.  They also focus explicitly and exclusively on Trump, rather than harmful policies that his checklist of [Twenty-Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) successors would presumably continue.  I still approve, though, because the sheer size has started to draw attention, which shows people that they haven't gone through this alone, and that we have plenty of space to band together, plus forcing the media to reconcile what we can all see with the idea that nothing matters beyond the horse-race.

I didn't save the post, but I saw a breakdown somewhere on social media that, throughout modern history, people have opposed authoritarianism on various grounds.  Organized resistance, however, typically takes many years to find its voice and begin working, whether we mean the abolition of slavery or the torture programs created as part of the so-called War on Terror.  Even during the first Trump administration, other than the inauguration itself, it took almost the entire four years for much more than online hashtags to go anywhere.

This time, though, maybe because the 2024 Trump campaign announced its plans in Project 2025, opposition in the United States started to form immediately.  For all the claims of "unprecedented" behavior over the past year, often talking about things that right-wing politics has done for a lifetime or more, you would actually have a hard time finding a less precedented event than the rapid rise of *actual* resistance in the United States, not yet unified or organized, with too many thinking that you finish the job by filling up somebody's e-mail, but openly opposed to the administration's agenda.  And it has grown to a degree in only a couple of months that the political outlook for next year has totally changed from potentially never getting these creeps out of office to potentially getting the authoritarians out of *both* chambers of Congress and impeaching everybody left.  It probably won't go that far, disappointing everybody, but the fact that the chance even exists amazes me.

### The Broligarchy

Contrary to the increasing resistance of millions of angry people taking to the streets in defense of democracy, we have also seen companies across the country drop their masks to make it clear that the corporate world has become the only safe harbor for authoritarianism.  We have always known this, on some level, because companies have feudal structures, with a monarch who farms out their power and responsibilities to a managerial/noble class, each of whom employs their vassals, maybe several layers deep, to manage and secure a particular fief.

And this makes sense, considering that the modern corporation comes out of colonialism and mercantilism, with companies such as the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) thought of as the modern corporations.

Still, despite presumably needing customers, they have all fallen all over themselves to either shovel money and support at authoritarian governance or push AI into every corner of every product, seemingly to curry favor with those same authoritarians desperate for "supremacy" for a technology that doesn't have any serious uses that people would pay for.

Didn't they promise us that Atlas would shrug?  Can't Atlas hurry up and shrug already, instead of trying to sell us on cryptocurrency, NFTs, the metaverse, and language models ushering in a new age...?

## Technology

Most of my day, as you can probably guess, involves some aspect of a computer.  This year has seen a lot of experimentation, at least partly out of necessity.

### Computer Hardware

This year, I needed to move over to a Framework laptop.  I've mentioned this before, since the crash of the System 76 laptop traumatized me a bit in how poorly prepared I felt for the eventuality.  I did prepare slightly, though, in that I had purchased the refurbished Framework chassis a couple of years back[^N58Llx], so after scavenging for components, I only needed to buy memory.  And, despite the newly overt [awful politics of the company]({% post_url 2025-10-19-big-tents %})---not that larger manufacturers do any better---it definitely does the job, though the USB ports on one side either flake out uncomfortably often or they shipped broken "expansion cards" to convert from the USB-3 ports to whatever I need...and I have no intention of sending it in for repairs.

[^N58Llx]:  If I mentioned that I needed to borrow it from someone---I know that I did at some point, but maybe in personal conversation instead of on the blog---that confusion arose because I remembered that *somebody* bought the thing, but forgot that somebody looked a lot like me.  After deciding that, yes, it looked nice, I left the box in a corner for when I had the time and spare cash to buy the components.

In addition, my computing footprint has expanded into a second laptop---used for specific tasks, after using it as the "spare" for so long---and two old Raspberry Pi[^AYGVF4] units used as servers, in an attempt to try to have a better chance of a fast recovery if (when) this machine craps out.

[^AYGVF4]:  Yes, Raspberry Pi *also* has terrible politics, trying to make its product a centerpiece of police surveillance.  I wouldn't recommend buying them today, especially as alternatives exist and Raspberry Pi's prices have increased.  However, more than a decade ago when I bought them, we didn't exactly have many options for cheap, small computers.

I do want to add another mini-server to the mix, something with more power, for reasons that I'll get to in a bit.  Before I shell out money, I want to evaluate what I have---similar to using the Raspberry Pi units---since I might have something that not only works, but has more *oomph*, an Ethernet port, ideally a video port, and so forth[^c_0RvW].

[^c_0RvW]:  I have a mini-PC that matches the description, actually, but as I mentioned in Monday's post, [that machine crashes under load]({% post_url 2025-12-22-ramanujan %}), rendering it useless unless I figure out the problem.  The "spare laptop" also answers to the description, and I have used it for the media server before, but using that requires finding a replacement for *it* to run my overnight script that lets me take notes if something wakes me up in the middle of the night; and I do have a semi-working laptop even older than the spare, but half its keyboard doesn't respond, making it useless for taking notes, and it doesn't have an Ethernet port...

Anyway, speaking of running servers at least partly for recovery purposes...

### Software

This year, following on from that computer move, my personal software headlines went to what the Internet now calls "self-hosting."  We used to call it "running software," but whatever.  For my daily activity, at least in and around my house, I can now get by with nothing more than a web browser, a podcast client, and a terminal emulator---with my preferred [password manager](https://www.passwordstore.org/)---on the laptop or any other machine, because the servers run the following collection of services.

- [2FAuth](https://2fauth.app/), as a backup for my usual desktop two-factor authentication application
- [Calmness](https://calmness.app/), as a guide to breathing exercises that I should probably do
- [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server), as a text editor and integrated development environment (IDE)
- [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.org/), as a full office suite
- [Fresh RSS](https://freshrss.org/), as my new favorite RSS feed reader
- [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), as a git hosting service, comparable to GitHub or Codeberg, more the latter, which actually runs on Forgejo
- [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance), as a dashboard packed with a variety of things that I might want to check
- [Hextris](https://hextris.io/), a quick game
- [Inf Cloud](https://inf-it.com/open-source/clients/infcloud/), as the user interface for my calendar
- [Izo Wave](https://github.com/tangbobo/izowave), something like a tower defense game
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), as the media server
- [Moodist](https://moodist.mvze.net/), as a white noise generator
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), which I primarily use to run [embedding models](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models), but also occasionally farm out data recognition/extraction tasks to small, lightweight models; I *don't* use the chat interface or ask it to generate anything, for reasons that I have talked about endlessly elsewhere
- [Own Tracks](https://owntracks.org/), which records my walks
- [Parchment](https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment), providing the ability to play Infocom games and independent games that use the same technology
- [Radicale](https://radicale.org/v3.html), as the database side of my calendar, which Inf Cloud taps into
- [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori), as my bookmark manager
- [Snappy Mail](https://snappymail.eu/), as an e-mail client
- [YaCy](https://yacy.net/), as a search engine

Other than Ollama, which has a specific and narrow use case for me, I recommend them all, if you want a new approach to the use or need a backup for a desktop application or online service.  Jellyfin, Ollama, and YaCy need some hefty resources and so can't/shouldn't run on an old Raspberry Pi---hence my agonizing over another server above---but the rest work shockingly well.  Maybe importantly, everything will work even without an Internet connection, though YaCy won't provide particularly good results, and I wouldn't have any way of looking at them.

Note that the git host doesn't actually replace anything in my workflow, except to the extent that it gives me a place where I can find the various repositories that I previously left lying around servers like where I serve the blog from.

Also worth mentioning, I still like the desktop equivalents of that sort of software, which I have used for decades.  However, in a memory-limited situation such as I currently have, I don't want to run any more on the desktop than I need to.  When RAM prices[^juNSJr] come down, or I have significantly more disposable income, I'll re-evaluate running [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) and the like.

[^juNSJr]:  As I write this, prices jumped because of Donald Trump's ill-advised tariffs, and then jumped again because a billionaire decided that he needed to consolidate that market, and *then* decided to sell primarily to AI data centers, cutting the supply at an already-inflated cost significantly.  With that outlook, and by supplementing the machine with the little servers, I can probably get by on my pre-owned eight gigabytes for a while, even if that means that I probably won't learn Blender anytime soon...

I have also looked at some other software that impressed me, but for one reason or another, I couldn't deploy it in the time that I had available to work out how.

- [Cloverleaf](https://github.com/cloverleaf/web) would supplement a password manager by generating consistent passwords; I created a [less impressive clone](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/keywand), but would rather use something more proven and having better random numbers.  But I couldn't get Cloverleaf to build.
- [Graphite](https://graphite.art/) would provide a backup system for image editing---[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)---that I often use for the blog images and other projects.  The Graphite team doesn't release pre-built versions, yet, and while it would probably build without any trouble, doing so would require setting up a Rust build environment on the Raspberry Pi, space and time that I could use for something else.
- [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) handles translation, *but* required a far heftier server than I have available.  I use hosted versions often, 
- [Neko](https://neko.m1k1o.net/) would give me a web browser...that I could run from a web browser, which sounds like it doesn't make sense, but if the server has more power than the client, such as if I needed to work from an old tablet for a day, then that would reduce the load on the local computer even further.  However, when I tried to install it, steps sent me to a free trial of a commercial service; either I misunderstood something, or something doesn't match reality.
- [Posio](https://github.com/abrenaut/posio) makes for a fun diversion, but has too many pieces to install for me to even consider trying to run it at home.
- [QR Frame](https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng/) seems worth playing with more.  Again, I couldn't figure out how to get it to build, though the creator did some work to help.

I also tried, but failed, to find a viable web-based podcast client.  Anyway, I looked at a *lot* of software, this year.  I didn't try to install everything, but for almost every item on both lists, I needed to compare it to at least two competitors, and I probably checked out a bunch of projects that sounded interesting even if it didn't seem like I'd use them.

It also seems worth noting that, during this year, I migrated all my projects (that went anywhere) over to Codeberg from GitHub.  Microsoft has increasingly exerted control over the latter, and increasingly tried to turn it into an AI-centric platform, so it seemed like a good time to focus my attention elsewhere.  I continue to push changes to both hosting services, because I don't want to cede what amounts to a "professional presence" in some circles, but all new work now goes to the independent site.

### Programming Languages

I should also note that, as a last-minute incident worth including in a year-in-review, I have started looking at [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the first time in at least a decade.  A lot of the attitude[^akEYiV] still bothers me about the language, but with the [Ruby community's weird collapse](https://www.dorokhovich.com/blog/ruby-crisis-takeover), my long concern that [Rails hasn't advanced]({% post_url 2021-08-08-framework %}) in almost twenty years (unless you count its creator focusing on becoming a right-wing weirdo), and the [Python Software Foundation walking away from a hefty grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html) because it would've required them to change their DEI policy made an investigation appealing.

[^akEYiV]:  I have trouble taking a language created after my birth seriously if it relies on layout.  And it irritates me to no end that, for many years, if you criticized the language or recommended any other language, cultists would show up to insist that nobody can ever possibly find an easier or cleaner language than Python, when I can assure you that doesn't hold water, and that Python has nothing making it easier to learn than anything else, except for the inquisitors asking why you haven't converted yet...

And since I wanted to use Ollama---see above---to set up semantic searches of my notes, a project that requires accessing the file system, checking recent git history, making web requests, working with an SQLite database with a vector extension, and Ollama itself, Python's wide base of libraries made that a better match than trying to make this work in something like Ruby or JavaScript, let alone Rust or C#.

The investigation hasn't gotten too deep, yet, not even long enough for me to overcome my existing distaste for *maybe* the goofiest syntax that I have ever worked with[^8a2-8E].  But if it doesn't turn me off, maybe I'll start finding more uses for it.  Or I'll bury myself deeper in Tcl/Tk...

[^8a2-8E]:  And yes, I include all the toy/joke/puzzle languages in that assessment.  I haven't the foggiest idea why Python wants to both rely on spacing *and* use almost as many symbols as a C-like language, but not in the same way that anybody else uses them.  It doesn't seem to aim for readability, conciseness, ability to skim, ease of parsing, or really anything else.  That won't prevent me from using it if it works better than other options, but it does mean that I haven't ever prioritized giving it a chance.

Oh, and I also learned Font Forge's scripting language, but I'll talk about that project, later.

## Releases

While I mess around with a lot of projects, much to my dismay, I haven't released as many significant projects as I would have liked.  But we'll go through what I have managed.

### The League of the Silver Bat

I came into the year with much loftier ambitions, but I don't think that I took on anything more substantial than re-releasing [my novel]({% post_url 2025-09-14-revisit-silver-bat %}), editing and revising the text for a second edition, as well as creating a build system that lets me keep it up to date in the future.

While I laughed at it when I first found the project, [Quarkdown](https://quarkdown.com/) proved invaluable.  It didn't take care of everything, and it makes some odd decisions, but I admit that it did a great job of converting my Markdown files to a usable PDF e-book, after some search-and-replace work to make it happy.  Add some [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [PDF Toolkit](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) work, and I got a credible result with front and back covers.

Weirdly, to get an EPUB, I needed to revert to [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which doesn't appear to use back covers, but seems otherwise close enough.

{% codeberg jcolag/silver-bat-01-seeking-refuge %}

While I released the second edition under the same CC BY-SA license as the first, it'll stay behind the paywall for another couple of months before I update the Codeberg repository with the newer Markdown and associated files, part of an experiment, to see what funding Free Culture projects actually looks like, which inspired me to create the [site store](/store) to list the various ways that motivated people can support me.

For the curious, so far, it looks suspiciously like not funding things[^eeLeon]. {% emoji person shrugging %}

[^eeLeon]:  I can't rightly complain, here.  While I'd certainly love to sustainably work on Free Culture projects full-time and have a model that other creators might build on, I also didn't go into the choice with any expectations of getting that flexibility.

### Key Wand

As mentioned earlier, I wanted to have Cloverleaf running on my local servers.  At its core, it takes an application name and single, primary password as the [seed state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) to generate a random password.  Because it uses that specific information to guide the random generation, the software can always reproduce the password with the same inputs, so you don't need to save those passwords anywhere.

{% codeberg jcolag/keywand %}

I couldn't get it to build and deploy to my server, though, so I opted to make my own, removing the libraries that I couldn't get to work locally, and putting together my own user interface.  It takes away some of the more modern aspects of the randomness that Cloverleaf has, but doesn't require anything like a build process.

Along the way, I decided to make some small (in my opinion) enhancements to the workflow.  If you supplied an API key and give it a domain name to identify the application, then it uses [Logo.dev](https://www.logo.dev/) to show the site logo, providing validation that you typed it correctly; if not, it has a list of applications---courtesy of Cloverleaf---and their password requirements, so that you don't need to worry about that...unless Cloverleaf's list has fallen out of date.  In addition, my version adds an optional user ID, since people might have multiple accounts for some systems.

You can [use Key Wand](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/keywand/) right on Codeberg, as a proof of concept.  Everything except for the logos---because of CORS restrictions, for those of you who do web work---should also work if you pull down the repository and open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

### Games

{% codeberg jcolag/mystic-t-square %}

{% codeberg jcolag/salavi %}

Neither of these really qualifies as *new*, because I set up the base years ago before wandering off to other projects.  However, they now resemble my original vision.

- Mystic T-Square got an AI---the classical kind, where it tries to calculate the best next move, not the language model kind that tells you about gluing cheese to pizza---second player, so that we can all play alone.  You can [play Mystic T-Square](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/mystic-t-square/) right on Codeberg, too.
- SaLaVI, similarly, finally extends the ancient model of *karma* against *kama* with what it has always needed, an inflexible dark vigilante patrolling the path to vimoksha for suspicious ne'er-do-wells exactly like yourself.  It also no longer requires generating a board separately, so you can [play SaLaVI on Codeberg](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/salavi/).

They can probably both withstand even further work and polish, but they also come pretty close to my initial visions for them.

### Libera Marks

While digging through archives looking for [Question Copyright material to preserve]({% post_url 2025-08-24-trawling-qco %})---technically a release of its own, though I can't rightly take credit for posting somebody else's writing somewhere semi-permanent---I most liked two their tongue-in-cheek proposals.

- Rebranding CC BY-SA as [CC Pro](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/118-cc-pro.html), since the license covers almost everything---except for a requirement to publish "source" material---that creators who have an interest in sharing want.
- Generalizing the non-commercial and no-derivatives licenses into [Creative Commons Attribution No-Value](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/367-cc-nv.html), a license that "allows covered works to be distributed freely with proper attribution, as long as no recipient derives any value whatsoever from them, including but not limited to personal pleasure, commercial gain, or artistic benefit."

{% codeberg jcolag/libera-marks %}

I came close to adding the mock-up license icons in that aforementioned post about Question Copyright, but realized that a derivative work should credit Creative Commons and refer to their license for such things, only to discover that [Creative Commons doesn't release rights to those icons](https://creativecommons.org/policies
/#:~:text=How%20you%20can%20use%20CC%20trademarks), making those technically copyright infringement (though almost certainly falling under Fair Use, as parody).

Because of that policy, I replaced the license icon used for this blog (at the bottom of the page) with something evocative without infringing, but the incident made me wonder if the "license component" icons---the guy in the circle, the crossed-out dollar sign, and so forth---also qualify as trademarks, and so similarly not available under a free license.  Thinking it better safe than sorry, I pulled Terry Hancock's version of the icons on the [page of alternative license logos](https://freedomdefined.org/Logos_and_buttons), modified a few to fill out the set, and used [Font Forge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/)'s scripting engine to create a font that covers the Creative Commons symbols in Unicode.  On the blog, that makes it possible to replace the old font of Creative Commons symbols with these, so that I can identify {% cc pd %}, {% cc 0 %}, {% cc by %}, {% cc by-sa %}, {% cc by-nc %}, {% cc by-nc-sa %}, {% cc by-nd %}, and {% cc by-nc-nd %} licenses in blog posts.

And as I mentioned earlier in the year, this also raised the point that the Creative Commons iconography mostly stinks in general.  Outside the zealot community, what about "left-curving arrow pointing to its own tail" says "if you share this, then you must do so under the terms under which you received it"?  What about a circled equals sign says that nobody granted you the right to modify or adapt the work?  Even "person standing" doesn't really indicate crediting the work's creator.  I haven't done anything with that insight, but it has started me thinking about what the Unicode symbols should or could look like, if we'd rather not user or evoke a specific organization's trademarks in describing licenses.

### Tech Tips

Speaking of blog posts, I managed to carve out time to talk about three technical issues that I couldn't find the cleanest documentation for.

* Scouting around [Firefox's Local Storage]({% post_url 2025-05-14-firefox-local-storage %}) to extract what applications---such as Key Wand, Mystic T-Square, and SaLaVI, for a couple of examples---save to the browser.
* Extracting the current state of [Firefox's Tabs]({% post_url 2025-05-21-firefox-tabs %}) to check through the open pages and history information.
* Dealing with [too many SSH keys]({% post_url 2025-08-06-ssh-keys %}), now that I need to deal with multiple git hosting services and physical servers.

I often regret not having more of these mini-tutorials or even minor insights, but if I don't spot anything new and not already well-documented, then it feels dishonest to scramble to imagine something technical that I *could* talk about.

### Sunday Rants

This year, I've written about a fair range of topics, some recurring.

* [Free Our Feeds](https://freeourfeeds.com/) has since dramatically scaled back their absurd pitch begging for thirty million dollars so that they could (somehow) make the Bluesky ecosystem more distributed, even though [AT doesn't decentralize well](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/).  But it got me wondering what that kind of money could do in Free Culture spaces, beyond the boring (if important) and unsustainable idea of handing it out to individual creators.  As yet, I have proposed an [educational system]({% post_url 2025-05-04-30m-free-education %}), a [weekly series]({% post_url 2025-07-13-30m-weekly-series %}), and a [Free Culture studio]({% post_url 2025-11-02-30m-free-culture-studio %}).
* As with everyone else, I have returned to dealing with the AI bubble, this year trying to tease out what [lies behind AI usage]({% post_url 2025-01-19-ai-usage %}) and enumerating a [generative AI wish list]({% post_url 2025-06-08-ai-wish-list %}) to try to reframe the problem.
* For reasons that you probably already know, politics also came up frequently, including talking about the [dangerous fatalism in political discourse]({% post_url 2025-02-09-resist %}), the [value of diversity]({% post_url 2025-02-16-dei %}), a [look at patriarchy]({% post_url 2025-03-30-patriarchy %}), the [need for solidarity]({% post_url 2025-06-01-one-fight %}) across allegedly different political fights, the [empty political phrases]({% post_url 2025-06-15-go-nowhere-fast %}) that make vicious attacks look accidental, the obsession with [big tents]({% post_url 2025-10-19-big-tents %}), the [meaning of dystopia]({% post_url 2025-11-09-look-around %}), blaming strife on [outside agitators]({% post_url 2025-11-30-locally-sourced-hate %}), and a half-baked idea of [connectivity-based politics]({% post_url 2025-12-14-connections %}).
* As always, I spent quite a bit of time on Free Culture topics.  That started with [rethinking the copyright debates]({% post_url 2025-05-18-copyright-thoughts %}) and the aforementioned [trawling through Question Copyright's archives]({% post_url 2025-08-24-trawling-qco %}) for its interesting material, then moving into the start of a lengthy series trying to define (or maybe redefine) Free Culture, including an [elevator pitch]({% post_url 2025-09-21-define-free-culture-1 %}), some [philosophy]({% post_url 2025-10-05-free-culture-philosophy %}), some [history]({% post_url 2025-10-26-define-free-culture-history %}), the [structures and mechanisms]({% post_url 2025-11-16-free-culture-mechanics %}), and some additional [licensing information.]({% post_url 2025-11-23-free-culture-licensing-2 %}), with more to come in 2026.

Topics also varied quite a bit beyond those larger themes, including the following.

* Talking about getting into [exercise]({% post_url 2025-01-12-exercise %}) and its effects.
* Breaking down the [Creative Commons Signals]({% post_url 2025-06-29-signal-change %}) initiative and where it seems to have gone awry.
* Some sources to visit for [identifying fictional things]({% post_url 2025-07-20-naming %}), so that your imaginary address doesn't accidentally point to someone's house and your imaginary website doesn't open an opportunity to scamming your audience.
* Hypothesizing a [payment processor]({% post_url 2025-07-27-payment-processor %}) resistant to the whims of centralized corporations.
* Praise for [public media]({% post_url 2025-08-10-public-media %}) in the United States, even as the government tries to eliminate its funding sources.

It also looks like this year had the most Sunday posts, by the way, narrowly edging out the former high-water mark in 2021.  In some ways, I have started to think of these posts as the "core" of the blog.  Specifically, while I still often have some fun with the other days of the week and consider especially the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) the most important work that I do here, the obligatory nature of them feels...*corporate*, I think, the sorts of posts that one might write to "build a brand" or try to spin off into a content marketing blog.  For example, it doesn't take much to imagine some topsy-turvy alternate timeline in which a more pro-corporate version of me desperately aspired to become a *Star Trek* writer, and so published only those posts to a standalone blog that also feigned excitement at every studio announcement and talked about what *I* would do with various plot points, to give myself an authoritative image.  By contrast, the Sunday posts tend to defy that brand-like aspect more, by talking about whatever I might have on my mind.

### Fiction

I managed to publish one short story, this year---two if you count the [Silver Bat prologue]({% post_url 2025-09-28-silver-bat-preview %}) chapter to tease the book's release---this one taking the right-wing [transgender athlete bans]({% post_url 2025-06-22-title-ix-hope %}) to their logical absurd conclusion.

Along with those, while I didn't *write* them, I wanted to put [*The Comet*]({% post_url 2025-02-23-comet %}) by W.E.B. du Bois, what I called [*The (Other) Discovery of America*]({% post_url 2025-10-12-beauchene %}), and Louisa May Alcott's [*A Christmas Dream*]({% post_url 2025-12-21-christmas-dream %}) in front of people as some seasonal cheer for Black History Month, Indigenous Peoples' Day, and the winter solstice season flooded with holidays.

### Entropy Arbitrage

The big headlines on the blog itself for 2025 probably deal with my ongoing goal to make the blog more usable.  As some examples, I've added the following features.

* The link to the Markdown source of every post now points to Codeberg instead of the GitHub equivalent, including finally fixing the icon.
* Through the magic of the [Cook](https://cooklang.org/) recipe markup language, blog posts now sometimes include nice-looking recipe cards.
* Blog posts now have "labels" as well as "tags," so that I can connect posts thematically here in ways that wouldn't make sense for discoverability on social media.
* We can now look at the history of posts in a [calendar view](/blog/calendar).
* We now have the ability to search for posts by the intersection of [tags and labels](/blog/tag-search).
* The site now uses view transitions, giving the loose appearance (at least on Chrome-like browsers) of turning pages.

Not on the blog proper, but overall site now includes a [store](/store).  And due to Mailchimp pulling the ability to publish a "custom layout" e-mail behind its API, my final use of Mailchimp comes in a few days when I send out what I have ready for the December newsletter and another recommendation to [follow me on Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) to continue reading the newsletter.

I have made many other small changes along the way, but I suspect that this list should make the biggest difference, going forward.  And six years in, the blog has nearly fifteen hundred posts published, containing over two and a half million words, if you can believe that.

## Personal

Finally, I've learned a thing or two about myself, I think.

### Cord-Cutting After-Effects (Still) Continue

Years back, now, I [canceled my cable television subscription]({% post_url 2021-04-04-cord-cut %}) when I realized that I had almost completely stopped watching television.  For a while, I would still leave local news on in the background when I didn't have something else to watch, but as they became less local and more interested in the ubiquitous anxiety-farming loops, even that stopped happening.  At the time, I predicted that act would start to cascade out to streaming services, because when I pay for a service, I feel compelled to find *something* to watch every day to justify the cost, and that feels more stressful than worth the money.

Over the intervening years, I dropped Netflix, then Amazon Prime.  Last year, Hulu, Disney+, Paramount+, and even Ovid all got the axe.  I *like* Ovid, by the way; it comes absurdly cheap with a coupon, and the money goes to independent studios instead of a monopolist, but I also didn't really watch it.  Partly, this whole process accelerated because I set up my own media server using the aforementioned Jellyfin, leaving me with a significant library of material that I never got around to watching, *and* costs no monthly fee, *and* works even without an Internet connection.

At this point, in terms of the normal paid services, I have Peacock because it comes free with Instacart+, and I only have Instacart+ because I get a discount with my Costco membership.  And like the others, I don't really watch much, there.  Otherwise, I spend most of my time on my own server, library-supported services [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/) and [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com), and the [Roku Channel](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/).  Occasionally, I'll see if Tubi has something interesting {% sfx ahem %} without DRM, for [reasons](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (as I mentioned last year) that I probably don't want to detail but might relate to Fox Corporation owning them.

This year, though, I finally *added* a service, donating to my local PBS station for a [Passport](https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/5000692392-what-is-pbs-passport-) gift subscription.  Mostly, I did so because public television needs and deserves support, but it also turns out that I love the material there more than I have enjoyed what I've found on any commercial streaming service.  In my case, that means as much musical theater as they'll shovel down the pipe, but also some cooking shows, a lot of mysteries (too many focusing on police), science, and arts, but they have *so* much more.

#### Plugging Public Media

If I sold you on public television, or if one can only sell you by following the route of bake-off competition shows, celebrity ancestry, historical documentary, independent film, and a shocking amount of country music, PBS has you covered there, too.  However, if you wanted to donate for similar reasons, I would strongly recommend that you take a more strategic approach than I did.

Rather than donate to your local PBS station---which in my case has such solid funding that it loses almost nothing from the end of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting---poke around [Adopt a Station](https://adoptastation.org/) to find a television (or radio, if you prefer NPR) station that has lost a significant part of its budget.  On the radio side, you can find stations operating at somewhere around ten percent capacity, so your five dollars makes a far bigger difference to them than some station in an affluent suburb.  And because those stations usually sit in news deserts *and* areas prone to natural disasters, money spent there saves lives while you watch the cozy show about the veterinarian or whatever else...

### In Memoriam

Normally, I don't comment on or even really notice celebrity deaths, beyond "too bad that we lost Harry Belafonte," or Norman Lear, or Angela Lansbury, or whoever, because while I often appreciate and like their work, they never became a part of my life as *people*, and the parts of them that did become a part of my life continue on, in that I can always check out their recorded performances.  It also often annoys me that some mediocre people get big tributes because they got to participate in some beloved property[^BB9RLj], but not brilliant people who also spent their time openly fighting for equality, which gets me to tamp down on my mentioning these things.

[^BB9RLj]:  I have Betty White in mind, here, who mostly played the same character on every show for her entire career, and---at least in public, though apparently not always behind the scenes---tried to maintain an "apolitical" appearance, only airing her views on only animal welfare.  I often find myself contrasting her with somebody like Sidney Poitier, a far more powerful and versatile performer who died at around the same time, but also a loud voice for civil liberties.  But everybody grew up watching either **The Mary Tyler Moore Show** or **The Golden Girls**, so she got endless tributes, whereas he barely got mentioned.

This year, though, maybe because their work seemed so personal *and* resonated with me so much, a handful of deaths hit me a bit harder than I would have expected.  Among them, well, all white guys who actually mostly lived nice, long lives, a bit embarrassing to line up like this, but I grew up with their work...

[David Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch) might not actually belong on the list, because I didn't get *that* deep into his work or personality beyond enjoying **Twin Peaks** and finding his interviews enjoyable, but it may have primed the pump of my thinking about these deaths, so to speak, because he seemed to have new projects in the works.

[Tom Lehrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer), whose entertainment career I largely followed in reverse, first discovering his music on **The Electric Company** as a child, then an older friend introducing me to his comedy albums from decades prior.  I then introduced my friends to his material.  A couple of years back, he released his music and lyrics (but probably not his recordings, based on the phrasing) into the public domain, prompting me to write a [Free Culture Book Club post for his work]({% post_url 2022-08-13-lehrer %}).

[Tom Stoppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard), whose work I encountered in high school English class, when the teacher followed **Hamlet** up with **Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead**, both the play and the then-still-new film.  I "clicked" with his writing, and spent the next weeks at the public library devouring his other plays, everything on the shelf and whatever the librarian could get me through inter-library loan, and have subjected a disturbing proportion of people in my life to that film.  I only recently got around to checking out his **Arcadia** (which he published later) and loved every bit of it.  And, in his death, I find out that he packed modern science, history, and jokes of every kind into his work with barely any formal education.

[Rob Reiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner)'s projects have probably sat in my field of vision the longest, since my family loved **All in the Family**.  He had his fingerprints all over film at the same time that I encountered the work of the other three, and while I wouldn't call it the same kind of work---Lynch, Lehrer, and Stoppard all wove their humor and drama out of academia, in some way, while Reiner took a more emotional approach---I couldn't resist that kind of artistry.  And both his work and his life leaned towards some of the best activism.

Maybe this does all relate to *my* age when I got attached to their work, rather than any connection.  But I also think that these four also sat in that interesting class of artist that combines craft with deep education and whimsy, without worrying about and even embracing the weirdness, which speaks to me.  And I know that it happens more than white men in their prime decades ago, because I see that combination most often today in Afrofuturist works.  Still, no matter the reasons, for the first time since maybe Douglas Adams, I have found myself actually needing to mourn celebrity deaths.

### Community, Part 2

Last year, I had a section in the counterpart to this post talking about how we have atomized the act of building culture---seemingly having the Free Culture movement in mind but only mentioning it in passing because the idea probably applies more broadly than that---into a series of individualistic and isolated actions, and that this fails us, because culture only makes sense as a communal act[^2dGf-I].

[^2dGf-I]:  I'll probably give this idea an entire post at some point, but it has occurred to me that this explains a lot of why AI art doesn't "work," that it only takes from everybody else to extrude an art-like shell that doesn't express any connection to its sources or its audience.  It doesn't care if you see it, let alone have an emotional reaction to or an opinion of it.  In the same way, I have started to wonder if maybe we should treat corporate products in the same way, because the major studios certainly don't want your input and don't care if they form a personal connection with you or their inspirations any more than ChatGPT does; they only care about whatever they use for audience metrics in a given fiscal quarter so that they can estimate the return on the investment of manufacturing more of the thing.

As such, it feels like we need a template for communities aimed at creation.  This makes the most sense in Free Culture spaces, I think, because we already have the invitation to contribute and collaborate "built in," and really only need the framework and participation.  For example, we know that "throw it over the wall" never works.  People might enjoy the work, but that enjoyment almost never translates into contributions or people making it their own.  It also doesn't work to provide an unfinished project or the "components" for a project, often with the claim that they've left open the parts that people like to do for themselves, but again, you almost never see somebody finish another person's project.  Likewise, setting up myriad channels for people to provide input rarely works without an existing community.

We don't have marketing budgets at all, let alone budgets that can compete in centralized markets that demand anxiety and frustration of its audience.  We don't even have a forum or a common language to announce or talk about new projects, meaning that, for all we know, almost everything vanishes into obscurity.  Forget about coordinating collaboration or helping people *sell* their work to an audience.

I still, as you can guess, don't have any solutions to this[^tE0HhL], and invite opinions.  In many ways, maybe that aforementioned *Defining Free Culture* series of posts has the subconscious motivation of getting this particular ball rolling, starting with identifying the community as something more interesting than a random assortment of libertarian weirdos bitter that they would need to negotiate licensing fees to produce another season of **My Sister Sam** or whatever.

[^tE0HhL]:  The fact that I think about this on my own instead of having a think tank of Free Culture creators devising and testing different approaches to share the results probably necessitates my failure in figuring out how to build communities, in fact.  But I also wouldn't expect to get far in building *that* by approaching a bunch of creators for a "play date" and no plan, so that still leaves me at the "lacking a workable idea" stage, if a slightly different missing idea.

### Hobby Time

Do you remember my mentioning that the USB ports---or maybe the adapters, I don't know---flake out on my Framework laptop?  As a result of that and the number of other things that I have wanted to get done, I have paused practicing [stenography]({% post_url 2021-11-28-steno %}) for a while, but while I practiced regularly, I could see some improvements, able to type entire paragraphs, if slower than I would like and still needing to look words up when my initial guess didn't work.

In hopes of increasing the chances of more practice next year, I did (days ago) spring for an "Extra"---I assume that they meant overstock or similar---[Asterisk](https://stenokeyboards.com/products/asterisk-keyboard) keyboard, a single plate with touch-sensitive areas for the keys.  I compromised on proprietary hardware, because (apart from the sale price) the lightweight single piece with no moving parts should mean that I can cover my laptop's keyboard (probably with a thin board underneath it) when I sit outside in warmer weather, instead of worrying about where I'll put the bulky and heavy (but Open Hardware) [SOFT/HRUF Splitography](https://softhruf.love/products/soft-hruf-erl).

And as a likely bonus, since it doesn't work with fingers resting on it, the keyboard should translate to higher speeds once I get used to it.

Despite planning multiple projects out, I didn't get to any sewing, 3D printing, or secret (and probably not any good for a long time) music projects, which disappoints me a bit, but I'll get to everything eventually...

## Conclusions

In most years' end-of-year posts, I say something like the following.

 > Growth takes affirmative effort, rarely happening on its own, whereas it feels surprisingly comfortable to neglect yourself into bad habits.

I still stand by that sentiment.  And as I age---indeed, I *might* have a birthday coming before the end of the year---you can probably imagine that I need to consciously put in that effort more frequently, because habits become comfortable quickly.

Enough about me, though...well, at least until tomorrow's [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) post and then next Sunday's look ahead at 2026.  How did *your* 2025 go?  Other than the "state of the world" parts, I mean...
