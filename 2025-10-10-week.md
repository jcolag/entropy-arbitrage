* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > To be sure, the CSIS report found that left-wing violence is on the rise this year. But it is still outweighed by the number of attacks carried out by right-wing extremists in recent history.

Hashtags:  #USPol #PoliticalViolence #Extremism

I haven't read the CSIS report, so I wonder if it goes into enough depth to tell whether the "rising" left-wing violence comes from defending people from immediate threats, the fact that many jurisdictions now consider abortion worse than murder---so if you need one, you might as well go for the other---or other reasons.

By the way, I should note that Republicans could pass this without any Democrats joining them.  The Senate can (and recently did) eliminate the filibuster on an ad hoc or permanent basis, so that they only need a majority.  But they won't, because they have no problem with the country paying the economic costs.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/115333729700383141)

 > The translation into law of the new concepts of religious and economic liberty was not easily achieved any more than the enactment of fair-employment legislation will be easily won. Rigid religious conformity was woven into the law of some of the separate colonies, and rebellious sects were driven forth to found new colonies where religious freedom could flourish.

 > Unvaccinated people are far more likely to succumb to infectious diseases, as many people in low-income nations know first-hand. And the more vaccination rates fall, the more a disease can spread. The more people are exposed, the more likely they are to catch a disease, even if they are vaccinated.

As with inflicting economic harm, they have no qualms about putting everybody's health in danger.  I've said many times that they need us to turn against each other, so that their policies make any sense, so if they can find a way to make us fear contact, they'll do it.

 > Following the receipt of the gladsome news great joy and enthusiasm seemed to fill every heart; and during the night following, the occasion was celebrated by immense processions of men and boys marching through the principal streets to the music of many brass bands, the firing of cannon, and the discharge of anvils.

 > Washington‚Äôs ideal military leader was more statesman than warrior. He believed that military power must be exercised under moral constraint, within the bounds of public accountability, and always with an eye to preserving liberty rather than winning personal glory.

Either way, Hegseth wouldn't know military readiness if it fragged him in a SCIF while he tried to leak information on Signal, and that puts everybody at risk.  That seems like a trend for the week...

Do you remember when I mentioned their needing us to fear and avoid each other?  What better way than directly drum up violence in the name of stopping imaginary violence.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Where Palaver had been repulsed, Thiel extolled Schmitt‚Äôs ‚Äúrobust conception of the political,‚Äù in which ‚Äúhumans are forced to choose between friends and enemies,‚Äù and everything else is delusion. ‚ÄúThe high points of politics,‚Äù he quotes Schmitt as saying, ‚Äúare the moments in which the enemy is, in concrete clarity, recognized as the enemy.‚Äù In Thiel‚Äôs mind, Osama bin Laden was capable of this kind of politics. The West, with its fetish for individual rights and procedures, was not.

 > The man who wrote the speech that led thousands of Donald Trump‚Äôs followers to attack the Capitol, many violently, has been exploiting such dehumanizing language, including the word ‚Äúfascist‚Äù for years. He has particularly used it to refer to rule of law, the moderation of extremist ‚Äî including overtly Neo-Nazi ‚Äî speech, and Black people.

Again, a theme for the week, they can only convince us that we need more policing and surveillance (and guns) if we hate and fear our neighbors.

I often walk near my home, but when I have time, I always get a laugh from walking through town past the gyms, where they have treadmills lined up facing out.  And *none* of them ever look like they have any fun on the machines, while I get to do what I want, so this study definitely resonates with me...
