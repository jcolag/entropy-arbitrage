## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Silicon Avatar

I should note that this episode continues the non-Lore thread from [*Datalore*]({% post_url 2022-08-11-datalore %}).

 > **CARMEN**: Of course. But we also have this nesting instinct. It's exciting to find a new world, but the joy comes in making it a home. Building houses, having children.

I suppose that this gives us some insight into how at least some colonists operate, even though they've strongly implied that the Federation doesn't need many colonies anymore.

 > **RIKER**: Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight?

As always, Riker jumps directly to disgusting, finding anything with a tangential connection to sex (having children, here) interesting...

 > **RIKER**: Let's seal off this entrance.

Does he think that the snowflake-monster will shrink down and follow them on foot?  Crusher will point out that they might not have enough air, they use their phasers to turn the rocks into a heat source, and this will all cut off communication, all of which seem far more risky than whatever they gained by collapsing the entrance.  Maybe this gets more to nitpicking the plot than I'd like, but this "plan" feels so reckless that it seemed worth noting.

 > **CRUSHER**: Just scrapes and bruises, I think. I'll check further. Where's Carmen?
 >
 > **RIKER**: She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who'd fallen.

You'll notice the huge build-up of Carmen's importance to Riker's life, followed by this almost complete lack of grief at losing her.

 > **RIKER**: Everybody, stay here.

Super-paranoid, Riker and Data seem to think that the after-effects of the destruction of the colony by the giant snowflake will involve...muggers?  Cave-burglars, maybe?  Seriously, they hear scraping at the rock and immediately plan to kill something, at a time that they desperately need help.

 > **DATA**: Doctor, the cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. We surmise that the Entity was unable to penetrate that barrier.

I believe that both minerals originate with this episode.

 > **MARR**: I am aware of his origins. I'm very much aware that his brother, Lore, worked with the Crystalline Entity, led it to Omicron Theta where it killed every living thing. I don't think it's unreasonable that I should prefer to make another choice.

In a maybe-interesting twist, we've finally found somebody who has no interest in talking to Data because of his awful family, rather than his nature as an android.

 > **DATA**: As I have speculated, the presence of refractory metals---

Oh, look.  Data appears to believe that his speculation---his word, not mine---should qualify as fact.

 > **MARR**: My son died on Omicron Theta. He was sixteen when the colony was attacked. That is the reason I have become an expert on the Crystalline Entity. I have spent my life studying it, tracking it, and hoping someday to find it. And if I learn you have been helping that thing in any way whatsoever, I will see to it that you are disassembled piece by piece.

Good to know that Data *still* doesn't have any civil liberties.

 > **DATA**: If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution.

Does the computer...*not* work out the scale best to present its output data?  I feel like we already have some systems today that have started moving in that direction.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. There are two possible destinations. The Brechtian Cluster and the Argos system.

Presumably, they named the cluster for [Bertolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht), and the star for [Odysseus's dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argos_%28dog%29).

 > **PICARD**: We're not hunters, Doctor. Nor is it our role to exact revenge.

...What mission did Starfleet *send* him on, then?  They had him pick up Lady Ahab and directed him to track down the destructive thing for some reason, and I can't think of many reasons that don't involve hunting.

Actually, only one crosses my mind:  Capture, so that the Federation can use it as a weapon, but we can't do more than speculate on that.

 > **PICARD**: If we can determine what its needs are, we might find other sources to supply it.

Contrast this to how Picard has treated almost every other creature, most far less destructive, that he has had to deal with.  Where did this change of heart come from?

 > **PICARD**: Are you sure that that's it, Number One, or are you being influenced by personal feelings?
 >
 > **RIKER**: With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost people on missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with this thing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we can risk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family.

You know that I don't approve of Picard's "stuff your emotions down and shut up" approach to grief, but I'd like to point out that despite his tactics, he *does* give Riker the opportunity to grieve, here, and Riker outright denies feeling anything relevant.  Instead, he tries to juggle his desire for revenge with some vague idea that it'll sneak away to murder while they try to talk to it.

 > **DATA**: Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around a young woman named Jenina.

While we don't know Renny's specific age, they seem to treat him like a young teenager.  And so, I don't know about you, but it makes me *extremely* uncomfortable that Data refers to his girlfriend as "a young woman" and not "a girl."

 > **DATA**: I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However, from what I know of him by his memories and his writing, I do not believe he would be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now you have destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believe he would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sad now. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you.

I'd like to point out that, other than shaming an elderly, grieving woman for doing what the main cast does routinely, nobody has anything to say about the death of an apparently intelligent creature.  You'll notice that this crew *really* seems to enjoy shaming elderly women whenever they show up.

## Conclusions

We get some hand-waving into the psychology of colonization.

### The Bad

Riker continues to sexually harass any young woman unfortunate enough to stand near him, as well as his more general prurient streak of constantly wanting to talk about sex.

Related, Riker also (once again) shows almost no grief at losing someone that he allegedly considered important.

The crew seems to have no comprehension of advance planning.  In one instance, they nearly lead an entire colony to its death, by "protecting" it with approaches far more dangerous than the initial risk.  They seem to worry that rescuers will attack them, too.  And in another, they allow a civilian to casually lock them out of their own computers.

Data now appears to believe that, when he guesses at something, his colleagues should treat that guess as fact.  However, we continue to see that he has no actual rights in the Federation, with random civilians convinced that they could get him executed.

Again, we see that Picard does have a respect for novel life, but only for life that has killed large numbers of people.  Although nobody in the crew appears to stretch that respect for life much further than shaming an elderly woman who killed it.

## Next

Come back in a week, when we get a series of fish-out-of-water stories, at least one a lot of fun, in *Disaster*.
