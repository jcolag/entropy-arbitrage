## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Chase

This post feels like a huge experiment in the overall project, because I remember genuinely liking this episode when it aired, for a variety of reasons.  As such, I want to tamp down my enthusiasm and not get bogged down in whether it holds up.

By the way, in the context of the broader franchise, since the last time we checked in, the **DS9** crew dealt with the first hints of a shape-shifting civilization in *Vortex* and get caught in the middle of a perpetual war in *Battle Lines*.

 > **PICARD**: Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quarters impulse.

They seem to want to investigate a nebula by analyzing each star in turn...

 > **PICARD**: Oh, my God.

Forced as the line feels, this goes along with the collection of other hints that Picard identifies with some monotheistic religion or other that vaguely reflects popular views of Christianity.

 > **GALEN**: Then you can identify this object, Mister Picard.

You might recognize Professor Galen as [Norman Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lloyd), who I feel appeared almost everywhere during his long career, but at the time, most people would've recognized him as Dr. Daniel Auschlander on [**St. Elsewhere**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere) alongside quite a few recent guest stars, here.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, please, Mister will do fine. Well, the overall configuration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. The surface ornamentation.

Wow.  Has Picard finally found somebody who he doesn't think owes him respect?

 > **PICARD**: Oh, no. No. How can I accept this?
 >
 > **GALEN**: Graciously, Mister Picard. You could accept it graciously.

Surely, that belongs to...no, never mind.  We've all seen repeatedly that they have no issues pillaging cultural heritage sites in order to enrich some wealthy person's private collection.

 > Captain's log, supplemental. It's been over thirty years since I last saw my archaeology professor. His presence has taken me back to a time when I had considered a very different career.

When do you think that he made this choice?  We saw that he went to Starfleet Academy for his college years, against his father's wishes, in [*Tapestry*]({% post_url 2025-02-27-tapestry %}), which seems like a fairly firm career choice.  Did he work with Galen during high school?  It sounds absurd, but if he came from money, buying his way into a series of digs could have happened.

 > **GALEN**: To History. What if you could have helped Schliemann discover the City of Troy, or been with M'Tell as she first stepped on Ya'Seem. How could anything compare?

[Heinrich Schliemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann) advocated treating the works of Homer as largely historical, and indeed excavated a location that we have since considered the remnants of [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy) in modern Türkiye.  I can't help but notice the similarities to Picard, also a wealthy amateur archaeologist who often insists on treating legends as historical fact, suggesting that Galen might have chosen to mention him to needle his former student.

 > **PICARD**: I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. And he had his own children, but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so I was like the son who understood him.

Oh, so he *always* had weird codependent relationships that mimic patriarchal families.

And by the way, this feels like another hint of wealth inequality, since at least for my entire life, people other than the disproportionately wealthy---and those wanting people to see them as disproportionately wealthy---don't have much interest in having someone, especially their children, carrying on their professional lives.  Arguably, we even mark a lot of modern history by the idea that we want the (pardon the expression) next generation to have *better* lives than those we lived.

 > **GALEN**: What are you doing at this very moment? A study mission. You're like some Roman centurion out patrolling the provinces, maintaining a dull and bloated Empire.

We've heard vague hints of how people see the Federation, and this crystallizes the idea of an empire picking fights because it ran out of borders to expand and can't manage what it has.  It also identifies Starfleet as the military, its missions largely a pretext to show that they could deploy force.

 > **RIKER**: Worf!

Yes, blame the person who you tasked with shooting at them...

 > **PICARD**: The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system.

Yeah, nothing can really go wrong by blowing off a diplomatic conference, right...?  And Picard will later admit that the Federation has some important, time-critical stake in the meeting.

 > **TROI**: Captain, you can't start thinking like that. You didn't abandon him. You chose not to abandon a life-long career. It was the right decision, and in no way responsible for his death.

What happened that she has apparently started taking her job seriously?  She'll even point out the importance of that conference.  The uniform must have done it.

 > **PICARD**: Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. Mister Data, how many people on the Enterprise are from non-Federation planets?
 >
 > **DATA**: Seventeen, sir.

It sounds like the *Enterprise* has become at least slightly more diverse.  In [*Reunion*]({% post_url 2023-12-21-reunion %}), Picard asserted that the ship "currently includes representatives from thirteen planets."  Now, not only has the number increased by over thirty percent, but it doesn't include planets in the Federation.

Granted, we still count those numbers out of over a thousand people on the ship, making this roughly the same one-and-a-half percent, but I don't want to forget to call out progress, no matter how small.

 > **PICARD**: You know, this may be a long shot, but we should check each one of these seventeen people to see if they have the correct protein configurations.

Apparently, you can arbitrarily decide to harvest DNA samples from people, purely on the basis that they emigrated from territory held by a foreign government.

 > **OCETT**: My name is Gul Ocett. Identify yourselves and state your business in this star system.

And you might recognize Ocett as [Linda Thorson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Thorson), almost certainly best known for playing Tara King on [**The Avengers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_%28TV_series%29).

 > **OCETT**: He's right. As far as we know, it might just be a recipe for biscuits.

She says that like a four-billion-year-old biscuit recipe would disappoint anybody...

 > **DATA**: My upper spinal support is a poly-alloy designed to withstand extreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium.

I can't help noticing that Data feels the need to get up and lord this over the Klingon captain, rather than idly explaining it from his seat...

 > **CRUSHER**: Computer, highlight the section of the missing pattern. The missing DNA fragment should be in this system.

I have to admit that it disappoints me that "ancient aliens left a road map to find other cultures" didn't become the headline of this story.

 > **ROMULAN**: Well, it was quite a chase, wasn't it, my friends?

You might also recognize the Romulan as [Maurice Roëves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ro%C3%ABves), yet another performer with a long career.

 > **HUMANOID**: You're wondering who we are, why we have done this...

Last one:  You might recognize the ancient rando as [Salome Jens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Jens), who has *also* had an extensive career showing up almost everywhere, but fans of the franchise will know her best as the primary/"female" Changeling, with similar prosthetics, on **Deep Space Nine** starting a couple of years after this episode.  They really stacked this episode with people that most of the audience wouldn't recognize even though we absolutely should have...

 > **PICARD**: Yes, but it would've been a more fitting legacy if the message had not fallen on such deaf ears.

He means his own ears, right?  He doesn't exactly change how he sees his peers, going forward, or start preaching the virtues of comity.  I mean, even in this line, he uses his usual ableist terminology to describe bigotry.

 > **ROMULAN**: It would seem that we are not completely dissimilar after all, in our hopes, or in our fears.

Notice the one representative in the group to recognize the kinship that they all share:  The official enemies who, they constantly tell us, have nothing but hate and deceit in their hearts.  Even the Federation folks, allegedly our role-models, don't have the nerve to say any of this out loud, with Picard brushing their interstellar connections right under the carpet.

Also, not to undercut the fun pseudoscience thriller begging us to see all people as our distant relations, but everybody in this universe already knew about that kinship, no?  We've seen quite a few characters with mixed-species parentage starting with Spock, with at least Troi and Worf's kid Alexander---remember him?---currently on the ship.  And that doesn't make much sense without closer common ancestry than humans have with all other current organisms on Earth, especially once the franchise starts making it clear that the parents definitely didn't have their children engineered on some level (as secondary sources have described Spock's birth) such as in [*Birthright*]({% post_url 2025-03-06-birthright-1 %}) last month.

Anyway, the story in this episode---as I imagine many readers already know, but those who didn't may want to check out---technically continues in **Discovery**'s fifth and final season, as the crew-stranded-in-the-future races to find the technology left behind by these ancestors used to engineer life in the galaxy.

## Conclusions

While I suppose that it shouldn't surprise me, given the subject matter, we get quite a bit more out of this episode than I expected.

### The Good

Uncharacteristically, Troi seems to take her job seriously, for once.  She both tries to get Picard to work through his issues and reminds him of his responsibilities, rather than proving her loyalty.

Starfleet, or at least the *Enterprise* crew, seems to have grown slightly more diverse over the past couple of years.

### The Bad

We continue to see that the powerful can pillage archaeological sites for their own collections.

At least some people see the Federation as a failing empire acting out what it believes an enlightened civilization would perform.

They blame their non-human colleague for an unexpected outcome in combat, despite seeing that he followed their orders.

The crew completely blows off a diplomatic conference, despite repeated insistence of its importance.  Data seems to have also adopted the need to prove his superiority to aliens and making them feel small.

People find it acceptable to round up the non-citizens to have them provide biometric data for ill-defined reasons.

Picard continues to use ableist terminology, and shows no indication that news that most humanoid species in the galaxy share a common ancestor affect him at all.

### The Weird

Picard still shows sporadic signs of a religious practice.

## Stay Tuned...

Check back next week, when Riker refuses to brush his hair and worries a bit about repeated head injuries, in *Frame of Mind*.
