As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 9:07 -- Mon 30 October 2023

 > Upon examination, it was confirmed that reels 1-4 of the missing silent 35 mm print entitled: Sealed Hearts, was in the cans. The original US distribution print had lasted 50 mins and been in 5 reels.

Hashtags:  #LostMedia

In all fairness, this *does* happen, from time to time.  However, due to the nature of early film and a lack of understanding of media's value until recently, we can expect it to happen far less frequently every year.  In this case, the print even turned up thousands of miles away from where anybody would have considered seriously looking for it.

 > Regulation is, first and foremost, a truth-seeking exercise. There will never be one obvious answer to any sufficiently technical question.

Hashtags:  #Regulation #Bureaucracy

Regulation also works shockingly well, far better than any market-based solution to a problem that I've ever seen.  Rather than waiting for corporate executives to weigh the long-term profits of environmental conservation (for one example) against the immediate-term cost-savings from dumping waste in a local river, banning the latter practice benefits everyone except the people dedicated to destruction.

 > Man is an actor who plays various parts: First comes a boy, then out a lover starts; His garb is changed for, lo! A beggarâ€™s rags; Then heâ€™s a merchant with full money-bags; Anon, an aged sire, wrinkled and lean; At last Death drops the curtain on the scene.

 > While some people might presume itâ€™s always been this way, La Catrina is actually a transcultural icon whose prestige and popularity are equal parts invention and accident.

Hashtags:  #Art #DayOfTheDead #DiegoRivera

I assume that, by now, all readers know that I vastly prefer the Day of the Dead over Halloween.  I know that creative workers in particular (hi, all) find the latter an opportunity to cut loose, but anti-establishment satire and (at least notional) *ofrendas* to give a thought to those no longer with us appeals directly to me, making the history all the more interesting.

 > Public school meal debt has ballooned to $262 million per year, with an estimated 30.4 million students unable to pay for their meals.

Hashtags:  #Education #Poverty #Food

Honestly, everything about charging for school lunches feels bizarre.  Unless things have changed dramatically since I last had a school lunch, we already serve meals that only barely meet nutritional guidelines and cost as little as possible.  When you add the costs of collecting, securing, and accounting for payments, it'd probably come out cheaper to give the food away, *and* you'd have better students for it.

Again, I wouldn't call this a critical article, but Venus always seemed more interesting to me than Mars, despite the popular culture fascination with the latter.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Party Politics %}

 > Thereâ€™s no effort in this piece to consider any counterarguments. It doesnâ€™t even seriously consider why other Democrats might not have challenged Biden.

At this point, I only barely remember the days when I kept **The Atlantic** in my RSS feed reader and considered subscribing to it.  You can even find many instances in [my Twitter archive](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/) of my posting links over there.  But they jumped on the "ideological diversity" bandwagon that people invariably mean as code for laundering right-wing extremist views, and it buried their useful content.

 > After a long investigation, the bureau uncovered a massive conspiracy masterminded by white men like William King Hale, Ernest Burkhart and other non-Osage members in the community of Fairfax, Oklahoma, particularly those in positions of authority.

I can see why the incident would still haunt the community...
