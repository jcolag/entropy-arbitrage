As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The trend for various mental health encounters decreased as the NatureScore of a neighborhood increased, and the rates of mental health encounters were about 50% lower in neighborhoods with NatureScores over 60.

I don't think that you need me to say anything about this.  I like green spaces.  You like green spaces.  Brains like green spaces...

I have to hand it to them:  They definitely understand their brand.  Whenever any Republican complains about patriotism, I hope that someone makes sure to ask them what country they support, because I don't think that they mean the United States...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112044154824954741)

 > The Settlement â€¦ is an experimental effort to aid in the solution of the social and industrial problems which are engendered by the modern conditions of life in a great city. It insists that these problems are not confined to any one portion of the city. It is an attempt to relieve, at the same time, the overaccumulation at one end of society and the destitution at the other.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112049828677665439)

 > To those who say women do not desire their rights, or think they have them already, I would say, converse with any intelligent woman on the subject, and you will not find them indifferent. Woman feels deeply, keenly, her degradation, but is bound by the iron hand of custom which so long has exercised tyrant rule over her.

It would also probably help if we had a stronger abolition movement, since that would also break that cycle.  Retributive justice doesn't work, except as a way for all of us to ignore people who we don't want to deal with.

This will only compound, unfortunately, as we continue to "normalize" COVID-19 as a seasonal illness "like the flu"...not that we don't also completely ignore the damage done by the flu.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Neelima, a transwoman, visibly lives the life of a typical married man but, deep down, yearns to be validated as a woman.

In case you imagine gender and sexual minorities only exist in the West, they do not.  Intersectionality still works...

 > Many of these things are almost completely undocumented, and can only be developed by lengthy conversations with people who already built those things. [Even Mastodonâ€™s own specs say very little](https://docs.joinmastodon.org). The majority of people dismissed Content Nation as simply being a malicious attempt to slurp up their public and private content for profit. Even when Sascha tried to defend himself, [he was ridiculed and mocked](https://cloudisland.nz/@sash@noc.social/112012866697731940).

I get that people attack federated servers so often, that it makes *some* sense to assume that every problem stems from an attack.  But yeah, I can't imagine trying to build a working server or testing it on the Internet, because they treat everything as an ad hoc process that everybody should intuit.  And then add the almost complete lack of safety features, and you set the system up for disaster.

That all said, it also seems like setting a project up to offend people by not getting involved in a community before writing code that treats it as a resource.  Nobody likes feeling treated like a resource.
