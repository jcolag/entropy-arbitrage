Today marks the midpoint of [Kwanzaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwanzaa), celebrating "ujaama," or cooperative economics[^eMzW9M], encouraging celebrants to form businesses and shop in ways that allow the community to profit, instead of profiting others.

[^eMzW9M]:  The term originally referred specifically to the socialist policies in Tanzania orchestrated by [Julius Nyerere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nyerere), but has come to refer to cooperatives in general.

And on to the week's projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on...well, this gets complicated, actually.

### Mailchimp Reminder

A little over a month ago, when I sent out the November issue of the newsletter, Mailchimp popped up this little tidbit.

> Feature unlocked
>
> #### Access this Standard + feature through December 31, 2025.
>
> To continue sending custom coded emails after that date you will need to upgrade to a Standard or Premium plan.

Much as I like the newsletter, I don't like it enough to pay for a service that only exists because companies such as Mailchimp (along with Google et al.) enabled so much spam that "solving the spam problem" put up restrictions that make it almost impossible to send e-mail without corporate infrastructure behind you[^_H1Zob].

[^_H1Zob]:  Note the similarity between the e-mail situation and Mailchimp parent company Intuit's incessant lobbying to ensure that people in the United States need accounting services to guess the number that the tax collector already has.

In other words, I won't upgrade.  I also won't use their tedious manual "campaign creation" thing, so as of the new year, I won't use Mailchimp for the newsletter.  I'll send whatever I have on New Year's Eve (Wednesday), but not the "normal" Saturday drop.

### Future Scheduling

If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the sixth of January.  From now on, whether I stick exclusively with Buy Me a Coffee or find an alternative mailing service to specifically replace Mailchimp, a given month's newsletter issue will now go out on the Tuesday between the last day of the month and the sixth.

Saturdays no longer figure into this, as long as I need to drop the Mailchimp process anyway.

And if anybody has recommendations on a service that I can use in place of Mailchimp, especially if it has an API where I can hand it my generated HTML and have it set up the e-mail, you all know where to find me...

### Contents

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For November, I wrote a piece on XYZ, discussed my media consumption slanted a bit towards Hispanic American Heritage Month and Filipino American History Month, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Mini-Server, Part 18

Recently, I mentioned that my "spare" laptop has everything that I want in my media server, enough power (I ran Jellyfin on it for a while, until I needed it as a laptop again) and an Ethernet port.  However, I now use it as a dedicated computer for the bedroom, which only runs a noise-generator and my overnight script that lets me type up notes if anything wakes me up[^YUGMfi], so I'd need to replace it to move it back in as a server.

[^YUGMfi]:  The notes usually read as "woke to pee," granted, but sometimes I get an interesting dream description or an idea for a project...

I have an even older laptop, in pretty good physical shape, but half the keyboard doesn't respond, and the battery doesn't really hold a charge.  Finding an old USB keyboard, I spent some time looking at getting that back running, but for some reason, it doesn't seem to recognize that keyboard at all.  I might try to fix it, but as an early Linux version of the Dell XPS laptops[^V_lePK], I don't have high hopes for repairing things.

[^V_lePK]:  You know the deal, here.  It cost far too much at the time and has little chance of upgrading or repairing it, but it seemed like a good strategic move to show demand for computers that worked with Linux right out of the box.

## Codidact

I don't know if I would call it successful, because it seems like the request wanted something unsupported, but I at least attempted to provide a solution for [Link to Markdown line on Bitbucket](https://software.codidact.com/posts/295206/295207#answer-295207).

## SaLaVI

{% codeberg jcolag/salavi %}

If the player lands on the final square, the game finally acknowledges the winning state, though not in a particularly interesting or useful way.

It also now counts information such as the number of games played, the number of times that the player won, the number of fights with the Owl, and the number of tiles moved.  Those numbers populate to the *Statistics* screen.

And for some variety, the game expands the possible player tokens.  Previously, it only chose from the old chess piece characters, but now adds a bunch of emoji with faces...but not the smiley faces:  The space-invader {% emoji alien monster %}, Grey alien {% emoji alien %}, ghost {% emoji ghost %}, goblin {% emoji goblin %}, ogre {% emoji ogre %}, poo {% emoji turd %}, devil {% emoji smiling face with horns %}, robot {% emoji robot %}, and cat {% emoji grinning cat %}.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

You should now see---starting in [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2025-12-28-review-2025 %}), in fact---annotation icons for links to the [Libre Translate](https://libretranslate.com), [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net) sites.

## Notoboto

{% codeberg jcolag/Notoboto %}

The initial semantic index for my notes finally completed during the week---taking about a week and a half, slightly better than the two weeks that I predicted...well, [two weeks ago]({% post_url 2025-12-15-bill-rights %})---so I have added that initial script to the repository, in case anybody wants to mess around with it.

It doesn't do anything particularly interesting---iterates through the notes, and for new files, gets the embedding for "interesting" lines, and stashes them in the database---so I didn't comment it, other to provide an example of a query using the [SQLite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) extension.  It does assume that you use some infrastructure such **Notoboto**, getting location information out of the configuration file.

## Next

Right now, I notice that **SaLaVI** has some bugs that I should run down, though nothing that affects normal play.  And I have the companion script to the initial semantic search index started, but need to actually fill in the part where it updates the index.  I would also like to modify the index to handle multiple sources of notes, since I...have multiple sources of notes.
