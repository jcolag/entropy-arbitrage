As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...the ruling class fears, as it always has, the masses being taught true history. They fear youth discovering their humanity and love for revolutionary change. They are terrified of a new world with a new set of ethics based on the priorities of people's humanity as opposed to property interests based on racism, materialism, militarism, corporate greed, and oligarchy.

What?  Another institution of policing that, purely coincidentally, has its roots in racism and protecting capital from humans?  You don't say...

 > Runaways tended to settle in areas that were intentionally difficult to access, like remote swampy or mountainous terrain. Houses and other shelters often consisted of semipermanent structures so that Maroons could relocate as needed to avoid detection.

Hashtags:  #Slavery #Archaeology

I imagine that we'll find many more of these as the technology improves.  Western society has always had an urge to hide evidence of uprisings, so what we know could only barely scratch the surface of the actual escapees.

 > Imagine public school teachers, librarians, nurses, or child care workers being offered $50,000 bonuses and on-the-spot hiring. If there‚Äôs a bottomless well of taxpayer funds for waging war on people, there ought to be plenty of money to spend in service of them.

Hashtags:  #ICE #PublicSafety

I especially like this article for refusing to give up on the idea of good governance, since half the Republican play-book involves discrediting things that a functioning democracy can use.  Look to Trump's selective use of antitrust law, for example, intent on making regulating and protecting the market look like corruption.  We need to fight the bad aspects of this agenda, while making sure that we don't try to dispose of the good parts of the system.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw White Supremacists %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Active Clubs are white supremacy‚Äôs new, dangerous frontier](https://theconversation.com/active-clubs-are-white-supremacys-new-dangerous-frontier-262786) from The Conversation

 > The clubs‚Äô rise reflects a broader [shift in white supremacist strategy](https://theweek.com/politics/white-supremacy-active-clubs-far-right), away from formal organizations and social movements. In 2020, American neo-Nazi [Robert Rundo](https://www.justsecurity.org/87970/amid-robert-rundos-extradition-the-white-supremacist-active-clubs-network-remains-a-threat/) introduced the concept of ‚Äú[White Nationalism 3.0](https://americangerman.institute/video/white-supremacy-3-0/)‚Äù ‚Äì a decentralized, branded and [fitness-based approach](https://www.vice.com/en/article/neo-nazi-fight-clubs-robert-rundo-fat-shaming-white-nationalism/) to extremist organizing.

I thought that people reported on this, probably under a different name that I've forgotten, around a decade ago.  But regardless, it goes to show how the far right loves to find real problems and use them as "bait" to entrap young men.

 > And then the social media algorithms finish the job. YouTube, TikTok, Discord, and podcasts are powerful pipelines for conservative and reactionary content aimed squarely at young men. Algorithms reward edgy, contrarian voices that frame liberal politics as humorless, authoritarian, or emasculating. Democrats, meanwhile, have failed to counterprogram in these spaces, leaving right-wing influencers free to dominate the conversation among disaffected young men.

In fairness, people across the political spectrum have spent decades blaming the Democrats for every harmful thing that any Republican does, probably the best marketing campaign in recent history, given that nobody has identified it as artificial sentiment...
