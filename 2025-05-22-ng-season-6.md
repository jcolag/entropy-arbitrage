## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Next Generation Season 6 Summary

I don't think that I have anything particularly interesting to say about this season---though I do note that the show does *seem* to want to change direction slightly and improve some of its characters---so let's jump right in...

## Conclusions

As I did with the original cast seasons, unlike the discussions of individual episodes, I'll skip the judgment calls and instead break everything down by field of practice.

Before we get moving, as usual, I feel it worth a reminder that *Star Trek* doesn't show our future.  We see deviations in the timeline, especially when the writers try to predict their futures.  I won't collect them---many people have picked apart the franchise timeline and decided how to resolve the contradictions, including the studio itself---but I wanted to make that point clear early.

### Training and Professionalism

People pressed for time would rather explain how they don't have time and need to reschedule the conversation than they would to answer closed-form questions[^TA].

Workers have an obligation to report their every observation, but managers reflexively dismiss those observations if they seem strange[^RF].

They consider work, including the work of exploration, boring[^TQ].  Perhaps related, nobody seems to care about safety, even reproducing reckless experiments in heavily used areas[^RF], assuming that some technology will take care of it for them[^RF], or let a technical breakthrough eclipse the consequences of failure[^R] [^FD].  They also seem to dismiss the utility of administrative work[^MP].  And at least some people don't prepare for their work[^R] [^QL] [^FM] [^SC], believe that others should take time out of their work to educate them on information that they can readily look up[^QL] [^TS], or play games instead of attending to their duties[^SB] [^SC] and pulling others from their duties to fix their gaming problems[^SB] or betting on the outcomes[^SB].  Some do object to that lazy behavior, though[^C1], a view seen as poor leadership or insecurity[^C1], though outsiders see this lax behavior as lazy and foolish[^RH].

We continue to see a strongly hierarchical culture, where people with more status feel more entitled[^RF] [^Ra] [^T] [^L] [^SC], they largely ignore visitors with lower status[^RF] [^T] or can reassign them without consultation[^L], and people with extremely high status can spout gibberish without any question or criticism[^QL] or pressure "friends" into spending personal time with them and validate their emotions[^L].  Starfleet, at least, actively litigates officers who disobey immoral orders[^QL].

A lot of management seems to involve finding a colleague to pawn off employee problems[^RF] [^R], to make time for the work that the manager enjoys[^R].  They also still believe that leadership derives from aggression, loudly demanding that workers move faster[^Ra] or other bullying[^FE] [^D].  Some also see their managerial jobs as manipulating people[^SC].

Taking credit for the work or ideas of colleagues seems ordinary[^S].

While Starfleet itself appears to have a poor reputation among Federation civilians[^T], many officers find it offensive to not receive respect for their positions[^T].  They also see violence as a route to proving their bravery[^T].

At least intellectually if not emotionally, they understand that a personal relationship doesn't need to impact a professional relationship, provided that they act in a professional manner[^L].  Possibly because of that, Starfleet has no current regulations or guidelines for leaders having romantic relationships with their subordinates[^L]  However, they also seem to think that professionalism comes from overcompensating, rather than setting up objective criteria and some level of auditing of decisions[^L].  They also find it entirely reasonable to embarrass their colleagues in public[^SC].

### Economics

The Federation appears to prioritize commerce, even on distant shipping routes, over avoiding wars[^MP].  Labor paid in experience might make up a significant part of the workforce[^TQ].

Space travel seems dangerous enough that a missing ship doesn't raise much attention[^R].

Centralized manufacturing produces many products[^TQ], seemingly with poor quality assurance[^TQ].

Communities seem to build casinos near local Starfleet facilities[^T].

### Science and Technology

Devices come with exaggerated technical specifications for which few people verify the data[^R].

It appears that the culture largely works to avoid polluting environments, to a degree that they find the idea of cleaning up pollution absurd[^TQ].  However, they also see nature as something to exploit and tame[^TQ].

People with status can take important artifacts from archaeological digs for their personal collections[^Ra] [^C].

Nobody seems to see science as useful unless it produces results that they can immediately use for its intended purpose, dismissing anything that doesn't reach that bar as a failure[^Su].

#### Design

User interfaces continue to make no sense, with the computer requiring specific temperatures for serving water[^RF] and unable to guess at a variety of table[^S].  Likewise, the computer continues to not report when important conditions arise[^S] [^A].  Systems meant for children, however, provide more guidance to users[^Ra].

Computer security doesn't seem to have anything like a threat model[^FD] and allows anybody to unlock locked files and run them[^SB].  Even in physical space, somebody can claim an important space[^B1] or take down entire systems for hours[^L] to use them for side-projects.

They have finally decided to make it more difficult to let holodecks kill people[^D].

#### Health Care

Admitting to experiencing fear can endanger one's career, both administratively and through souring personal relationships.  Therapists recommend overcoming fear by fighting through[^RF].

More generally, therapy seems to ignore the patient when possible and recommend the patient's own ideas[^RF], often veering into giving destructive advice[^L] [^FM].  The practice also doesn't seem to have anything like an obligation of confidentiality[^C1].  However, a change may have begun, with occasional attempts to actually help the patient[^B1] [^C] [^TS] [^D].

Starfleet's therapists seem to have actual medical training[^TS].

The use of branded drugs continues[^MP].  They also continue to use ableist terminology to describe things that they dislike[^C] [^FM], suggesting a stigma to disability.

#### Academia

People feel ashamed for admitting an interest in science[^Ra].  Likewise, they dismiss the importance or enjoyment of learning about new ideas[^B1], and find it objectionable to not have information presented to them as entertainment[^TS].

Schools consider Latin an important subject[^Ra], though people find technical jargon too confusing[^B1].

Some don't seem capable or interested in reading silently[^SC].

The idea of telling time without a mechanical or electronic clock seems fully lost[^TS].

#### Food and Drink

They now primarily drink synthehol[^R], which heavy drinkers dislike[^R].

### Crime

Many automatically associate crime with non-humans[^A].

### Government, Law, and Corrections

Many seem to identify with police officers and support their work in general.  However, when police work inconveniences them, they support violence against those same officers[^TA].

They have an understanding that torture of prisoners doesn't provide useful information[^C2].

Policing appears to allow intimidating suspects in interrogations with nobody present to protect their civil liberties[^A], but insist that it works as part of a fair process[^A].

Starfleet appears to have a bad reputation inside the Federation[^FE].

They seem to favor vigilante justice, setting a bomb on ship crewed by thieves[^SM] and don't seem interested in following up on evidence and confession of a murder committed during an illegal espionage mission[^FM].

### Ethics

Many see defectors as irredeemable[^FE].

Cheating at games seems routine, especially against people from other cultures[^T].

### Religion

Picard continues to show some evidence that he follows some sanitized Christian-like religion[^C].

### Family

Despite having strained family relationships, many strongly believe that people in the Federation have especially strong family ties in contrast to other cultures[^Ra], despite those other cultures also displaying those ties and feeling that those ties separate them from the Federation[^C2].

Some also show bitter rivalries in families, even with previously unknown members of the family[^SC].

#### Gender Roles

Everybody seems to find sexuality in aging women threatening[^MP].  They (still) don't, however, seem to see any problem with dating people much younger with far less power or experience[^TQ] [^B2], though they do draw the line at minors[^Ra].

While men enjoy boasting about sex, they also reliably flee when a companion shows an interest in reciprocating[^MP] [^TQ].  Many men, though, take up womanizing ways, hiding relationships from other partners[^T].  Many seem to believe that sex destroys friendships[^T].

They treat jealous rages in relationships as routine[^MP].

Men obsess about their physical strength[^MP] [^QL].  They see violence as necessary to defend a woman's "honor" if someone suggests that they might sexually assault a woman[^T].  They find it beneath their dignity, however, to speak openly about their emotions[^T] [^B2].

People appear to support and enjoy older people making sexist comments[^R].  Other people express similar sentiments[^S], and in fact find sexual harassment funny[^TS], with nobody pointing out the problem[^S] [^TQ] [^TS].  They also carry an expectation of women handling emotional labor[^S].  And they enjoy shaming women for not enjoying specific sciences[^L].

Men act extremely vain, looking to perfect their hair and clothes[^Ra] [^QL], but insist that they do it to project power, rather than out of vanity[^QL].  Many men also find it interesting or important to control the appearance of women[^QL] or suggest that they would need trickery to get through their careers[^FM].

Parents find it completely inappropriate to expose children to women in even modest undergarments[^FD].

Women learn to apologize for opposing attacks against them[^QL].

Media favored by women seems treated as less important[^A].  They also seem to find it appropriate to lecture women on small matters that they can definitely figure out for themselves[^L] and to dismiss the evidence that they uncover of a crime[^Su].

Everybody continues to hide their healthiest relationships from their colleagues[^L] [^SC].

Women can have some authority, but only over empty spaces where they have decided that such leadership has the lowest importance of all current tasks[^D].

#### Race Relations and Nationalism

People appear to support and enjoy older people making racist comments[^R].  Other people express similar sentiments, including making patronizing comments to Black women[^S] and instructing other Black people how to behave[^A], or otherwise spreading stereotypes about non-humans[^D], sometimes with a mild disclaimer that they didn't want that to offend anybody[^D].  They also find it amusing to mock foreign accents[^TS].

Humans who develop special abilities face significant discrimination[^TQ], as do other outsiders[^QL] [^A] [^RH], often wishing that they could find a community of their own kind[^QL].  Many seem to lean into stereotypes[^B1] [^RH] or feel reluctant to open up about their personal issues[^B1], though we see some signs of wanting to reject that way of living[^B2].

People from disadvantaged backgrounds experience pressure to believe that they found joy in their suffering[^Ra].  A common belief also seems to exist that ethnicity defines culture, rather than their associations[^B1], with suggestions that outcasts or unique individuals don't have a culture of their own[^B1].

Many associate crime with non-humans[^A], and find violence in their non-human colleagues something to immediately worry about[^D].  They'll also happily use their non-human friends as buffers in awkward social situations[^SM], use their non-white friends as weapons[^SM], or blame their non-human friends for strange combat resolutions[^C].  They also see no problems rounding up all non-citizens to take biometric data[^C] or speaking ill of their non-human colleagues[^RH].

#### International Relations

Outsiders identify the Federation's behavior as imperial[^TA] [^C] or weak and foolish[^FE].

Many find the idea of treating people from certain cultures, such as the Ferengi, with even minimal respect objectionable[^RF], and find it completely implausible that they (or Klingons) might have an interest in science[^Su].  They also use the Romulans as a shorthand for a lack of morality[^C1] and would rather jump to violence than sit near a Romulan ship[^FE] [^TS], presuming that they want to use any distress or camaraderie as a pretext for attack[^TS].  Many seem to want to provoke a war with the Cardassians[^C2], blaming them for all damage done during their previous war[^C2].  Many also regret not committing genocide against the Borg[^D].  We see many of these stereotypes directly contradicted in personal interactions with representatives from those cultures[^FE] [^C] [^Su] [^TS], and some have started to reject the hatred[^B2].

They seem comfortable with people covering up murders, if the investigation might cause international attention[^Su], and don't seem at all interested in the fate of foreigners who have mysteriously vanished before their eyes[^TS].  They also see no issues with claiming a foreigner's idea as their own, after rephrasing it slightly[^TS].

Local sovereignty continues to get stomped on when someone has their ego at stake[^MP], and they genuinely enjoy exerting dominance over people from other cultures[^Ra] [^C2] [^A] [^T] [^C] [^TS] [^D].  Similarly, they'll ignore important diplomatic initiatives to deal with personal concerns[^C].  That includes lecturing representatives of other cultures on how they should manage their internal affairs[^C2].  Likewise, they'll happily make promises that they can't keep to local governments, and consider running[^TQ] or ignoring the consequences[^SB] when they fail.

We also see a refusal to acknowledge the existence of anything smaller than a unified global government[^FM].

They also treat representatives of other cultures as having no autonomy or thoughts beyond uncritically following leaders[^FE].  Cheating doesn't seem to count when used to beat such representatives in games[^T].

Likewise, people assume that new cultures must have hostile intent in their interactions[^S] [^FE] [^FM] [^TS] [^D], blocking the escape of attackers who have realized their mistakes[^D] and hiding sidearms inside their computer consoles[^SB], though we have started to see at least some resistance to the idea of solving every intergovernmental problem with threats and/or violence[^C2].  Threats of violence also motivate them to help, at least when the perpetrator presents as white and male[^SB].

The Federation doesn't have an accepted definition of life, making its recognition a judgment call, expecting novel forms of life to prove their value[^QL] [^SB], otherwise viewing it as property to exploit and sacrifice[^QL] [^SB] or as a potential problem to avoid[^SB].  They seem far more interested in determining how to recreate these emergent consciousnesses than helping them[^SB].

Opposition to warmongering mostly limits itself to not wanting to make the decision to wage war[^C1].

The Federation government needs only the shallowest rumor to begin an espionage campaign against rival powers[^C1] and possibly massacres[^C2], similarly using their unproven hypotheses to justify espionage against smaller governments[^FM].  They also don't seem to see secretly causing borders to break somebody out of prison as an act that might cause diplomatic problems[^C2].  And in some cases, they'll happily cover up war crimes for political expediency[^B2].

News that all the major powers descend from a common ancestor doesn't seem to affect relations with those powers[^C].

### Popular Culture

Shakespeare continues to have a central role in their conception of culture, apparently believing that his plays would have wide appeal and strong demand in the United States[^TA].

At least some people also think of French folk songs as important[^C2].  They also show a fondness for popular pieces of classical music[^L].

A form of literature called a Gothic novel---no word about its relationship to how we would use the term---has become popular, though seems dismissed by many with privilege[^A], seemingly due to gender connotations.

Other modern literature does seem to exist, if mostly in obscurity[^FM].

#### Socialization

Regardless of the evidence, many believe that their society has eliminated poverty, despair, and cruelty[^TA].

They seem to believe that older people have nothing to contribute to society[^R].  Similarly, they have trouble imagining somebody who looks like a child with the ability to lead[^Ra].

Jockeying for superiority seems to occupy a lot of attention[^TQ].  And probably related, they despise gregarious colleagues for their ability to carry on conversations that they can't put to immediate use[^SM].  Similarly, they value a person's productivity over their life[^L].

People consider armed violence age-appropriate for children, but not seeing women in modest undergarments[^FD].  They also see violence as a viable distraction to enact a separate plan.

At least those with high status don't believe that they have any responsibility to protect others[^T], and believe that changes to their personal history could have altered the galaxy[^T].  They would also rather die than give up their status[^T].  Meanwhile, others praise those with high status, using them as paragons of morality[^Su].

They show an unhealthy attachment to the meaning of their artificial day/night cycles[^L], and seem to crave constant stimulation[^TS].

#### Fashion

The culture and educational system appear to have greatly romanticized and sanitized the American frontier[^FD].

#### History

They seem to propagate highly romanticized versions of especially American history[^FD].

Come back in a week, when go back to playing with Hugh and pretending that we care about Data's "new" emotions, in part 2 of *Descent*...
