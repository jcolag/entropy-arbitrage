This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads the second half (so far) of **Grey Sky**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Grey Sky**
 * Location:  <https://greysky.neocities.org/>
 * Released:  2014 -- 2018, 2024 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Yabo "Yalyn" Vinkindo
 * Medium:  Web Comic
 * Length:  Approximately fifty page so far
 * Content Advisories:  Violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Grey Sky

The comic's *about* page describes it as follows.

> Grey Sky is a Free Culture webcomic series created by Yabo "Yalyn" Vinkindo.
>
> The webcomics are created with Free/Open Source software in Linux OS and is published in [Copyleft license.](https://greysky.neocities.org/copyleft)
>
> The first comic was published around June 1st 2014.
>
> It was put on hiatus on May 31st 2018.
>
> Around August 2024, webcomic project is slowly coming back from the dead.
>
> For further updates, go to [https://mastodon.art/@Yalyn](https://mastodon.art/@Yalyn)

I can confirm that the creator indeed posts updates to the Fediverse regularly, which has kept me anxious to see what the comic actually has to offer.

## What Works Well?

You can see the comic becoming more self-assured as it goes, in this section, with improvements to the looks of the characters and an increasing number of jokes that readers will probably find understandable.

It also appears that the story has (finally?) gotten around to dealing with its paranormal aspects that the introduction promised us served as a central aspect of the world.  And it sets up an interesting mystery.  And maybe it, along with the difference in culture[^1], has some chance of explaining the romance subplot that has completely baffled me in trying to get one of the participants to...participate.

[^1]:  Apart from the vague sense that the creator might not natively speak English, due to some quirky turns of phrase, this run of the comic suggests more directly suggests another culture through the lives of the characters, such as the decided preference for book stores over libraries, and adults taking gym class, which seem completely alien to me.

Finally, I found the handling of the hiatus done well, here, celebrating the return instead of wasting time on self-flagellation for delays.  I never liked the excuse-riddled approach, especially since most readers probably come to these projects later in the run, when a seven-year gap usually manifests more like a sudden jump in quality than anything else.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Other than minor issues that I mentioned last week---much of which has, as I mentioned, steadily improved, I can't really find much to mention.  The comics run shorter than the early installments, so we have significantly less of it, but I suspect that has a lot to do with the improved quality.

## Opportunities

The comic does have a [support](https://greysky.neocities.org/support.html) page, which includes the following.

> It's been a long time that I've denied donations. I've now opened it back up if you really want to support me.
>
> However, please understand that I have a full-time job which means that my webcomic project can range from being slow to really slow.
>
> If possible, sharing my work, translating my work or maybe even sending a nice comment to me (via Mastodon) would be wonderful.
>
> But if you want to donate to me then I have [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Yalyn/) and [Ko-fi.](https://ko-fi.com/yalyn)

And then a bunch of other Free Culture projects, many of which have shown up or will show up in these posts.  And on that list, it would appear that I have the creator of this comic to thank for making [**Project Ballad**]({% post_url 2023-07-29-project-ballad-1 %}).

## What's Adaptable?

The **Moonlight Warrior** and **Under the Silent Stars** films seems original to this, though possibly inspired by songs.  A novel also gets a mention, but I found many with the same name in different languages, so without more information, I assume that they must have meant one of them.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll read **Violent Nemorous Passage**, an adventure for a role-playing game that I gather had a recent release.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
