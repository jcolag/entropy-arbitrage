{% cw I'll need to talk about US Politics, Epstein, wars, and more; you've seen the news... %}

I wanted to quickly contextualize recent news, because things have started to feel out of control to a lot of people, and it seemed worth a mention, even if that meant a short but late[^LdSQNR] Sunday post.

[^LdSQNR]:  I meant to start writing this a few days ago, but kept getting derailed, so it became a Sunday morning rush...

![A red, tentacled monster excreting slime, chewing a credit card, and grabbing cash](/blog/assets/oli-maia-extra-004.png "Not a metaphor that I expected, but sure...")

On Friday, this spurred me to post a version of [the following comment](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/115867555204017249) on Mastodon.  I'll expand after.

## Looking at the News

Remember, Trump's actions have two main goals.

- Get people to stop talking about he and Epstein.  
- Make everyone feel as impotent as all his people do, and get us to fight each other, so that they can feel in control.

Think of the entire group like wounded animals, dangerous as they lash out, but they don't work from a place of strength.

## Recap

Everything here really happened (or mostly escalated) in about a week, if you can believe it.

### Epstein

About a week ago, the Department of Justice admitted that they had only [released less than one percent of the Epstein files](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.826.0.pdf), "125,575 pages" out of "more than 2 million documents," so probably much less than half of one percent, in reality, assuming that most documents have more than one page.  If you think that through a bit more deeply, the admission seems pretty damning.

After all, from the DoJ dumps, we have gotten firm evidence of wrongdoing[^40Ft7L], including Trump spending a *lot* of time on his private jet with he, Ghislaine Maxwell, and at least one young woman, and a letter from Epstein (after Trump's first election) stating that "our President" loves "young nubile girls."  Revelations from the files released by the Epstein estate through Congressional Democrats have finally taken down Larry Summers, and have connected the scandal to Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and the Kremlin, not to mention that horrifying outline of a young girl's body that Trump sent to Epstein with his birthday greetings.

[^40Ft7L]:  We have *not* seen any direct evidence of illegal activity, but in politics, we don't always need that to make the necessary point.

Given that people in charge at the Department of Justice have made it fairly clear that they see themselves working on behalf of Trump, rather than the country, then we can assume that the hundred thousand pages don't represent anything like the worst of the material.  We have a hundred times that remaining, plus whatever the Democrats have held in reserve.  We don't know if any of it has specific evidence of criminal acts.  And if it does, we don't know if we can trust them to release the material.  But in some ways, that makes it worse for them, because people will fill in the remainder with the worst case.

And further given that Trump got into office, twice, at least partly based on QAnon conspiracy theories suggesting that he would finally expose everybody involved, this put him in a delightful position, where even his most faithful supporters have started slowly waking up to the possibility that maybe Il Generalaccio doesn't actually care about anything more than enriching himself.  And it didn't help when, shortly before the new year, Marjorie Taylor Greene spread the word that Trump didn't want any more Epstein documents released, because they would "hurt his friends."[^qVpocP]

[^qVpocP]:  We'll ignore the semantics of the word "friend," here, to a demographic that happily turns on anybody who can't immediately benefit them.

### Venezuela

As the Epstein scandal escalated, shortly before the Department of Justice admitted that they have much more work to do to comply with the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_Files_Transparency_Act), Trump escalated his attacks on Venezuela.  It started in September 2025 with largely anonymous bombings in the Caribbean, racking up over a hundred extrajudicial murders in the name of the War on Drugs by the end of 2025, increasingly focused on Venezuelan shipping.

On the second of January, Trump escalated that to bombing Caracas and abducting President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in an alleged arrest on drug trafficking charges---while Trump also pardons a bunch of *actual* drug traffickers including Honduran former President [Juan Orlando Hernández](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12621)---and openly stated that he did all this so that oil companies could exploit Venezuelan oil reserves.  Never mind that oil prices have started dropping as the world moves to renewable energy.  Never mind that oil executives called Venezuela "uninvestable."  He wants oil, probably because his people realize as I have that the only stable non-democracies of any significance in the modern world run on oil money.

By the way, what happened to all the people insisting that Trump would keep us out of foreign wars, unlike "Genocide Joe"?  Do they want to chime in on this issue, somewhere, maybe?  Nah, they have already pivoted to---you knew that this would hit, sooner or later---blaming Democrats for not stopping Trump.  Gosh, maybe they have an agenda that has nothing to do with opposing wars...

#### Beyond

Since invading Venezuela for oil---echoing Iraq's [invasion of Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_invasion_of_Kuwait) much more than the United States [invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), even if Trump did declare [fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-designates-fentanyl-as-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/)---didn't shake the Epstein narrative, Trump has started looking for other places to invade.  The administration has floated seizing Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and (once again) Greenland.

I would bet that, if he can get any of these rolling, then he'll start talking about cancelling elections again, something that he floated when [meeting with Zelenskyy in August](https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/president-trump-quips-about-canceling-2028-elections-if-us-is-at-war/5170008).

> So, you say during...during the war, you can't have elections. So let me just say three and a half years from now, so you mean if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections.

He says this as his party has started falling apart, polls show his approval ratings still dropping, and we have started seeing massive protests in the streets.

And speaking of Zelenskyy, don't forget that they still want to get involved in Ukraine and Gaza on the wrong side of history.

### Renee Good

Speaking of protests, that brings us to an ICE agent's [murder of Renee Good's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good) by an ICE agent, this week.  Bear in mind that ICE agents have killed thirty-two people in custody, two during raids, and one in an off-duty incident, along with seven people who they have injured in raids.  We should remember that Good's death made the news because they killed a white, suburban mother, instead of a brown person that the media wouldn't have noticed.

And the agent in this case filmed *himself* shooting her from a safe distance, under no threat, and insulting her, making it abundantly clear that he didn't do this to defend himself.

#### Thin ICE

Now, I don't want to suggest that Trump orchestrated this single, specific murder to nudge the news cycle away from his (and his supporters') deep involvement with a sex trafficking ring.  That sounds absurd.

However, remember that the United States created [Immigrations and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) and its parent organization, the [Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security), in 2002 and 2003.  And at the time, people said that they sounded kind of fascist, even as they expanded the definition of the United States border to extend one hundred miles into the country from actual boundaries, covering the vast majority of territory.

At the same time, the United States largely loves immigration.  We see ourselves as descendants of immigrants, and we see new immigrants as our neighbors.  Even the people who have no trouble with open racism, even the people who think that "those people" don't deserve human rights or the same status that they have, they at least see immigrants as cheap labor that needs to buy things in the community.

Since Trump came back into office, he has flooded ICE in particular with money and pushed to boost its size.  The recruitment push has included [lowering standards {% cc %}](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/as-ice-boosts-recruitment-critics-concerned-over-changes-to-hiring-and-training-standards) and using overtly racist language in its advertising.

In other words, Trump's minions have sent unqualified bigots into American cities looking for trouble, in defiance of those communities.  They probably didn't have this incident in mind, but they surely knew that something *like* this would happen.  And you can see that they came prepared to capitalize on it, talking about how Good wanted to run the agent off the road despite all evidence to the contrary.  And even if you believe your lying eyes over their word, they invite you to hate her as a lesbian, or even a woman, if you'd like.

## Back to the Point

I admit that the Trump administration has used their domestic and foreign wars to deflect from issues other than Epstein.  They have used this as cover for cutting financial aid for young children in his five least-favorite states, for example, and that barely made it to the news.  I might also throw in that Elon Musk openly turning {% x %} into a [CSAM slop factory {% cc %}](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/), this week, largely without the media noticing.  It also wouldn't surprise me if some of this goes to getting people to stop talking about the president's health, as he sprawls on every podium, slurs his words, repeats himself, and loses track of his thoughts.

Regardless, I bring this all up, because I recognize this sort of behavior.  You probably do, too, even if you haven't made the connection, yet.

As an analogy, how do we describe "cool" people?  They don't try.  They don't worry about whether you approve of their style.

In the same way, people dealing from a position of strength don't constantly look for fights.  They don't need to bully weaker people to validate their strength.

Who does that?  Well, bullies do, and I think that we all recognize that.  But---and I realize that I have used this analogy many times before---wounded and cornered animals act like this.  They puff themselves up to look more dangerous, and they lash out at anything that gets too close to them.  They live in fear, seeing everything as a potential threat.

You can see a major difference between wounded animals and awful people in rapid decline, though.  Animals attack so that you'll leave them alone.  Awful people attack so that you feel as impotent[^UO9nIA] and as threatened by everything as they do.

[^UO9nIA]:  Speaking of impotence, at some point, we also need to talk about their weird obsession with masculinity, as if they all need to convince themselves at least as much as they need to convince us.

And that finally gets to my point.  They keep trying to throw whatever they can think of at the wall, because they want to change the subject from the growing Epstein scandal, and because they want us to feel powerless to stop them as they run out of gas.
