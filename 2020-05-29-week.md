As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

(I decided to take Memorial Day off.)

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1265267190007320582) [Video Shows Georgia Cops Tried to Tase Ahmaud Arbery in 2017 While He Was Sitting in a Park](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gmdd/video-shows-georgia-cops-tried-to-tase-ahmaud-arbery-in-2017-while-he-was-sitting-in-a-park) from VICE

 > When Kanago tells him that there’s frequent gang activity in the park, Arbery asks, "Is my name tied up in any of that?" and Kanago responds that it isn’t.

It's worth pointing out that the National Gang Center says that a ["gang"](https://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/About/FAQ) is any group of young people who are identified (no mention of by whom) with a name, "are recognized *by others* as a gang," has "some permanence," and *is involved in *an elevated level* of criminal activity."  That definition would include---for example---a high school football team that let beer into a victory party one night.  If they throw around a frisbee at the park on weekends, that's "frequent gang activity."

 > The world is so busy, too, that it cannot afford to study any man's unfinished work; for the end may prove it a failure, and the world needs masterpieces.

###### Mary Antin

As mentioned last week, it feels like I've exhausted the probable in-the-public-domain quotes from Asian Americans, which was disappointing both in terms of being able to legitimately celebrate the month and in terms of how dismissive we've been of Asian immigrants that we didn't bother preserving what they wrote or said.

However, May is *also* [Jewish American Heritage Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_American_Heritage_Month), and I'm now also disappointed that I was not aware of this earlier, so this week (the first short week in a while, at that, which isn't great) attempted to rectify that.

Mary Antin wrote about her experiences trying to assimilate into the culture of the United States after immigrating from Belarus and was later an aggressive pro-immigration activist.

 > Managers should provide employees working in demanding jobs more control, and in jobs where it is unfeasible to do so, a commensurate reduction in demands.

 > He had striven, had done business, had bought love, had subjected other lives to his will, and here, all the time lay a grave, quietly waiting for him. And now, it seemed to him that he could understand why the life he had sought to rear had crumbled.

 > I think that I was born for a life of intellectual interest. I was certainly brought up for one. The day when that accident turned my mind from college to business seems to be the most unfortunate day in my life. I think that I should be much happier as a scientist or writer, perhaps.

 > The biggest emergency for which grants were requested was rent and utilities, with nearly 38% of funding requests.

Similarly, you can find hundreds of articles surprised that the majority of [CARES Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act) stimulus payments to individuals were going to strange places like food, with almost as many articles *recommending* such spending, as if people generally just forget to get the things they need to survive.

 > After Puss in Boots had won wealth and a wife for his young master did not that gentleman often fume with chagrin because the neighbors, perhaps, refused to call on the lady of the former poor miller’s son?

###### Edna Ferber

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Trump Hails “Good Bloodlines” of Henry Ford, Whose Anti-Semitism Inspired Hitler](https://theintercept.com/2020/05/22/trump-hails-good-bloodlines-henry-ford-whose-anti-semitism-inspired-hitler/) from The Intercept

 > The New York Times reported in 1922 that Ford’s importance to Hitler was very obvious. "The wall beside his desk in Hitler’s private office is decorated with a large picture of Henry Ford," the newspaper’s Berlin correspondent observed. "In the ante-chamber there is a large table covered with books, nearly all of which are a translation of a book written and published by Henry Ford."

Ford is responsible for some good ideas that we still haven't quite processed, like overpaying his employees and taking an interest in their health for business reasons.  However, he also spread conspiracy theories that incited violence and tried to convince the United States government to enter World War II on the side of the Nazis.  So, getting excited about his "bloodlines" makes a clear statement about which side of him is being praised.
