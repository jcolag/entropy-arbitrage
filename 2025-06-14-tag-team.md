This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) watches **Tag Team**.

![The film's title, rendered as graffiti on a brick wall](/blog/assets/tag-team-title.png "Oddly, no title card with the cast")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Length:  Approximately seven minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Policing

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Tag Team

The [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4DxLPyyqBE) says the following about the film.

> A squad of cartoony kids bring some color and style to their city streets with graffiti. Through dark alleyways and empty rooftops, the city is their canvas. But when the cops catch one of them in the act, it's up to the Tag Team to rescue their buddy!
>
> **TAG TEAM** is a 2D/3D hybrid - animated student film collaboration. Huge thanks to everyone who helped make Tag Team a reality!
>
> directed by Joseph Jones [⚫ / heyits_mojo](https://twitter.com/heyits_mojo&v=B4DxLPyyqBE) for more info and updates check out [⚫ / tagteamfilm](https://twitter.com/tagteamfilm&v=B4DxLPyyqBE)

I didn't bother to check if either social media feed remains active.

## What Works Well?

This will undoubtedly come down to taste, in a lot of cases, but I think that I like the style, for the most part, or at least how it seems to gesture at the film's subject.

The story also moves along nicely, helped along by the fluid animation.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

It often feels like the story could have withstood some tightening up.  For example, with everything revolving around graffiti, I would expect graffiti to somehow resolve the situation, instead of a confusing action sequence.

In fact, the story feels uncomfortable with graffiti itself.  Sometimes, it treats the kids as dangerous criminals.  Other times, it treats them as an ordinary part of their community who have a duty to fight back against law enforcement.  But it doesn't seem to want to engage with the art, the reasons for graffiti, or the reasons for criminalizing it.

## Opportunities

I don't see any way of getting involved.

## What's Adaptable?

Nothing really comes to mind, though the design of the abandoned subway station will probably get somebody's attention.

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll read NASA's **First Woman:  NASA's Promise for Humanity** comics.  They each run longer than a typical commercial comic book, so we'll take one issue (of two) over each of the next two weeks.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the film?
