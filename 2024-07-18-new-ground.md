## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## New Ground

I wonder if this episode ties into a future episode that will similarly ignore its premise...

 > Captain's log, stardate 45376.3. We are approaching the planet Bilana Three, where a new method of propulsion known as the Soliton Wave is being developed. The *Enterprise* has been asked to participate in one of the first tests of this new technology.

While the episode almost goes out of its way to make this sound like some writer made something up on a whim, [solitons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton) actually exist, a stable wave packet that travels at constant velocity through its medium and can recover after collisions.  We've known about them since at least the 1830s, which probably helps explain the quirky name.

 > **DATA**: Every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history, once it has elapsed.

Why does anybody talk to him?  They *know* that he'll do this...

Also, only nanoseconds?  Again, I find myself obliged to pedantically correct Data's pedantry, because surely, [Planck time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units)---usually defined as $$t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}$$, in case you ever need that information---would make a far more appropriate unit for "moments in history," since we define the units entirely on physical context and actually don't have even a theoretical framework to deal with shorter durations, leading some physicists to assume that no shorter spans of time (or the other dimensions that we measure, for their relevant Planck units) exist.

 > **LAFORGE**: No, no, no, no. I mean, we're going to see something that people will talk about for years. I mean, think about it. No more bulky warp engines or nacelles. A ship just generates a Soliton wave and then rides it through space like a surfboard. This is going to be like being there to watch Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, or Zephram Cochrane engage the first warp drive.

Imagine the bizarre idea of this crew watching Zephram Cochrane---who we met in [*Metamorphosis*]({% post_url 2020-10-08-meta %}), by the way---engage the first warp drive, like *that* would ever happen...

[Chuck Yeager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager), meanwhile, served as an Air Force (and Army Air Force, before that) test pilot who, indeed, broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, going to retire from the Air Force as a Brigadier General in 1975.  He'll get at least one more mention in this series, and also looms large in the inspiration for **Enterprise**, another decade in this episode's future.

 > **HELENA**: I hope you don't mind us dropping in on you like this, but when I heard the *Enterprise* was to be in this sector, we took the first transport and here we are.

Wait.  Can people...do things like that?  No plan, no paperwork, you knock on the airlock of a military vessel and hope that somebody lets you in?

 > **HELENA**: Lapsang suchong tea, please. Have you been eating? You look thin.

Helena drinks an [actual variety of tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsang_souchong), incidentally.

 > **KYLE**: Come in. Lieutenant Worf. Very nice to see you again. And you must be Alexander. I hear you'll be coming to school with us for a while? Well, we're very excited to have you with us. I know the other boys and girls will be happy to have a new classmate. First I need to get a little information from you. Let's start with your name. Alexander Rozhenko. That's a tough one. Maybe you can help me with that. Could you spell your last name for me?

You might (but probably won't) recognize Ms. Kyle as [Jennifer Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Edwards), who played the lead in the 1968 adaptation of **Heidi**.  Her history as a child actor strikes me as an interesting choice, given the episode's focus on Alexander, played by [Brian Bonsall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bonsall), then known primarily for his role on sitcom **Family Ties**, but would probably prefer that we now associate him with his musical career...

 > **WORF**: I apologize for being late, Captain. I was detained in school...I was enrolling my son in class.

Once again, let's have a quick round of applause for Michael Dorn's comedy and general acting chops.  You can actually feel it in his voice, when he realizes the ambiguity in his excuse, and his concern that Picard might use it to tease him.

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf. You are not the first officer on this ship to have a new family member. Take care of your son. The security matters can wait.

That feels almost shockingly progressive of Picard, honestly.  I would've expected him to force Worf to show up for everything until something actually fails, then angrily *order* him to take time off instead of wasting everybody's time...

 > **TROI**: Did she tell you about the father-son field trip this afternoon?

I have a better question than whether Worf had heard about it:  Why insist on a field trip with such aggressive gender and institutional norms at all?  At least around where I lived around when this aired, that sort of blatant insensitivity---parents might have died or gotten divorces, even before we get to any "woke" ideas about of sperm banks, gay parents, and any number of other permutations that arise a *lot*---would probably have gotten people fired.  It seems even worse, here, given that this show has made a big deal about worries that one accident could orphan a child at any time.

Seriously, imagine how this scene plays out for a *mother*-son field trip, or first-season Wesley wanted to go on this trip.  Would the show try to grapple with the complexity of Worf or Crusher not having the convenience (and burden) of a specific gender role in parenting?  Or would it blow off the problem---as many television shows of the era did---by having a woman in the cast serve as a temporary surrogate mother, so that we don't need to actually think about the problem that Starfleet has effectively told children of single parents that they deserve fewer educational opportunities?  This shouldn't feel so abstract on this show, when so many of the crew come from non-atomic households or lost at least one parent.

On top of that, do you really want to tell me that not a *single* girl or non-binary child on the ship wants to see a gilvo or talk about rhino extinction, today?

 > **KYLE**: As the value of their horns increased, the number of white rhinos in the wild kept falling, until they finally became extinct about two centuries ago. Now, I'd like to show you a pair of animals we're trying to save from extinction. Would you follow me? They're from Corvan Two, where their homes in the rainforests are being threatened by industrial pollutants. They're called Corvan gilvos. They're a little shy.

The [white or square-lipped rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_rhinoceros) received Near Threatened status in 2013, when scientists estimated the total population at twenty thousand individuals, largely due to the poaching for their horns that Ms. Kyle describes.  The northern subspecies may have already gone *effectively* extinct, with only two known individuals left, both in captivity and both female.

 > **WORF**: You don't know why you lied, and yet you did. You don't know why you stole, and yet you did! Alexander, come here. When I was a child, younger than you, I lost my parents, my family, my people. Everything I had was taken from me except my sense of honor. It was the one thing I had which was truly Klingon and which no-one could take away. Do you know who they are?

It seems worth pointing out, here, that this idea---of clinging to traditions and even stereotypes to feel a connection with one's heritage, not to mention the physical manifestations of that tradition later in life---holds true across a lot of disadvantaged subcultures.  Once again, it paints a bleak picture of outsiders living in the Federation.  He refers to losing his family, but when he talks about something that "no-one could take away," he also means his language, his culture, probably his personal possessions, his favorite foods, and more, because in this context, he can't *not* mean those things.

However, it also gestures at an aspect of Worf's character that we don't necessarily care about for these posts, but some people might want to consider:  He has built up an imagined version of Klingon culture revolving entirely around honorable actors that we haven't seen in evidence anywhere.  Despite their biker-Viking-samurai aesthetic, much like the Klingons in the original series, they mostly stand around making snarky remarks about masculinity, when they don't have an overblown scheme to underhandedly gain power in the government.

Anyway, the idea of Worf clinging to stereotypes, because the Federation tried to bully his heritage out of him, goes a long way to explaining his refrain of explaining that it *should* take extra effort to discipline Klingon children, so I won't bring that nonsense up elsewhere in the post.  We saw something similar in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), where the title character has deliberately taken on the aspects of her culture most incompatible with the Federation, though she seems to have done it more as a political statement than defense mechanism, since it began recently.  It might also help to explain Data, Troi, and many of the one-shot non-human officers that we've seen, who all seem to do asinine things to remind everybody of their alien-ness.

 > **ALEXANDER**: Kahless?
 >
 > **WORF**: And his brother, Morath. They fought for twelve days and twelve nights because Morath had broken his word and brought shame to his family. When you lie or steal, you not only dishonor yourself, but your family. You dishonor me.

A quick aside that has nothing to do with Federation culture:  I don't know if that actually looks like a *fight*.  And Klingon culture would seem so much more interesting if they built their entire culture on Kahless and his boyfriend getting it on in a two-week vacation...

 > **LAFORGE**: Energy transfer is ninety-eight percent!
 >
 > **RIKER**: Ninety-eight?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Yes, sir. There's less than a two percent energy loss between the wave and the ship.

Yes, one hundred, minus two, makes ninety-eight.  I like that La Forge apparently thinks that he needs to explain arithmetic to Riker.  Does the first officer have trouble borrowing one from the next column...?

 > **DATA**: That is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than our own warp drive.

Sure, but you would *expect* something like that, no?  The experiment can generate power at a planetary level, and---generally speaking---the bigger power plant generates power more efficiently.  This matters in our world, for example, because it means that an electric vehicle will waste significantly less energy than an internal combustion engine doing the same work, even if your electricity comes from coal, though not a factor of four, more like a difference of thirty percent, if I remember the calculations.  A power plant has a maximum efficiency that depends on its size, for thermodynamic reasons.

By the way, this discussion seems to say something about the economics of space-travel, such as its expense, if anybody cares about efficiency at all.  Also, though, the way that La Forge made such a big deal about this technology makes me think about its uses, because this doesn't seem to have any use to Starfleet.  If you need somebody to send you on your way and somebody to receive you, then you can't explore space or conduct military actions.  However, something like this would revolutionize civilian travel and shipping, creating the interstellar equivalent of railroads.

 > **KYLE**: And he seems to still have difficulty telling the truth. He takes toys from other the other students and then denies taking them. He acts like a bully and then says someone else started the fight. And he's bluntly told me you said Klingons do not listen to teachers.

Granted, I have never run a space-primary-school, but it seems to me that the bullying anecdote goes at the start or the end of the story, not buried in the middle where everybody will forget about it immediately and move onto another topic.  You make bullying the headline, not a loose relationship with honesty.

 > **JA'DAR**: Commander, at that energy level, the wave will not only destroy the colony, it'll take most of the planet with it.

And did nobody question this possibility when Ja'dar pitched this project?

Wait, I have something for this, don't I?  Yes, in [*11001001*]({% post_url 2022-08-25-11001001 %})'s post, I cited [*That's No Moon*](https://journals.le.ac.uk/index.php/pst/article/view/1956), which estimates (on the order of) 10<sup>27</sup> joules to destroy an Earth-like planet[^1], figure that "most of the planet" equates to roughly the same value.  They say that the wave will reach the destination with a factor of two hundred more energy than expected, so that tells us that the *intended* energy came to somewhere in the neighborhood of 10<sup>25</sup> joules.

[^1]:  Oddly, I don't see where they draw that conclusion, despite listing it in the abstract.  They cite the 10<sup>32</sup> value, but since that overcomes the [gravitational binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_binding_energy) of the planet---which you can confirm by calculating $$U = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$$, and who would've guessed that *this* post would spur me to work out how to render math nicely, with two equations...?---that looks more like disintegration than plain old destruction, which would certainly take orders of magnitude less power.

What does *that* look like?  Well, the asteroid impact that created the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) released around 10<sup>23</sup> joules, or a hundred times *less* than they deliberately aimed at a colony.  Imagine forming one hundred Gulfs of Mexico in rapid succession where we used to have a city, and you get the general idea.  Or if you don't like that, the Earth receives 10<sup>24</sup> joules of energy from the Sun every year, so you could instead imagine concentrating a decade's worth of solar energy into a single sunbeam.

I wonder if that explains Starfleet's interest.  We've seen since at least [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %}) that Starfleet has an interest in quietly snapping up new weapons under other pretexts, such as amateur archaeology, and if we read an episode like [*A Matter of Perspective*]({% post_url 2023-08-03-matter-perspective %}) even mildly cynically, they do sometimes fund useless-looking civilian technologies that happen to have potential as weapons.  And a way to aim 10<sup>25</sup> joules---again, the likely intended power, not the version raging out of control---at a planet many light years away with no loss of energy certainly looks like a potential weapon to me.

Regardless, it occurs to me that this ties back to [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}), when we find out that Louis has permission to accidentally create a super-volcano in the Atlantic Ocean, since they approved his project without a plan to prevent ruptures to the Earth's mantle.

 > **TROI**: Do you think he felt abandoned? After all, he left very soon after K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother, he lost his father as well.

When did Troi start doing her actual job?  First Picard and now her...

 > **RIKER**: Primary control's shorted out.

Honestly, a society that puts all their doors on *only* computer control pretty much deserves to die in a fire, because literally this will absolutely happen every single time that you have an emergency...

 > **ALEXANDER**: My leg hurts. I'm scared.

Riker's disappointment, standing there with his dinky pipe sitting there, after Worf has done all the difficult work, entertains me far more than I think that it should.

 > **ALEXANDER**: I accept your challenge, Father. I will stay.

I'll bet that you didn't remember this show having a sitcom-trained kid around, either.  Don't worry, the writers will mostly forget about him, too...

## Conclusions

We find out that the white rhino didn't survive, but lasted longer than we might expect in 2024.

### The Good

To his credit, for once, Picard compassionately tells an employee to take time off to take care of their family.

Troi has also inexplicably begun doing her job.

### The Bad

Data still finds it appropriate to incorrectly correct the casual comments of his colleagues.

We see a lot of evidence that Federation society treats outsiders cruelly, with Worf and Alexander both showing a lack of trust of peers and authority figures.  The self-application of stereotypes in minority communities that we often see seems connected to it, using those tropes to construct an identity that unwelcoming majority groups can't break through.

Federation schools strictly enforce gender roles and heteronormative nuclear family structures by arranging role-exclusive events for students.  Schools also consider bullying fellow students a far less important offense than dishonesty.

Certain high-ranking officials need somebody to work out subtraction for them.  Such officials also feel extremely disappointed when they don't get to play the heroic role in a story.

The episode seems to imply that Starfleet's interest in the soliton wave technology might relate to its destructive power, assigning the fleet's alleged flagship to observe an experiment that (even ignoring the glitch) directs enough information at inhabited sites to kill many millions of people.

Not only do user interfaces continue to confound everyone, but people install fully automated doors that a person can't open unless the computer agrees.

### The Weird

It appears that civilians visit Starfleet installations, including starships, by stopping by and casually asking for entry.

## Next

Come back in a week, when some kid will need one of our officers to act as a father figure---but not this episode---in *Hero Worship*.
