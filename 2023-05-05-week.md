As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Back [when I posted to Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}), I often tried to get this point across to, especially, the misogynist types, though it applies to racism in exactly the same way:  We look at a world that deliberately and systematically worked to exclude women from mainstream society, see the lack of (credited) achievement by women, and assume that women have less capacity to handle it.  And they do have less capacity...but only after they've overcome all the obstacles to getting involved in the first place.

Hashtags:  #RIP #HarryBelafonte

Over the years, I've watched Belafonte act in films, listened to (and purchased) many of his albums, and followed his activism.  It doesn't seem to matter what field he touched, he put in the work to become good at it.

Other articles that expand the picture of Belafonte:

 * [‚ÄòJamaica Farewell': Harry Belafonte passes away and the Caribbean tries to find adequate words of tribute](https://globalvoices.org/2023/04/26/jamaica-farewell-harry-belafonte-passes-away-and-the-caribbean-tries-to-find-adequate-words-of-tribute/) from Global Voices,

 * [The Artist Who Taught Me About Justice](https://otherwords.org/the-artist-who-taught-me-about-justice) from OtherWords.

I have to admit that a pretty big part of me resents how news of Belafonte's death lasted for *maybe* a day in the mainstream, as compared to the likes of Betty White or even Bob Saget, neither nearly as broadly talented nor as prominent outside their craft.

Hashtags:  #Education #LGBTQ

I should make the point, here, that they don't *only* target teachers from gender and sexual minorities.  They will absolutely attack the male teacher who wears too much pink, anybody unmarried, women teaching physical education, and any other person they can associate with a stereotype.  And they want to do this to send a message to students, pushing them back into the closet.

One of the more obnoxious "tropes" that I see on social media, these days, gets to issues like this, where someone will post something like, "stop trivializing these issues by calling them culture wars."  I find it offensive, because one side certainly *fights* this like a war, attacking weak positions (school boards) to disrupt connections, and maybe we should stop pretending that calling it a war over culture trivializes it and look more at the strategy to stop it.

He claims that he has oversight, but given what we've seen in the Supreme Court, I don't have much faith in the lower courts at all, at this point, especially judges appointed under certain administrations.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Yet somehow exorbitant food prices that people have little choice but to pay are still climbing, contributing disproportionately to painfully high inflation from the United States and Europe to the struggling countries of the developing world.

A heck of a coincidence that, after a year of companies assuring us that the prices reflected the market---while also telling investors that they had made record profits by becoming "good at pricing" to go with the inflation story---wouldn't reduce prices, now that their costs have gone down...

I've said something like this since at least junior high school.  I used to spend a lot of times at the public library throughout school, and it never failed to strike me how many "bad" students that you could find sitting in various corners and nooks, taking comprehensive notes from piles of books on subjects that actually interested them.  As much as I appreciate my education, the schools definitely failed those students.

 > Using social media puts you in this state because you are constantly evaluating different types of text, photo and video posts from so many different people.

I've told you since the start of this blog that [social media deliberately wears you down to make you more gullible]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %}), so I like to see research confirming that analysis, even if it doesn't get to how hate speech figures in.
