As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In a school thatâ€™s one special educator short, the other special educators have to take over that caseload. Instead of having 12 students on their caseload, maybe now they have 20. So, the amount of individual attention given to each student with a disability decreases.

Hashtags:  #Education #Disability

While I don't have a large sample set, I'd also add that, in my experience, the special education teachers did a lot of the work of making my schools feel like a community.  They all seemed to make a point of getting to know *everybody*, and could put almost anybody at ease, despite what amounts to an adult stranger randomly striking up a conversation.

 > All the dollars in circulation today are the result of this national debt. If the US government didn't have a debt, there would be no dollars in circulation.

Hashtags:  #Economy #Taxation

Exactly.  The United States government---like most governments---creates money.  We don't have taxes to pay for services.  We have taxes, because money behaves non-linearly (a billionaire acts far more wealthy than a thousand millionaires, who each act far more wealthy than people who only have thousands of dollars), and taxation brings that excess utility down.

 > For the first time ever, the conservative legal movement is explicitly claiming the state has a right to your future pregnanciesâ€”because without them, their political power will be reduced.

Hashtags:  #Abortion #USPol

You read that right.  Republican-led states demand the right to force people to give birth---including, for example, forcing pre-teens to give birth to their molesters' children---because people have begun leaving those states in such numbers (I wonder why...) that they worry about losing seats in the House of Representatives.  Instead of changing their politics to attract people, they'd rather set up breeding camps, to pile up warm bodies that goose their census numbers.

 > The SNAP program acts as a stabilizer on a wobbly economy during a downturn because it puts money in peopleâ€™s pockets to buy more food, generating income for agriculture industries and creating more jobs. A few years ago, its economic multiplier effect was gauged at producing $1.54 billion for every $1 billion invested.

Hashtags:  #Inequality #USPol #Vote

While I said this in my [Sunday post on the election]({% post_url 2024-10-27-project-2025 %}), it bears repeating:  If you have trouble motivating yourself to vote, then vote on behalf of somebody whose voices we don't generally hear, because one political party goes to extraordinary lengths to silence them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > According to the UN, in 2014, more than twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, over 600,000 people across the post-Soviet space still remained stateless. One of them was Elena Dergunov, a resident of ChiÈ™inÄƒu.

I feel like any number of solutions to this problem exist, but because these people don't have a home country to exert pressure, nobody cares.

Excellent.  You know that I can't pass up a story like this...
