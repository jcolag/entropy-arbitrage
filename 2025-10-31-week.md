As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Early Week

I apologize that, again, I couldn't get my act together for Monday or Tuesday.  I got you half a week, though...

Wait, for Halloween, can I blame ghosts?  {% emoji ghost %}

### Also Somehow Late

Also, for some reason---maybe Ruby and/or my Mastodon server doesn't respect the same version of Daylight Saving that I need to---all the posts showed up an hour late, this week.  Go figure.

## 9:06 -- Wed 29 October 2025

 > Scientific evidence suggests, however, that sex is not always binary. In biology, sex refers to genes, reproductive organs, hormone systems and observable physical characteristics; different combinations of these lead to variations in sex. Far from straightforward, then, sex is complicated.

Hashtags:  #Gender #Censorship #LGBT

Early in the blog's life, I actually wrote a post going through the [complications of gender]({% post_url 2021-02-28-genders %}), starting from the genetic level of six common sex chromosome pairings in humans (more outside the species) and people who we identify as one gender despite their sex chromosomes but *not* transgender, intersex individuals, incorrect gender assignment, changing gender roles, and more, so I agree.

 > Reason teaches us not to waste time hoping for the promised prosperity that will never come and never materialize...Reason teaches us to be united in will, united in thought, and united in purpose and that we might have strength to combat the prevailing evil in our Nation.

 > Under the guise of technological inevitability, companies are using the AI boom to rewrite the social contract ‚Äî laying off employees, rehiring them at lower wages, intensifying workloads, and normalizing precarity.

Hashtags:  #AI #Economy #BigTech

In fact, you might recall that the Big Five companies started their mass layoffs *before* they had the convenient excuse.  They did this, fairly openly, to depress wages across the industry as their former employees flooded the job market at the same time.  The AI boom gives them that excuse, which I think explains a lot of why they keep pressuring us to care about a technology that doesn't do anything.

 > So would it be okay for the Mexican military to blow up a U.S. fishing boat because they believed it was smuggling deadly guns into Mexico, even if they offered no evidence? Would that be acceptable to this administration?

Hashtags:  #USPol

When friends brought this situation up, I made the point that we only have the word of a thirty-four-time convicted felon that these people have committed crimes, and the only two people who we could put on trial to *prove* it, we sent back home with no charges.  And that doesn't even get to our strong tradition of presuming innocence.

And like the piece says, if we accept these bombings as reasonable, then the administration *will* turn the same tactics to American cities, especially given that policing in this country has turned to [bombing residential neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_MOVE_bombing) only forty years ago.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > To confront this era of digitized captivity using the tools of abolitionist theories and praxis means recognizing that the surveillance industrial complex is no longer limited to overseeing physical walls, be they surrounding prisons or delineating borders. Today, our walls are fugitive; constantly shifting, slipping, and creeping through time and space.

My area has similarly flooded with surveillance cameras, and yet I haven't heard anybody mention using them to actually protect anybody...

 > However, the violations of these graves were easy enough. The cemetery was neither fenced nor formally tended. In the 1830s, medical schools began [robbing the burying ground](https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/) for cadavers. At the close of the Civil War, retreating Confederates [exploded the gunpowder magazine](https://www.tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/landslide2021/locations/shockoe.html), reportedly destroying a section of the cemetery.

Well, a country that can't convince itself that Black lives matter probably wouldn't care much about Black people in death, either, except for those who the media can sanitize and appropriate.
