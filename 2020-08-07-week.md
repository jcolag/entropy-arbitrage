As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The latest data, based on interviews with 292 people across 13 states, suggests that prolonged symptoms are not limited to severe cases.

This is definitely not the best sign.

 > ...elevated expression of genes such as TNF-α and IL-6, which are associated with inflammatory conditions such as infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and neurological disorders...

Beyond the obvious warning about sending kids back to play sports where this is a danger, it's worth noting that COVID-19 has a similar effect on the body.

Everybody in positions like that is sure that they can fight the influence of the people they work for, but their own research often proves them wrong, so this is a bigger deal than it might sound like.

The attacks on the Post Office are one of the bigger stories at a time when we're flooded with big stories.  The core concept of the Post Office is to allow a form of communication that doesn't discriminate.  They deliver to nearly every residence every day, and (when properly funded) move information across the country in a day.  At one point, they also provided banking services and should do so again.

Combine that with the need to vote by mail during an ongoing pandemic and as polling places close, and it's easy to see how important the institution is and how it can't be usefully replaced by private organizations.

 > In 1992, Barr said the FBI was shifting about 300 agents from monitoring spies from the recently collapsed Soviet Union to taking on gangs and violent crime in American cities.

There are also old interviews where Barr brags about how hard he worked to convince George H.W. Bush to send the military to Los Angeles in order to stifle the Rodney King uprising, wich much of the same rhetoric of gangs being set up to undermine the country.

 > Civilization is that mode of conduct which points out to man the path of duty. Performance of duty and observance of morality are convertible terms.

###### Mahatma Gandhi

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [For a happy life, don’t forget hedonism](https://www.futurity.org/hedonism-happiness-relaxation-2409402) from Futurity

 > It was always thought that hedonism, as opposed to self-control, was the easier option.  But really enjoying one’s hedonic choice isn't actually that simple for everybody because of those distracting thoughts.

Just a reminder that we do need to enjoy ourselves.
