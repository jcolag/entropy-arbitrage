This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Nevada**.

![Pink flowers](/blog/assets/5895557002_5a15b12c10_o.png "If this looks like a placeholder image...well, you've probably made worse assessments.")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Nevada**
 * Location:  <https://www.haveyoureadnevada.club/>, <https://transreads.org/nevada/>
 * Released:  2013
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Imogen Binnie
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately sixty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Coarse language, explicit sex including some "kink," illegal drug and alcohol use, stereotypes

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Nevada

I can't find any direct, Free-licensed information on this book but [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_%28Binnie_novel%29) describes it as follows.

 > **Nevada: A Novel** is the debut novel from author Imogen Binnie, released by Topside Press in 2013. Nevada follows the story of Maria Griffiths, a trans woman living in Brooklyn, who embarks on a road trip headed towards the West Coast. In the years following its release, it has been credited by literary critic Stephanie Burt as having starting a transgender literary movement and inspiring authors such as Torrey Peters and Casey Plett.

It goes on to point out that it sold around ten thousand copies before Topside went out of business, leading fans to take on distribution duties until other companies have picked it up more recently.

I should note that we may or may not have a film adaptation coming, though the director recently left the project.

## What Works Well?

It doesn't do so nearly frequently enough, but the book occasionally produces some interesting insight and/or useful idea.  Take probably the best of the section.

 > Eventually you can’t help but figure out that, while gender is a construct, so is a traffic light, and if you ignore either of them, you get hit by cars. Which, also, are constructs.

I usually put "social construct" in the context of language, money, countries, and so forth, but the traffic light analogy *does* work fairly well.

And...OK, look, I don't find myself enjoying the book, so far, but I do want to emphasize the book's *importance*.  As the Wikipedia article notes (and I quote above), this book *did* start a literary movement, and pushed other writers to write more successful books.  And we get to claim it as Free Culture.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Well...Oh, does the book want to take this criticism for me?

 > It’s an easy automatic go-to to characterize things as boring but it is boring to have the same exact things come up whenever anything comes up: poor me.

Yeah, I agree that the book shouldn't have started the book by doing that page after page.  It doesn't help when the protagonist *points it out* like that.  And it doesn't really matter how much cursing the characters do, or how much graphic---but somehow also extremely clinical---sex that they have, it doesn't make the book interesting unless we have a character to care about or writing to engage us.

Maybe related, for a book known for not explaining things, this feels like mostly dry exposition, including at least one full lecture about the nature of transgender existence.  But even ignoring that, it wants you to know *everything* that the protagonist sees and feels and thinks and senses and I **do not care**.  Sorry, let's let the book make this point for me.

 > Whatever yes sure fine yes whatever fine sure who cares.

I don't need directions on how to get around Brooklyn.  And the author seems to want this to make Maria seem so weird, for having an interest in some of the most mainstream "fringe" products of the 1990s.

## Opportunities

Other than buying the book where available, I don't see any means to contribute.

## What's Adaptable?

While it sounds like a euphemism more than a fictional place, we do apparently get Cow Town, Pennsylvania.  As much as the names similarly sound like dismissive terms, [BurritoVille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurritoVille) and Kellogg's Diner really do exist in the relevant locations.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll continue **Nevada**, with chapters 15 to 24.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
