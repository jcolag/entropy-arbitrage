As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Mass/Mainstream media also remains a key promoter of gender violence through perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, trivializing violence through watered down language, victim blaming narratives, and also platforming abusers.

Hashtags:  #Feminism #OnlineMisogyny

Whenever I see people ranting about how *this generation* of feminists has "gone too far"---unlike past cohorts who did their work before the speaker's political consciousness---I point to issues like this, as if Elizabeth Cady Stanton didn't care about victim-blaming, or that a law on the books that says "don't discriminate in these contexts" makes people completely equal.

 > In the case of Los Angeles, people seeking food stamps were granted more autonomy over the scheduling of their interview through access to a new caseworker hotline. As a result of this procedural intervention, applicants were more likely to enroll successfully in the SNAP program.

Heck of a coincidence, that, not throwing up obstacles to people feeding themselves improves the economy, almost like equality itself improves things...

 > Trump’s lawyers assert that children born in the United States of undocumented immigrants aren’t citizens because they aren’t subject to U.S. jurisdiction. That’s nonsense — jurisdiction has nothing to do with whether someone is legally in the United States.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Citizenship #Trump

Also, I would point out that, if undocumented immigrants "aren't subject to U.S. jurisdiction," then they have immunity from our laws, including immigration law, one imagines.  As a result, court case after court case has validated the idea that everything in the Constitution applies to everybody in American territory.  But this Supreme Court has tended to not care about little details like facts, law, precedent, and so forth.

 > The viral video that kicked it all off was a young Somali woman on TikTok claiming that Minnesota was promised to Somalis 3,000 years ago. Since then, Somalis have been joking that they want a two-state solution, that Americans have 49 other states they could choose from, so why not give them one?

I love this, both because I find it funny, and as evidence that the Trump administration no longer commands fear in the way that it thinks it does.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > By the mid-1930s, a handful of vertically integrated studios dominated Hollywood – MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, RKO and 20th Century Fox – functioning like a state-sanctioned oligopoly. They controlled who worked, what films were made and what made it into the theaters they owned. And though the studios’ holdings came and went, the rules of the industry remained stable until after World War II.

Either way, this would make an excellent time to start re-evaluating your streaming subscriptions and putting some saved money towards independent media.
