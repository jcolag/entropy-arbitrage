As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Good for them, and I hope their momentum continues.

 > Women were central to Cold War-era international debates about the two competing political and economic systems. On both sides of the Iron Curtain, governments used references to women‚Äôs happiness as proof their respective models provided good lives for their population, even though reality was often different.

Hashtags:  #ColdWar #DomesticWork #Gender

Yes, exactly.  As much as certain people always want to insist that gender roles arise from some natural dimorphism, the fact that roles change from culture to culture and across decades always exposes that as a blatant lie.

The results have their uneven aspects, but on the whole, people who can work generally keep working, and the money goes to investing in a better future, such as paying off debt.

And, I feel like I need to say, that they absolutely intended for this to happen.  The fear does the work of making the laws stricter without their needing to expose themselves to voters as this desperate to control women.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/published_by_the_author_self_publication_in_nineteenth_century_african_american_literature_1050x700.jpg|A book cover with a title Published by the Author|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Self-Publishing and the Black American Narrative](https://daily.jstor.org/self-publishing-black-american-narrative/) from JSTOR Daily

 > Aside from condemning racism and injustice, self-published authors celebrated personal achievements in the hope of securing social status. As Reverend Robert Anderson said of his 1845 self-published autobiography, Life: The Young Men‚Äôs Guide, ‚ÄúMy book, in fact, has made me happy, because I feel that if the white people will read it they will discover that a colored man can write a book, too, just as well as anybody else.‚Äù

While self-publishing definitely attracts a lot of cranks and people who otherwise shouldn't get a platform anywhere else, definitely also serves as a refuge from an industry that has extremely specific ideas of how it wants books---and authors---to look.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A Democratic media strategy to save journalism and the nation](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/12/the-view-from-somewhere/#abolish-rogan) from Pluralistic

 > What if Dems funded free newsgathering and publication in news deserts that told the truth? What if these news outlets, by dint of being an explicitly partisan, party-subsidized project, refused to adopt all the anti-reader practices of other websites, like disgusting surveillance, intrusive advertising, AI slop, email-soliciting pop-ups, and all the other crap that makes the news worse and worse every day?

It does frustrate me that we don't see this, given how it takes a bunch of problems and really mostly has them "solve each other," by supplying some money to get things started.  We have unemployed journalists, news deserts, and an ignorant population.  Not only that, but we already know this model works globally, because Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty exist on exactly that basis, with the United States---rather than a political party---directly employing journalists to report the news to show that a free press strengthens a country rather than harming it.

 > ...screenshots soon surfaced allegedly showing Joshua Gillespie, one half of the husband and wife duo who ran the account, apologizing to a woman named Megan, a fellow Muppets fan who runs the account [@malonespops](https://www.instagram.com/malonespops/), for sexually inappropriate comments.

The mind truly boggles, here, doesn't it...?
