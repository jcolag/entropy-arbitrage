* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![A painting with eleven inset scenes, the corners and central seven depicting the gods that give their names to the days of the week](/blog/assets/Elihu-Vedder-Abundance-Days-Week-1926.png "Impressive to synchronize fouling up the pull-the-tablecloth trick with four Cupids...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

> In 2026, over 1,000 people remain imprisoned in Louisiana after being convicted by non-unanimous juries [a Jim Crow–era policy].

Hashtags:  #Racism #Louisiana #Courts

Notice how this further gets around the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of slavery.  That already carves out an exception as punishment for a crime, and this makes it easier to get a conviction.

> Optics is an example of the different ways a human is able to see things in the world. The same goes for the color of a person's skin and even though optics present that there are differences in color, these do not state that they should necessarily be treated as different.

You might think that the headline exaggerates DHS's position, but it turns out that they said almost exactly that they didn't record any footage, it had no relevance to the case, and that plaintiffs should stop asking for such things.

Normally, I roll my eyes when pundits talk about how, legally speaking, the people who consistently break the law can't cross this line.  But it hadn't occurred to me that doing so much have some indirect value.

> Land monopoly—in the hands of individuals, corporations or syndicates—is at bottom the prime cause of the inequalities which obtain; which desolate fertile acres turned over to vast ranches and into bonanza farms of a thousand acres, where not one family finds a habitation, where muscle and brain are supplanted by machinery, and the small farmer is swallowed up and turned into a tenant or slave.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A Birthday Cake Song for 25 Years of Wikipedia!](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2026/01/26/a-birthday-cake-song-for-25-years-of-wikipedia/) from Diff

> Seeing the scenes from the singers’ kitchens was fun, and the excitement grew with the addition of Ferfive’s lovely soprano voice, recorded in a Wikimedia apron and hat, Lukas’ playful clarinet, and Johnny’s percussion. Finally, Ferfive and Misosoof’s virtuoso ‘rap’ delivery left us speechless, bringing the fun-filled music to a close. After the party ended, we were delighted to see the usernames of all 15 members who performed recognized on the screen.

It has no relationship with it, but it reminds me a lot of when the Free Music Archive protested one of the copyright infringement wins by Warner Music protecting *Happy Birthday to You*[^voYz-5] by [soliciting Free Culture alternatives](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Happy_Birthday_Song_Contest/The_New_Birthday_Song_Contest) in hopes of seeding the ground to eventually overshadow the more famous song.

[^voYz-5]:  In a later case, the defendant found an early version of the song definitively in the public domain, finally invalidating the copyright.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Freedom of all kinds is worth fighting for](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-100/) from Molly White

> Many of these executives have long made it clear that authoritarianism isn’t just collateral damage in their pursuit of business-boosting deregulation, but a desirable outcome. Marc Andreessen, an outspoken Trump supporter, adviser, and recruiter, published a 2023 [manifesto on “techno-optimism”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto) that explicitly cited as one of its “patron saints” [Filippo Tommaso Marinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti) — co-author of the [Fascist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Manifesto) that formed the platform for Mussolini. Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz alum Balaji Srinivasan has promulgated the idea of the “network state”, an autocratic proposal to create tech-governed city-states free from democratic oversight. Current Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Andreessen, and the Winklevoss twins have all expressed support for the concept. And the Winklevosses have even funded a proposed network state called [Praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(proposed_city)), whose CEO rather overtly embraces fascism.

As I keep saying, when people in power use words, we need to take care not to assume that they mean the same things that we do by those same words.  When they talk about "freedom," they mean *their* freedom to discriminate, defraud, and extract.  "Fraud," to them, means that they don't like that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.  And so on.
