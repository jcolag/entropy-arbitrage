This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes (for now?) reading **Trans Girl Project**, including the remainder of *The Tea* and (all of) *The Sport Bra*.

![The comic's cover, featuring a scantily clad, female-presenting person sitting with knees up to block most of the body](/blog/assets/000-trans-girl-project-cover-by-legendarya-da8funa.png "Nothing about this worries me half as much as the science fiction-y title font mixed with the word Project...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Trans Girl Project**
 * Location:  <https://www.deviantart.com/legendarya>
 * Released:  2016 -- 2023 (possibly the present)
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  [Aryadna Dreams](https://www.deviantart.com/legendarya/about)
 * Medium:  Web comic
 * Length:  Approximately forty-nine pages (or possibly hundreds)
 * Content Advisories:  Brief nudity

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Trans Girl Project

The comic bills itself as follows.

 > A feminist porn comic about the fantasies of an asexual trans girl.

Early pages list two translations.

 > [Spanish:](https://legendarya.deviantart.com/art/Trans-Girl-Project-ESP-Portada-607127108)[legendarya.deviantart.com/art/…](https://legendarya.deviantart.com/art/TGP-ESP-Patreon-Page-607127927)
 >
 > Japanese: [nugalis.com/comics/trans-girl-…](http://nugalis.com/comics/trans-girl-project)

I don't know how literally or seriously the author meant that description, nor do I know how many pages *actually* belong in the comic, or much of anything else, so we'll stick to the three stories in their own section with clear identification and work from there.  This might---I don't know, as I write this---mean skipping a bunch of story, but we can all always read more at another time.

To the extent that the description of the comic as pornography holds true, I'll reiterate what I said when talking about [Eroticature]({% post_url 2021-07-31-eroticature %}):  Erotica doesn't generally titillate me, because it represents somebody else's fantasy.  That creates an immediate problem in discussions like this, because generally, the story exists in service to the "sexy bits," so if what turns you on doesn't turn me on, then the story unfairly falls flat, possibly regardless of its quality.

## What Works Well?

Even granting the acknowledgement---see the page comments---that Arya's problems derive from the author's experiences, the minor and awkward nature of them still feels surprisingly real in a comic of computer-generated people.  Tastes will vary, but I suspect that most people will find the couple of sequences charming or relatable.

We also get some real insight into Arya's character, this time through, as the date conversation turns to how her relationships generally work, nicely I think, treading the fine line between giving her more depth and teaching us---using Xana as a proxy---how she views her asexuality.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

A bit of confusion in the presentation, I guess, it looks like *The Sport Bra* actually comes **before** *The Tea*, leading to all sorts of confusion about why they introduce themselves after a long conversation.  This makes Xana seem even pushier, though, bursting in on Arya to help her with her bra before they met.  If you want to read this in more depth than to follow these posts, I'd recommend skipping the contained stories and reading page-by-page from the beginning, instead.  I'll probably do that, myself, when I have the time.

## Opportunities

The first non-cover page of the comic has a fairly robust description on helping out.

 > Before starting with the comic, I want to tell you that I have created an account for this project: [www.patreon.com/aryafae](https://www.patreon.com/aryafae)
 >
 > If I were able to make money with this, I will allocate it to:
 >
 > - The Expenses of my own transition
 > - Graphic card & 3D models for the comic
 > - My project of e-learning Japanese
 >
 > For patrons, there will be more risqué fan-service (bonus content). My character in the comic is my self-conscious or repressed side. It's a different kind of porn, but in the fan-service there will be more freedom.
 >
 > You can also ask me personal questions and give me your own suggestions for fan-service. You can even ask to see photos of my transition. However, I might not agree to every request.
 >
 > I do not have high hopes of making money on this project, but know that it will continue even if there are no contributions. If I can get other people excited about my work to the point that they are willing to pay for it, I will feel very proud.

They also list (big corporate) social media links, if you'd rather take that approach.

## What's Adaptable?

We learn in this section that Arya works at a company called Nugalis---previously the domain where the creator posted comics and other projects---that makes **Japanese Learn Phrasebook** (sic), a language-training app.  Checking the business signs, our duo meet in Ashley Boutique ("exceptional clothing") across the street from the extraordinarily generic City Bank and a few other shops that I don't really have the patience to "zoom and enhance" to work out...

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll start reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**.  As a novella, I suppose, we'll split the book into three parts, from *Acclaim The Sun* to *Inquiring For Support*.  If you reach *The Moon Strikes Once More*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
