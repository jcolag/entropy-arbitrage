## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Violations

You'll want to consider a content advisory for this episode, for metaphorical sexual assault that includes one literal sexual assault.  You probably don't need a content advisory for the ham-fisted script that doesn't seem to know what it actually wants to say about its central topic, though...

 > **KEIKO**: It's Obaachan! My grandmother. She's doing ink brush writing. I can remember it now. She used that cup for cleaning the brushes, and it was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table. I would sit beside her and watch the most beautiful characters come from that brush. And the whole time, she'd be humming to herself. I remember it like it was yesterday.

If you (somehow) didn't remember, Keiko reminds us that she grew up surrounded by Japanese culture...

Also, by the way, I believe that this will make the only episode where Keiko appears without Miles looming over her...

 > **TARMIN**: You are right, but sometimes with a beautiful woman, I can not help myself.

See, in *my* world, this statement provides more than sufficient reason to work with another contractor...

 > **RIKER**: None that I'd care to share with an audience.

Oh, please.  Does his audience not include enough underage colleagues for his boring sex stories?  Or does he only air that dirty laundry on duty?

 > **DATA**: My understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is the same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. If you want to retrieve it, you simply access the proper RNA sequence.

We have never really understood how [human memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory) works on a mechanical level, and most theories haven't lasted long or had much empirical backing, but Data at least presents one major then-current theory.  Modern theories tend to lean on a variety of interacting mechanisms, and you can still find articles published regularly insisting that this team or that team has discovered the "real" method, sometimes re-proposing variations on RNA-based storage[^1].

[^1]:  I should probably note, especially since Data speaks the line in question, that artificial intelligence research plays a big role in why everybody wants to find the specific mechanisms involved in human memory, beyond helping people with memory disorders.  Neural networks---the current industry darling that shoves large language models down your throat at every opportunity---operate on the classical assumption that we store memories as networks of synapses, the connections between our neurons.  If it turns out that we actually store memories as RNA stashed in cells, to pick one possible example, then the artificial neural networks *definitely* don't have the theoretical backing that its proponents believe that they have.

 > **LAFORGE**: Sometimes there are memories we just can't access at the spur of the moment. For instance, I have no recollection of how I spent my last birthday. Birthdays are important occasions, and you would think that I'd remember how I spent the day, but right now I can't even remember where I was. Deck two. On the other hand, I remember everything about the time I got my first pet. A Circassian cat. I was eight. I remember how funny-looking he was. I remember how excited I was. It's as if it happened yesterday.

Though we've never seen a celebration that actually fits the alleged excitement, [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %}) and [*Future Imperfect*]({% post_url 2023-12-28-future-imperfect %}) suggest that people get more excited about birthdays than I've seen among adults during my life, and this suggests that everyone should consider each birthday memorable.

No shame if you make a big deal about your birthday.  I only find it improbable, given its rarity in our world, that many people in a future where "years" don't exist as a universal concept would pay close attention to adult birthdays, except as a tool of cultural dominion.  To pick a quick "local" example of what I mean, consider somebody born in a hypothetical colony on (or in the atmosphere of) Neptune.  Their year would occur every hundred-sixty (or so) of ours, and so almost nobody would reach one year of age, *unless* they used units of time from Earth, even though they have no intrinsic meaning once you leave Earth.

 > **PICARD**: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularly good subject.

I need to point out that the two highest-ranking officers on the ship have both brushed this off as amusing for *other* people, but not for them.  In Picard's case, especially, I wonder how this relates to the various incidents that we've had since [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}), where it seemed like he might have a decided preference for popular lies over difficult truths.  It especially seems like a possibility, given how much Crusher needles him about it.

Worf will also angrily decline, but that fits the character better than feigning excitement while other people undergo scans and then sputtering when offered the same.  Likewise, La Forge apparently had a traumatic childhood, as we learned in [*Hero Worship*]({% post_url 2024-07-25-hero-worship %}), so it makes sense that he wouldn't want people rooting around in there.

 > **TROI**: Oh, I can't read Ullians, but I do know a certain Betazoid mother who is a great deal like your father.

For the record, Tarmin talked about Jev's poor abilities to a group of strangers.  As far as we've seen, Lwaxana hasn't done worse to Troi than as if she feels OK and why she has abandoned her culture.  Troi sees those as equivalent, though.

 > **JEV**: Imzadi. Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that.

If you didn't understand the episode's central metaphor and title, have no fear, Troi's exposure to the plot will also include a literal (psychic) sexual assault so that you have time to catch up and trivialize whatever they have to say about the issue...

 > **TROI**: No! No! No! Don't!

Also, wait a minute.  Does this represent an actual *memory* that Troi has?  We've known since almost the beginning that Riker wants people to see him as sexually active despite running away, and he does seem to enjoy showing certain colleagues what kind of power he has, so it doesn't seem entirely out of the question.  And it paints [*A Matter of Perspective*]({% post_url 2023-08-03-matter-perspective %}) in a far creepier light, especially Troi's "he never attacked *me*, therefore he never attacked anybody" defense of him.

 > **MARTIN**: No. I'm still getting unusual neurotransmitter readings in the diencephalon, but they might be a result of the coma.

The [diencephalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diencephalon) does actually exist in the brain, which you may also know as the tweenbrain or interbrain, depending on how long you've held on your neuroscience books.

 > **CRUSHER**: I'll check the biofilter readings from the Ullian transporter log. It's possible they could still be carrying a harmful organism.

Good to see that they learned exactly nothing from [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}).

Thank goodness that we live in more enlightened times, when people take the experience of a devastating infection quickly spreading through the population and...wait, we do *what* while COVID-19 still kills hundreds of people every day?

 > **RIKER**: Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me. I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate the brain, speed the healing. In fact, I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear a friendly voice, even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've been busy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusual thing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else? I finished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check it out when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long.

If you thought---or hoped---that you hallucinated [*Shades of Gray*]({% post_url 2023-04-20-shades-gray %}), no, they really did run a clip show, and decided to reference the frame sequence in the script, here.

 > **RIKER**: Let's move it! Out, out, out! Let's go! Everybody move! Everybody move! Out! Out! Come on, keep moving!

This has nothing to do with our project, really, but does Jev have anything like an agenda, here?  The scene wouldn't hold much interest for us in an episode where it pertained to the plot, and Riker has always seemed the most cold-blooded of the main cast when it comes to dealing with deaths of colleagues, so this incident probably doesn't haunt him, even though the memory seems to *want* him to feel bad about it.

 > **CRUSHER**: I found the same pattern. If I didn't know better, I'd say they both had Iresine syndrome. That's the only medical condition that would produce that pattern.

Far from pertaining to neurology, [iresine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iresine) comes from the amaranth family, more on the ornamental side, as opposed to the clades that give us spinach, beets, quinoa, and so forth.

 > **PICARD**: What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? I don't see that those would be any more effective.

Note that he doesn't think that confining them will help, but feels like doing it anyway, I guess because he hasn't had the opportunity to assert his power over aliens in a while.  I mean, if he wanted to deprive them of access to the crew, he could toss them off the ship.  If he didn't think that they had any concerns, he could let them wander free.  But instead, he takes the route of the moral panic, opting to punish people with no intent of solving the actual problem.

 > **PICARD**: You were the first. The next day Commander Riker fell into a similar coma. Last night, Doctor Crusher.

Wait, one person dropped each night, and they waited all this time to seriously consider the possibility that somebody did this intentionally?  What, did they think that the shopping list of chemicals that they had La Forge review might need to wait until bedtime to become potent?

 > **PICARD**: No, please don't look on it like that. We have done everything we can to explain these comas. We have performed physical examinations, and neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic, looking for viruses, parasites, infestations. We have investigated every possible cause we can imagine. We have found nothing. Nothing to explain these comas. The only variable that we have not been able to eliminate is your presence here on this ship. Now, in the light of our actions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it.

I have to laugh at how quickly he tried to back off from his confinement approach.

 > **INAD**: Jev is making a reasonable request, Captain. If we're to be accused, surely we're entitled to a defense? Tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew. Has she suffered any ill effects?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: I will discuss the matter with Counselor Troi.

I feel the need to point out that this looks a lot like letting a potential serial killer conduct the forensic investigation, because the suspect claims that they need a stronger defense.  And it goes about as you'd expect it to.

 > **LAFORGE**: Maybe not every medical facility is as careful as Doctor Crusher. Maybe it's easier to just make a quick diagnosis rather than to keep hunting for the real cause.

Wow, could you even imagine living in a world where some doctors don't care about their patients, and so jump to the first conclusion that might fit, so that they can get on with their days and maximize throughput?  Oh, right.  Sorry, I get forgetful, sometimes...

I do wonder, though, if this hints at the Federation having a for-profit health care system, since it doesn't seem likely that you'd see this kind of behavior without a profit motive.  Note that they take pains to contrast the situation on these worlds with the care that they receive from Crusher's team, paid a salary---or whatever they do---by a military-like group to care for the thousand-or-so people on the *Enterprise* and nothing else.

 > **TROI**: I'm alone in my quarters. I'm remembering something from a few years ago.

Yeah, apparently that event actually happened.

 > **PICARD**: I'm not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution. Memory invasion is simply not a crime we've ever had to contend with.

...Wait, *what*?

He has had colleagues suffer violations which the attacker's home planet has outlawed.  Does he refuse to recognize their legal system or does he not care about the crime?

Oh, right.  With Picard, you probably get a little of column A and a little from column B...

 > **PICARD**: Earth was once a violent planet, too. At times, the chaos threatened the very fabric of life, but, like you, we evolved. We found to find better ways to handle our conflicts. But I think no one can deny that the seed of violence remains within each of us. We must recognize that, because that violence is capable of consuming each of us. As it consumed your son.

I mean...Troi's memory of Riker forcing himself on her kind of implies that evolution hasn't gone so well, but keep patting yourself on the back, I guess, Picard.

## Conclusions

This episode gets *dark*, if you read between the lines.

### The Bad

We get a reminder that at least some humans live in strictly ethnic enclaves.

They appear to find it charming to see the overt sexism of pressuring a woman to open up her life because the person finds her attractive.  Such comments provoke amused smiles, rather than reprimands or disgust.  By contrast, people with institutional power seem almost panicked by the idea of somebody overhearing them recount their memories.

Apparently, Riker once assaulted Troi over her protestations, and the two opted to cover up the incident.

The crew continues to not care about safety protocols, until a crisis causes them to have the computer review the data for possible causes.  They similarly refuse to see an intelligent cause to problems that appear to occur at regular intervals.

Picard once again shows his fear of aliens with power and his love of control over them, by insisting on confining them, but refusing to confront them in any meaningful way.  He even allows them to run the criminal investigation and an examination of a victim.  We also see the disregard of sovereign governments and their laws alongside a disregard for the safety of the crew, as Picard refuses to prosecute somebody who deliberately put his colleagues into comas after violating them.  Yet he continues to believe that humans have completely evolved, with only minor exceptions.

The Federation may---we don't get enough information on the locations---have a for-profit healthcare system that leads to doctors jumping to quick diagnoses over deeper investigations.

### The Weird

We hear again that people make a big deal about birthdays.

## Next

In seven days, Picard tries to justify leaving people to a terrible life, again, in *The Masterpiece Society*.
