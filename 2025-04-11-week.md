As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Measles can cause acute brain damage in two different ways: a direct infection of the brain that occurs in roughly 1 in 1,000 people, or inflammation of the brain two to 30 days after infection that occurs with the same frequency.

During my first year at college, I needed to sit out classes for a couple of weeks to get re-vaccinated, because my medical records didn't supply enough clarity after years of not having a regular family physician.  At the time, it irritated me, because I absolutely got the same MMR vaccine as everybody else.  In retrospect, though, learning that my cohort might not have received boosters because we considered single shots good enough, that incident has finally pleased me.

If you don't definitively know your situation, go get vaccinated.  Measles doesn't joke around, and we only consider it a joke because vaccinations all but eradicated it in affluent areas almost overnight.

Ironically, Trump probably *does* mean to use them for as sanctions against behavior that he doesn't like, but he wants to force loyalty to his personal causes, rather than to improve anybody else's life.

We usually frame these conversations, we this article does, with defeating authoritarians.  However, we really should start making the point that no political movement ever reaches its "end of history."  Democracy fails when we assume that nothing can stop it, much like it only takes some resistance to drive authoritarians out.

In fact, the exact reasons that administrations like Trumps would want a unified view of all data about citizens and residents map directly to the reasons that we built the system to separate that information.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How Investigative Journalists Actually Find Fraud, Waste and Abuse ](https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-government-waste-fraud-approach) from ProPublica

 > Because perfectly placed acquaintances and random invites to classified Signal chats are rare in real life, ProPublica relies on a more straightforward playbook for finding WFA (waste, fraud and abuse). It bears little resemblance to the approach deployed by Team DOGE against agencies like the [Social Security Administration](https://www.propublica.org/article/recording-reveals-leland-dudek-thoughts-trump-doge-social-security) or [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.propublica.org/topics/usaid). Pro tip for chainsaw-wielders: You can almost never understand what‚Äôs happening inside a complex organization from your initial pass through records and documents.

When I taught algorithms classes---and I should probably expand this to a post, someday---I used to make the point that "efficiency" doesn't actually exist without a context, on top of the other problems.  Exactly like meritocracy has no meaning because anything from good grades on standardized tests to gender and ethnicity can work as a "merit," efficiency depends on what you want to optimize for.
