As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The federal holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation, signed earlier by President Abraham Lincoln, which freed enslaved people. (After the U.S. Civil War ended, Texas was the last former Confederate state to recognize emancipation.)

The same, naturally, goes for victims of abuse, and many other people in danger.  Remember this, whenever someone says, "if you haven't done anything wrong, then you have nothing to hide."  You and I may not have anything to hide, but someone out there *absolutely* does.

 > ...the tasks employees perform are often not what leads to their mental health degradation. Instead, an employer‚Äôs culture and the way its jobs are designed play big roles.

Hashtags:  #MentalHealth #Work

While I make a point of not giving particulars about any specific job that I may have worked on, I don't think that it would violate that principle too much---without stating where or when---that I have experienced fairly extreme burnout in my career, and can definitely confirm that the work load and stress had almost nothing to do with how that shook out.  It all rested on how the corporate culture treated issues that I and others raised.

I hope that this goes so well that conservatives can't make a case that it "costs too much."

I love that, whenever we investigate the people behind these offensive names, we invariably find out that the people behind them had almost nothing to recommend them, other than standing on the wrong side of history at a time when the people in power sympathized.  And yet, we still have people who find that more than sufficient to defend the names.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Ashley%27s_Sack_%28Slave_Sack_c._mid-19th_century%29.jpg|A sack embroidered by Ruth Middleton with the story of how the sack was a gift from an enslaved mother, Rose, to her daughter, Ashley, when the nine-year old was sold|false|by Shameran81, made available under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 International license %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Judges still cite cases in which enslaved people are property](https://www.futurity.org/slavery-citations-laws-2933722-2/) from Futurity

 > For example, a citation about damage to a car or damage to a dump truck that uses precedent about damage to an enslaved person dehumanizes the enslaved person‚Äîthey‚Äôre all basically treated the same.

I understand the necessity of this---the unfairness of the surrounding regime doesn't invalidate the relevance of a particular interpretation of law---but it does mean that we subject a lot of people in courtrooms to a pretty terrible version of the world.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [American Indians forced to attend boarding schools as children are more likely to be in poor health as adults](https://theconversation.com/american-indians-forced-to-attend-boarding-schools-as-children-are-more-likely-to-be-in-poor-health-as-adults-194691) from The Conversation

 > Although those practices are well documented, quantitative research into whether they had an effect on the long-term physical health of American Indian people who were subjected to them was hard to come by.

This qualifies as another situation where I can't imagine that any serious people doubted this result, but feel grateful that we now have the numbers to point at when non-serious people say predictably bad things.

 > As anti-Black racism continues to plague America today, from police brutality to the arrests of Black voters, Rosewood‚Äôs descendants and researchers believe Floridians should learn about the event in order to better understand persistent racial disparities.

You can presumably see why people like DeSantis don't want this sort of history taught:  It makes it easier to draw a line from slavery and colonization to these sorts of events to policies like his.
