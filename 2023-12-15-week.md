As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I feel disappointed that the study doesn't really get into the flip-side of the issue.  Specifically, we often spread the advice to avoid "feeding the trolls," as if we can only reply to someone with the intent of engaging in a conversation.  But in many cases, you can find more value in using the troll's platform to nudge their *audience*.  When I still [posted to Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}), I used to call that "playing to the cheap seats," making sure that a hypothetical young person stumbling into someone's hateful post would see another perspective that not only feels less slimy or destructive, but also commands at least as much respect from others.

I rarely make a big deal about famous people.  I find it crass to suggest that a celebrity's death means more than some person from your town who neither of us have ever met.  However, Lear had a *massive* impact on the culture---for the better, both in entertainment and politics---for decades.  He had some clear flaws, like talking excitedly about how conservatives would write him saying that Archie Bunker made them "feel seen," without capitalizing on that to change their minds on issues, but I suspect that we'd live in a darker world without his shows expanding what we would accept as American life or his work to oppose right-wing political messaging before anybody else had the sense to talk about it.

Not as often as I like, but I enjoy spending time applying classical "domestic skills" to make things, whether that results in dinner on the table every night, an undershirt, or inconsequential piece of furniture.  Apart from the warm feeling of having accomplished something for myself, it quickly illustrates the absurd prices that we pay for almost anything.  For example, if I made myself a pair of [wrap pants](https://freesewing.org/docs/designs/waralee) for the summer---something that I keep intending to do, because they look comfortable *and* not beyond my ability to make---two-and-a-half yards of decent linen would cost me nearly thirty dollars if I can't find a sale, and it would probably take me somewhere around four to eight hours to cut and sew it.  If we set the price of my labor at anything approaching reasonable, like fifteen bucks per hour, then, these pants would cost around a hundred fifty dollars to make.

By contrast, if we go for a [sport coat](https://freesewing.org/docs/designs/jaeger), instead, then we want about three yards of a heavy fabric like wool and a similar amount of lining (sixty to seventy dollars), and enough labor that I'd have a hard time estimating it accurately.  Forty hours, maybe?  In other words, that sport coat would cost well over five hundred dollars.

Even granting that we don't have an apples-to-apples comparison, here, between mass production and custom clothing, you can still see the deep difference in price against cost.  Most of our clothes probably cost less than the *material* would cost us on the retail market, never mind figuring in the labor and worker welfare that we would want.  And the same goes for almost every class of product.

I don't actually find this an unlikely target at all.  Many conservatives---and not always the extremists---have *always* hated the idea of a woman filing for divorce without a court forcing her to prove that she has no other recourse.  They see it---as several have told me over many years---as a woman's duty to keep their family together no matter what the situation...and that they believe that all family property inherently belongs to the husband, and so they imagine alimony or even child support as "theft," rather than a domestic partner's share of the property based on the extensive labor provided around the house.

As such, they have always had plans like this in mind.  The situation has changed, though, in that they have become delusional enough to think that they can make it happen and survive politically.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

Given my age, I certainly know some of this art and some context behind it, but even decades later, it impresses me.

 > When scientists draw on individualist arguments to explain gender inequality‚Äîthus ignoring these gendered processes‚Äîthey may blunt initiatives that can promote women‚Äôs equity in STEM.

This disconnect makes some sense, unfortunately.  While wrong, nobody wants to feel like they got their position unfairly.  Therefore, the "facts" need to fit the conclusion of fairness, rather than finding a conclusion that fits the available facts.

In modern politics, this converges on the idea of "wokeness," where we have a significant minority of people who find it highly offensive for someone to remind them of any unfairness in the world, especially unfairness that they may have contributed to.
