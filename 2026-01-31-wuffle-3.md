This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading **Wuffle**.

![Wuffle carving a hedgehog-shaped mold to restore his friend](/blog/assets/wuffle-mold.png "I know, thematically I should've gone with something chicken-related...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Wuffle**

 * Released:  2012 -- 2015 (or maybe 2021)
 * License:  CC0

 * Medium:  Web comic
 * Length:  Approximately 195 pages
 * Content Advisories:  Gambling, family issues

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Wuffle

The creator of the comic describes it as follows.

> **Wuffle** is different from other wolves. While most wolves are sneaky and tricky, Wuffle is innocent, naive, and kind-hearted, always willing to help people without expecting anything in return.
>
> **Wuffle** was actually one of the projects that started back in the year 2008. At that time, he was designed to be the main character of the game with the same name.
>
> The game is a parody of many famous fairy tales with a wolf in the story, such as the Three Little Pigs, and the Little Red Riding Hood.
>
> It was supposed to be a platformer game about Wuffle fighting the three evil pigs, stopping them from destroying his land and turn the land into big factories.
>
> Unfortunately, we never actually had time to work on the project, and it eventually got cancelled.
>
> However, I was really in love with Wuffle’s design. I want to see him comes to life in some form. If he can’t be in a game, then he can be in something else. And that’s when I started working on the Wuffle comics project.
>
> Finally, after 4 years, I think I have found the perfect story for him. I just want to see him comes to life, see him living his little adventure with his friends. And here it is, in your hand, the comic as you can see today.
>
> I want Wuffle to be a comic for everyone. I want to bring back the old charms of the good old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young.
>
> I hope you enjoy the comic, and will come to love Wuffle the same way that I have.  
>
> Welcome to the world of Wuffle, the big heart wolf!

I have actually had this on my radar for a while, but somehow kept forgetting about it for some reason.

Oh, I should probably mention that, if you didn't notice it in reading the comics, the "2015" comics for this batch stretched through 2017.

## What Works Well?

In the [first post about the comic]({% post_url 2026-01-17-wuffle-1 %}), I noted that, right out of the gate, this all felt *competent*.  In that, I meant that it launched with a firm understanding of its craft.  Now, not only do I see no problem with creating projects as a learning experience, in most cases, you probably should *not* launch a project if you won't learn anything, so I appreciate that aspects such as pacing have tightened up on the longer stories.  I still have some mild criticisms that I'll get to later, but the ten-plus page stories feel more satisfying at the end than they did in the first batch.

I also appreciate (and enjoyed) that the comics have gotten bolder.  If you had told me, two weeks ago, that this "funny animal" comic spending a surprising amount of time on amorous hens and frying eggs would engage with parental abandonment issues and gender dysphoria, let alone do so in a compelling and sensitive way, I don't think that I would've believed you.  And yet...

Oh, and maybe related to that boldness *and* the improvements to craft, many side-characters found some depth.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

As I mentioned above, the long-term pacing improved dramatically, with the multipage stories feeling like they have a much stronger arc to them.  However, this seems to have come at the expense of in-page pacing, where a specific installment of the comic---and remember that, when new, most of these pages would've shown up days apart, if not a full week---might not work out of context or even have any story to it.

Take, for example, the [end of the play](https://wufflecomics.tumblr.com/image/152447362231).  Cheering.  More cheering.  Even more cheering.  As the final scene of a fifteen-page comic, it uses seven percent of the time to wind down the overall story.  But as a periodic installment of a comic?  It doesn't really have anything to say, other than reminding us that the play ended.  You'll find a few pages like this, where the comic seems to forget that new readers could show up at any time, so every entry-point should have something engaging happening[^1XcasF].

[^1XcasF]:  Granted, the comic stands in fairly good company.  Think about how many serialized television shows spend the first three episodes tediously setting up the story, not considering that not everybody has three hours to burn on the chance that something might eventually happen.  Or think about earlier attempts at serialized television, where the middle of every season flounders, because they set up the problem, but can't resolve it for another dozen episodes...

## Opportunities

The author appears go have moved on from the comic, but does have an active [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/pitiyindee) working on a traditional hand-animated cartoon for a different wolf character.

## What's Adaptable?

We get the books **Just for Pun!!** and Shellock House's **A Study in Spade**, Café Vanon, the Fintendo game console---though the similarity to a real-world console might make it tougher to justify---the impressive rewrite of *Little Red Riding Hood*, and the Yindee & Kirke City Food Pantry.

The last, if you hadn't caught on, takes its name from the strip's creator and Leo Kirke, who did some writing and proofreading for the comic.  I often dislike moves like this in mainstream comics, but as a victory lap for the comic, it makes a bit of sense.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll play **Vampire Corpse Feast**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
