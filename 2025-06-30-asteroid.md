Today marks [International Asteroid Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Day), commemorating the anniversary of the [Tunguska event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event) that has driven [so much science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event_in_fiction) over the last century or so.  In practice, it serves more as an excuse to talk about [impact avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact_avoidance).

And with that, on we go to the projects.

## Argh, Part 2

Following up on [last week's developer diary post]({% post_url 2025-06-23-midsummer %}), resetting the [BIOS memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvolatile_BIOS_memory) got the newer laptop past the first hurdle of at least doing *something* on boot, it doesn't seem to get past turning on the Caps Lock light, and then stalls.  No fan, no screen backlight, nothing.

I may try to do some more thorough investigation, but at this point, the machine does look dead.

Reluctant as I feel to ship the thing off for servicing---both given how little I trust them at this point, not to mention how many things that they might find wrong, causing me to suspect that "repair" will look a lot like buying a new laptop but with two-year-old materials---I may do some more detailed investigation when I have the time.

Meanwhile, I have secured access to one of the briefly available Framework laptop that only shipped with the chassis and motherboard.  With some scavenged parts and some shady-looking memory (available cheap enough that I won't mind if it doesn't work), plus a USB adapter for the hard drives, and I *could* have something reasonable running during the week, maybe with an old Raspberry Pi[^1] somewhere in the mix to supplement things.

[^1]:  Yes, I have the same feelings about the company cozying up with police.  I wouldn't buy one *today*, but they already had my money long before that issue arose, and it makes a lot of sense to use them---two, I believe that I have---to maybe handle the media server in general, store podcasts, and maybe even run other servers in-house.

I wouldn't call it an ideal situation, but it might suffice until I can get everything normally running again.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the fifth.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the eighth of July.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  Honestly, I can't make any promises for reasons described above, but I promise that you'll get *something*.  In theory, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic, but I don't have access to some of that or my media consumption list, unfortunate since I vaguely remember some good material from LGBT Pride Month.  I'll also have something written by Saturday exclusive to the newsletter, but you might guess why I haven't done so, yet.

If I can get to my files in a reasonable time-frame, then the newsletter should mostly look normal.  But if it takes longer, I'll send out a newsletter addendum when I can.

## Stenotype Corner

I'd call this week...interesting.

I managed to get [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/) running on the old machine with far less trouble than I expected, and I've used it for a lot of my usual typing.  That includes at least sections of most recent blog posts, my nightly "wind-down" notes on the day, and so forth.

It still requires me to reach for the laptop keyboard, though, because...go on, guess.  Somehow---possibly due to the age of the machine causing timing problems, maybe a bug in this version (slightly later than what I had on the other computer) of Plover, or whatever---seems to erroneously translate certain words.  Some seem consistently broken, such as the word "didn't" losing the trailing *t*, and any word with an apostrophe seems to aught off there.  Other words seem to only sporadically work.  The software doesn't seem to know that it happens, because it "thinks" that deleting the last word should delete the full length, despite missing letters.

**Last-Minute Update**: It does, in fact, look like this laptop has a timing problem. Setting Plover's *key-press delay* to two milliseconds seems to fix it at the expense of slowing down output a bit.

Anyway, due to that instability, I haven't done any drills on [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/), so I don't know if the increased usage has translated to changes in speed, yet.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

Finally, the code now has the separate CSS---strictly speaking, SASS modules---for the link annotation icons from the various icon fonts.  It looks like it all works, meaning that it should work smoothly when I, or anybody who needs to use the code, need to update the fonts.  And speaking of those annotation icons, the list now has more URLs for NBC-related sites.

Less routine, I updated the [page not found](/blog/404) page somewhat, especially rewriting the "maybe you typed the URL wrong" nonsense to make it feel less condescending.

The asset conversion script now also makes a bit more sense.  The AVIF encoder had started complaining about old syntax, so it now uses `--qcolor 27` to manage the image quality, rather than the more verbose `--min 30 --max 63`, as the encoder program actually suggested.  The script also tries to pay more attention to the folder structure, because it had dumped some files in the wrong spots.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

Now that my note-taking program seems stable, it feels like the time has come to start modernizing the setup, instead of carrying along design decisions from some predecessor.  In particular, storing the notes as [CSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#CSON) feels "of its time," sticking with a format that almost nobody cares about, with shaky support on almost any platform other than CoffeeScript.  And in practice, it only makes the notes more difficult to edit by hand, not *much* more difficult, but still more difficult.

This week marks the start of the process of adding Markdown-based notes to the mix.  At the moment, it only has a YAML library added---for the metadata---and steps taken to include any Markdown files found in with the rest of the notes.

Somebody online asked around about lightweight Markdown note editors, and I realized that I had one, but that I couldn't really suggest it, because of the weird overhead of CSON, if you wanted some insight into why the time has finally come to take care of this.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump a library version for [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton).

## Next

With any luck, I'll have a *lot* to do getting my computer situation squared away.  I also have a few library updates sitting in the queue, and I hope to at least get **Notoboto** reading and writing Markdown-centric notes.  Time permitting, I'd like to also build a "convert this note" feature, so that users who'd prefer---like me, since I don't know that anybody else uses this thing---can phase out the CSON notes without needing to batch-process everything through some script.

And if I can get at my files, *maybe* I can also kick off one of the new projects that I've teased over the last couple of weeks, if they still seem interesting enough.
