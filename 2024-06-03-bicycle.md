* Ignore for ToC

Today, we observe [World Bicycle Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bicycle_Day), recognizing "the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries, and that it is a simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transport."  You'll also now see it connected with the fight against diabetes.

Let's dig into the projects.

## Social Media

As I believe I've mentioned before, Post.News has shut down, so you can't find me there anymore.

I briefly considered replacing it with [Nostr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr), because it looks like a vaguely interesting protocol.  However, as I might have guessed from its insistence on "censorship resistance" and Jack Dorsey's repeated endorsement of it, one look at the timeline showed me that I don't want to spend time anywhere *near* that network.  Posts---and I promise that I don't exaggerate what I saw in the *slightest*---either tried to evangelize cryptocurrency or demanded violence because a jury [found Donald Trump guilty on covering up an affair to interfere in an election](https://www.voanews.com/a/jurors-at-trump-hush-money-trial-deliberating-for-second-day/7634861.html) a couple of hours prior to my visit.

If I wanted *that*, I'd head back to &#x1d54f;.  And yes, I probably *will* use the Unicode math character (`0x1D54F`, Mathematical Double-Struck Capital X) whenever I need to refer to the site[^1] from now on, completely undermining their trademark...undermining it more, I mean, than using a letter of the alphabet as a name and styling it so similarly to the [X.Org Foundation](https://www.x.org/wiki/)'s logo that most people wouldn't notice the difference...

Anyway, I have my data export from Post, but it comes as a JSON file.  I want to and will try to create a readable archive, but will need to look into how best to do that in a readable way.

## The Light's Edge

{% codeberg jcolag/thelightsedge %}

I haven't pushed it to the server, yet, but you should soon start seeing the landing page shape up a bit more, with improved credits, the [tagline promised yesterday]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}), better phrasing, and the addition of the [Free Culture Works logo](https://freedomdefined.org/Logos_and_buttons) and my little JC glyph with the Creative Commons license logo.

The text should also read more clearly, at least in my opinion.  It now specifies that "multimedia" will have a baseline of illustrated prose, and also changes the vague "get involved" to "share the journey."

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

I spent most of my time cleaning up the blog's code, this week.

I've updated a few libraries, to keep things up to date and made sure that I don't deploy scripts when publishing new posts.  Speaking of scripts, they now use more concise syntax where available, in some cases requiring that they change to `bash` instead of `sh` for running them; in 2024, I think that I can finally admit that the newer shell will show up on installations.  Anyway, in cases where the script did move to `bash`, it also now has the same stock boilerplate code at the top as the others, to catch and report errors more usefully and provide for quicker addition of command-line parameters when eventually needed.

Most visibly, though, the styling now keeps post titles on a single line.  It probably looks equally ugly whether it overflows to the next line or stretches beyond the width of the blog's main content, but I've noticed that another line throws off the formatting for the rest of the index page.  The overflow also happens more likely on my machine, because I display the titles of unpublished blog posts surrounded by flying saucer emoji {% emoji ufo %}, making them inevitably wider than what you likely ever see.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for my [**Mastodon Tool Trunk**](https://github.com/jcolag/tool-trunk) and [**Morning Dashboard**](https://github.com/jcolag/dash).

## Next

If I hit on a quick breakthrough for the Post.News archive, I'll prioritize getting that out.  If not, I still have some issues to fix in the blog's code, and my **Morning Dashboard** could use an overhaul in a few spots.

[^1]:  Why don't I still call it Twitter like everybody else seems to?  I go out of my way to call it &#x1d54f;, sometimes "n√©e Twitter," because people still inexplicably have fond feelings for Twitter.  Plus, the fact that the management and community there dislikes the idea of calling people by names that they choose almost demands that we extend them *exactly* the minimal courtesy that they find so abhorrent.  By the way, if you think that your decline in opinion of the site results from the change in management, bear in mind that [Jack Dorsey has abandoned Bluesky to get involved with Nostr](https://wedistribute.org/2024/05/bluesky-jack-dorsey/), due to "free speech maximalism," a phrase that you may have heard before in reference to &#x1d54f;.
