Not what this post revolves around, but during the week, the United States Supreme Court decided---disregarding all science, precedent, and duty of care to fellow humans---to [allow Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-477_2cp3.pdf) to stand.

![Amazon Arena under construction, standing in for an abandoned facility](/blog/assets/11033312525_6b3781a1d8_o.png "It'll make more sense later...I hope")

The decision includes vapid nonsense such as this.

> SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence, regardless of the minor’s sex; it permits providers to administer puberty blockers and hormones to minors of any sex for other purposes.

In other words, this has nothing to do with sex because the ban totally lets you have the same treatments for reasons *other* than someone assigning you the wrong sex at birth.  I mean, a law that exists to enforce sex-assigned-at-birth *sounds* like sex-based discrimination to me, but I guess that nobody ever offered me a law degree, either.

While bad, they don't go as far as they could have, only really saying that (as people who professionally ignore the evidence) they have insufficient evidence of a solid historical trend of documented discrimination against the transgender population to warrant inherently mistrusting laws written to target them under a [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) claim.  I disagree with all of that, but they did keep the ruling shockingly narrow, indicating that the decision does not "judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic" of the law[^1].

[^1]:  Justice Thomas, as always, has a concurrence about how he *would* have gone much further, and whines about how he doesn't trust scientists.  Amy Coney Barrett shows a worrying fear of opening up the range of protected classes.  And Alito says...honestly, it sounds a lot like he disagrees with his colleagues and believes that transgender people have a sufficient history of discrimination, *but* he signed on because he opposes the Fourteenth Amendment and doesn't care about transgender people, and by the way---as with every bit of Alito's writing that I've seen---enumerates a list of other cases that he'd like to overrule on the same basis.  Feel free to skip to page 88 of the decision to read Justice Sotomayor's powerful and actually relevant dissent, if you choose to skim through the mess.

Actually, we have a comic for this, to save me the trouble of five more paragraphs trying to wrestle with transphobia and the right-wing pearl-clutching over somehow expanding human rights to too many people.

![Nose Ears comic #26, Sweeping Generalizations.  Eunice asserts that you can't make sweeping generalizations about trans people.  Mimi counters that all trans people are valid.  Eunice rethinks their position](/blog/assets/NE_en_26_hu4703116701650382992.png "I have no idea why people insist on trying to make it more complicated than this.")

Anyway, I don't have much (more) to write about the decision than that.  But it reminded me that I had this bit of (admittedly lazy) satire sitting in my drafts for a couple of months, now, and the unfortunate ruling felt like as good an excuse to share it as any.

## Battle of the Sexes, Title IX:  No Hope

Many suspect that the destruction of the sport industry began with a single short-sighted, petty move.

> ### Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports
>
> ...This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports...

Critics of the proclamation pointed out that, among other things:

- Transgender women are, in fact, women, by definition.  They put it right in the name.
- Few actual transgender athletes exist in practice.
- The cisgender women competing rarely raise any objection to their transgender teammates and opponents.

They tried to save sports.  It didn't help.

Since nobody has an agreed-upon definition of "demeaning"---certainly not somebody surrounding themselves with incompetent clowns loudly claiming their superiority to everyone else---and nobody could substantiate any means by which the presence of a transgender woman endangers anybody, except as collateral damage from attacks *on* the transgender woman, and because they don't have any relevance to the remainder of the phrasing, activists began to focus on the words "unfair," "excel," and "competitive."

After all, if one *must* accept the highly suspect premise that we need to ban transgender women from sports because they have some inherent advantage---such an idea can only have its roots in the incorrect presumption of "male" genetic superiority in all things, but if we must accept it---then all sports become inherently unfair.  They pointed out the help that Paridhi Subramanium in getting horses across the finish line with her 80 cm stature.  They pointed out Biao Wang's uncanny tentacle-fingers giving him a massive rock-climbing advantage.  And they pointed out how Alessandra Parisi's narrow but dense bone structure made her especially suited to pistol duels.

And if this unsubstantiated and implausible physical advantage to assigning somebody the male gender at birth makes a sport unfair, then *surely*, the argument went, then a sport also shouldn't allow its best athletes.  If male-assigned-at-birth made a hypothetical athlete so much better at every sport as to humiliate their competitors, then what of the giants, the human pistons, or the mutant seal-people?  Presumably, with the prospect of losing their biggest draws and fan-favorite players, even the people who imagine an invasion force lurking behind every trucker cap, they would need to back down.

They didn't.

And so came other orders.

> ### Banning Bigs from B-Ball

Notably, the Supreme Court needed to intervene after this order, ruling eight-to-two, nobody admitting to voting twice, to ban the phrase *race to the bottom*, especially among baseball players whose management assumed that they needed to act as well under the order.

> ### Rebuff the Buff in Lift-up Scuffles

While the Supreme Court didn't need to (no pun intended) weigh in, the market for heavy disks dried up, leaving baker's dozens unemployed.

> ### Pushin' No Rushin' with No Concussion

When people brought up, once again, the damage that traumatic brain injuries do to players, the administration opted to spite them and make the injuries mandatory for play.

> ### Skippin' the Flip(per)s in the Dips

Then the movement became self-sustaining.  Athletes too strong, too fast, too agile, too enthusiastic, populist outrage and executive orders pushed out all of them.  Many started their own divisions and leagues, hoping to still play among their similarly ousted peers, though they could never play together, lest the right-wing government would "help," intervening to make things "fairer."  The League of Extraordinary Skee-ers found that out the hard way, many still serving multiple-life prison sentences long after their deaths for, as the judge put it, "DEI something-or-other, maybe."

After that, scientists showed up in their lab coats, goggles, and clipboards---accounts differ, however, and some identify them as influencers on the defunct GlobaLIA social media platform with no actual credentials---indicating that every athlete has something that sets them apart from their competitors.  Some might have slightly longer arms, or a slightly larger bladder, more experience with a certain situation, or even better hygiene.  It might make a negligible difference, but with the athletes with larger advantages banned from participation, they couldn't say for sure that they didn't decide matches.

And so they had to go, too.

Once again, some tried and failed to found their own leagues and divisions.  Others wrote poetry, such as this anonymous piece.

> First, they came for the mutant seal-people, and I did not speak out---because I too hated the dirty selkie-spawn.
>
> Then they came for the upsettingly tall, and I did not speak out---for I never need to duck under things.
>
> ...

This example goes on like that for another three hundred sixty-two lines.  Oddly or not, most---like the above author---had already long forgotten about the transgender athletes in the rush to purge stars to give non-elite athletes the democratized chance to excel, at least until they became elites themselves.

In the end, the only solution that would satisfy all political requirements put every athlete in their own division or league, with no possible opponents other than what that individual athlete sees in a mirror.  This, they assured us was the only way to protect the integrity of competition.  However, such a move tended to fragment the audience, with even the most ardent fans of a sport unable to follow more than a couple-dozen of matches per day.

For a few weeks, it looked as if Division IV-r Pedro Mohammad Wiśniewski-Kang Northeast Jousting might become popular enough to warrant some press coverage, but the mighty P-Wiz needed to drop his kids off at the pool---literally or metaphorically, nobody has determined---and the journalists drove right past the championship game and straight into a T.J. McWiggleby's parking lot where, according to the receipt displayed with the article after failing to source a photograph of Wisniewski-Kang, they had the funistrada poppers, three bonnacon sandwiches, two starfruit pear astro-cosmopolitans, and midnight cotton candy.

However, the coverage might not have mattered at all, in all likelihood.  Because every athlete performs alone, with no teammates or rivals, every athlete always wins, so every athlete wins their championship, most valuable player awards, and whatever else.  And since conservatives always hated participation trophies even more than they hated transgender women, that scuttled most of the audience for most sports.

From there, attrition took its toll.  The World Pistol Dueling League, Superior League Torque, the National Pillowstrike League, and so forth, all already ailing, all felt forced to sell their thematic-shaped diamond geode conference tables to make rent, and so couldn't adapt to a niche where they could provide support and publicity for much smaller leagues or otherwise capitalize on the market gap.  The myriad leagues-of-one got caught up in labor disputes as athletes realized that they didn't really need much management overhead for teams of one member, occasionally striking until their league management stepped down.  With so many leagues, the only fans watching games tended to come from an athlete's own family, often using free tickets.  Athletes became soft with no competition.  Arenas and stadia fell into disrepair, concession stands bringing in more traffic from animals than humans.

Some rebellious groups attempted to turn back the tide, after a period.  After some applied the same reasoning from sports to solve "The Bathroom Question," decades of every citizen wearing a mandatory bespoke diaper-catheter unit with an in-built surveillance system to monitor the genital contents of the garment at all times, over the objections of those pointing out that healthy people only ever pay attention to their own bodies while using public restrooms, interest in rooting out and shaming transgender individuals began to decline, if only because the diaper-catheter-monitors apparently took up a fair amount of everyone's attention at any given time, and so transgender people could pass through society unnoticed.  But by then, interest in sports had waned even further.  Arenas had crumbled.  Nature reclaimed its stadia, only the likes of voles and feral dogs playing on the field.

Since then, many have lived their entire lives without ever thinking about sports, let alone participating in them.  Unsubstantiated rumors have flooded the GlobaLIA network, describing underground rock-paper-scissor games, or some kid who found an old ball and can bounce it against a wall and catch it, but until those prove true, people can only exert themselves recreationally, with not even a whiff of competition or cooperation with others.

And one must wonder how this all may have turned out differently, had people not openly wet themselves over the possibility of a vanishingly small number of transgender women playing sports...

## Explanations and Apologies

I don't really need to explain this, do I?  Almost out of nowhere, the political right started clutching their pearls over transgender women in women's sports.  It allowed them to perpetuate myths that transgender women have some secret propensity towards violence and, given how few transgender athletes actually compete at any level---most people estimate less than one hundred, out of roughly three hundred forty million residents, or fewer than one out of every three million people[^2], here---it really only serves as a pretext to harass anybody who doesn't strictly conform to gender norms and threaten to police children's genitals.

[^2]:  On the topic of population sizes, I can't help noticing that only about thirty (out of fifty plus a bunch of territories) has the requisite three-and-change million residents where you'd expect to find any examples.  I know that probabilities don't actually work that way, but it does show that a huge swath of politicians have essentially no opportunity to ever even *meet* a transgender athlete, let alone care about how they might impact teammates...

Seeing this as far more important than, say, improving infrastructure, helping war-torn countries negotiate peace settlements, or stopping companies from abusing customers, Donald Trump signed yet another nonsensical executive order, this one [threatening to pull funding from any colleges that allow the---absurdly rare, remember---transgender athletes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/) to participate in women's sports.  You can see in the tiny segment that I quote at the top of the story, that it mostly gives him a platform to misgender the transgender women, and also to level the three (ungrammatical) accusations of demeaning, unfair, and dangerous.

When this nonsense boiled over with [Imane Khelif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif), it confirmed what I said above, that this all has nothing to do with protecting people, and certainly doesn't have anything to do with protecting "integrity" by people who wouldn't know integrity if called out their constant lies, and has everything to do with harassing women who they don't view as sufficiently feminine.  And note that "insufficiently feminine" generally gets aimed at women of color, *purely* by coincidence, I imagine, and certainly not because we built gender norms around whiteness *or* because the same people who want to police gender also see racism as a solution to most problems.

Anyway, in a (brief) conversation about Khelif that I had, I made the point that, *if* we accept that Khelif shouldn't box because with short hair in a baseball cap and wearing no make-up somebody could mistake her (as with many women) for a young man---and I most emphatically do **not** accept such an outlandish premise---then didn't [Manute Bol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manute_Bol)'s enormous stature give him an advantage in basketball when he could have plausibly dunked a ball about as comfortably as anybody might scratch their heads?  What about [Michael Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps) with his longer torso and arms, and hyperextended joints?  Should people with traits like those compete when it gives them much larger advantages[^3]?

[^3]:  I should note, however, that they don't mind if you *cheat*, as evidenced by the [posthumous reinstatement of Pete Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Reinstatement) to Major League Baseball, with Trump's vocal support, after almost certainly betting for and against the team that he managed.  By their rules, manipulating your own team's failure for personal benefit (not to mention tax evasion) protects the integrity of competition so much that it should get you into the Hall of Fame---though they tried to suggest that every death redeemed any expulsion by also reinstating ["Shoeless Joe" Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson)---but not identifying as the gender assigned to you at birth should wreck your entire team's finances.

That set me on the path to this story, which I think *fully* "protects the integrity" of competition, unlike some weak-willed demagogues.  They thought that they had a problem with participation trophies now, wait until they reap what they've sown...

### Credits

As for the references that I made along the way to things other than Trump executive orders, I believe the following covers everything.

- Near the end of my introduction, we have [**Nose Ears** #26, *Sweeping Generalizations*](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/comic/26/), also used in the [Free Culture Book Club post on the comic]({% post_url 2025-03-29-nose-ears-1 %}).  And by the way, a hearty congratulations and best wishes to Wuzzy (the creator), who published a solid thousand of the comics and took that opportunity to end the run on a high.  I look forward to seeing what they do next.
- The story's title, apart from mentioning the exaggerated fight over gender norms, uses [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) to imply a franchise sequel.
- I did, in fact, consider rendering the executive order titles in [Instrument Serif](https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif), but couldn't see another use for the joke in the future, and it looks like such an eyesore...
- [Pistol dueling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol_dueling) actually somehow had a moment as a competitive sport rather than a bloodsport to preserve some vague idea of personal honor, even having a brief stint at the Olympics.
- American football, and to a lesser extent many sports, had a series of [significant scandals](https://theconversation.com/all-is-not-well-in-the-world-of-intercollegiate-football-46306) regarding the treatment of players, most especially allowing/forcing players with traumatic brain injuries and covering up the incidents.  And then society collectively decided to stop talking about it.
- [GlobaLIA](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Dan-o-Roc.html) comes from one of the Fictopedia worlds, made available under a CC BY 3.0 license.  Not that it appears in the story text, but for a behind-the-scenes peek, I initially considered using [Tox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox_%28protocol%29) as the platform, which never saw much use, as far as I know, and had an early history mired in petty scandals.  But I decided that I'd rather not offend any real users of the system.
- Not Free Culture, but through the magic of Fair Use doctrine, I opted to parody the famous [*First They Came*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Came), no disrespect intended, *except* to the people who have spent the last few decades insisting that the poem applied to their minor problems.  And like that poem, this one also conveniently forgets that, in fact, they [first came for the transgender folks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_people_in_Nazi_Germany), because people who ascribe to patriarchal power structures can never tolerate people who don't fit into a neat gender binary.
- T.J. McWiggleby's makes an appearance in [**Uncle Nagy's House**]({% post_url 2021-02-06-nagy %}) by Spoon Full of Poo, made available under a CC BY 4.0 license.  Perhaps unfairly, I modeled the restaurant side-trip on the investigative podcast trope of giving us full audio of the journalist *failing* to get the story, knocking on doors with no answer, missing calls, driving down roads, and so forth.
- [Funistrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funistrada) comes from a United States Army survey, circulated around 1974, a fictional food along with two others to measure how seriously soldiers actually took the survey.  As a work of the United States government, it exists in the public domain, and (I have decided) at T.J. McWiggleby's, it comes in appetizer form.
- [Bonnacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnacon) appear in various legends as a kind of bovine creature that defends itself by launching either acidic or flaming feces, definitely the best of all fantasy creatures.
- Starfruit Pear Astro-Cosmo comes from the aforementioned Fictopedia, a [Mr. Chittermeyer](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Mr._Chittermeyer.html) soft drink flavor, here implied to have an off-brand cocktail inspired by it.

- Torque comes from [**Torque Arena:  The Solarpunk Sport of Grit & Glory**](https://unplayablegamesrpg.itch.io/torque-arena) (though I doubt that many solarpunk fans will agree, personally) by Alessandro Piroddi, made available under a CC BY 4.0 license.
- Pillowstrike comes from the [Menza Games](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Menza_Games.html) entry on the aforementioned Fictopedia.
- The "diamond geode" conference tables lampoon the enormous emounts of money that "non-profit" sports leagues sit on, that they throw money away on such things.  Alas, I wouldn't actually call it much of an exaggeration.

With that, have a happy Pride Month {% emoji rainbow flag %}, everybody, and stay safe.
