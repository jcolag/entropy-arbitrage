As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

For at least a decade, I can't think of a more frustrating aspect of American politics than politicians who demand that we "run government like a business," but have apparently never seen a *successful* business.

If you have an interest in twentieth-century technology, look up this engineer.  He died at the age of forty, but still somehow managed to get a pile of patents to his name, describing almost every detail of building an old tube television.  And showing part of how he must have lived, the Patent Office consistently gets his name wrong, even though he (necessarily) lists it on the documents that he submits.

I don't think that I knew that Ethiopia had a shockingly bloody civil war in recent history.  While I do realize that certain conflicts almost automatically get better media coverage than anything happening in Africa, this still feels like something that should have gotten some coverage...

For the record, I do not regret the pun.  I *do* regret that the pun makes it look like the point of the post, rather than my annoyance at people who declare Mastodon "unusable," every time a feature confuses them.  It seems especially embarrassing, when they *still* spout their "you need to pick a server, and nobody has ever faced such a difficult decision" nonsense.

See the foregoing about running government like a business.  Even literal Nazi-sympathizer Henry Ford wanted to help his employees out of debt with good wages, so that his employees could become *customers*.

Personally, I don't need to worry about student debt.  I went to school on a scholarship, and paid off my minimal loans shortly after graduation.  If I hadn't, I graduated long enough ago that I either would have paid them off *or*, if my career hadn't gone so well, at least had the opportunity to give up and declare bankruptcy.  Regardless of the lack of impact to me, I support debt forgiveness for the same reason that I support any public service:  Investing in public infrastructure means increasing economic activity.

I only live *near* New York City, not within its borders, but I will never understand how Eric Adams made it through the mayoral primary, with a basket of policies that all seemed directly antagonistic to his constituents.  More "running government like a business," particularly a failing business that wants to spend more while alienating its customers.

I do occasionally worry about influxes of new Cohost users, potentially turning it into yet another space where people compete to post the most incendiary meme about politics, instead of having conversations.  But I also realize that I don't follow any politics tags over there, and unless I follow someone, I don't see posts without tags that I follow, so it should have *some* level of safety.

Regardless, it does please me to see "serious" people start to recognize the site as useful for some types of people.  While privately owned, they organized [Anti-Software Software Club](https://antisoftware.club/) as a non-profit, so I doubt that a billionaire will buy Cohost to silence its community.  I can't say the same about Post, Spoutible, or any others beyond decentralized Mastodon and (not that it'll ever show up in an article) Scuttlebutt.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I think that I can set aside April 31<sup>st</sup> for celebrating Confederate Heritage.  Certainly, I didn't have other plans, what with the date not existing, and all...

Long-time readers presumably already know that I use stories like this as an opportunity to take a grim "victory lap," since I've often talked about how corporate social media gets its value from wild assertions that anger supporters and frighten opponents.  Even long before Twitter's change in {% sfx ahem %} "management," QAnon-like material would have quickly climbed up the priority list.
