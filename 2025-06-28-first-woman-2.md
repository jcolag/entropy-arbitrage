This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **First Woman**, *Expanding Our Universe*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Content Advisories:  Brief danger

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Expanding Our Universe

NASA described the comic as follows.

> Dream to Reality follows Callie's trailblazing path as the first woman on the Moon. Callie and her robot sidekick, RT, overcome setbacks, disappointment, and tragedy along the way. From her childhood dreams of space travel to being selected as an astronaut candidate, Callie takes us on her journey to the Moon.

For this post, I read the comic, but didn't touch any of the augmented/extended reality parts.

I should note that I actually only know that these comics exist, because the Trump administration had the comics removed from NASA's website via his [anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/), which imagines that hiring practices that look beyond white men as candidates, or even acknowledging the existence of other people as this does, amount to "illegal and immoral discrimination programs."  From that perspective, I guess that the executive order did something good, drawing attention to some important content.

And yes, technically we already talked about NASA material with the [**Lost Universe**]({% post_url 2024-05-04-lost-universe %}) role-playing adventure, but this has different creators at an entirely different group within the agency, an offshoot of the [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) rather than the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope).

## What Works Well?

We actually get to know the characters, this time, rather than focusing most of our actual attention on the robot.  And while they all have either symbolic or stereotypical backgrounds, depending on how generous you feel, they mostly seem plausible, *especially* in their (real world) positions of encouraging young people to get involved.

In addition, the Lunar Outpost seems more reasonable, this time around.  Granted, we had a five-year jump between issues, so the situation may have changed dramatically, but their structure now feels like a base of operations for missions, rather than someplace for Callie to send updates.

I should also call out the resolution to the secondary crisis, here.  We've seen the "do we risk running out of fuel on the way, or do we wait for help with a ticking countdown" trope in almost every science fiction franchise.  But I don't think that I've ever seen before seen a version where they balance regulations with careful energy calculations.  It especially compares well against the previous issue's similar but more reckless "disable the safety mechanism to get home in time" resolution.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

It feels fairly pathetic that their big example of international cooperation limits itself to having a Canadian (who doesn't even rate a *surname*) tag along with the American crew.  If they only wanted a generic white guy, they could've gone a lot further than next door to give a global feel.

Also, I don't actually know enough about living on the Moon to know how realistic this seems, but as a reader, the crises feel contrived.  Every problem comes out of nowhere and might kill everybody, but then passes without much incident.

## Opportunities

As mentioned, the Trump administration has, in effect, banned any government work that acknowledges that women and non-white folks---to say nothing about intersectionality---have at least the same qualifications as the white boy dingbats making official policy on unsecured devices and failing to preserve the records.  Therefore, you can probably best support this project by getting these sorts of people out of office and replacing them with people who'll properly fund science and education initiatives.

I know.  Some casual reader or other probably finds it disappointing that I turned to partisan politics for this.  But:

- You can't exactly donate five bucks, fix things in a Forgejo repository, or leave encouraging comments when we live in a world where one political party wants to make the acknowledgement of female astronauts a *debate*, while transferring funding from the public agencies doing this work to private corporations that made "rapid unscheduled disassembly" a household term.
- Free Culture revolves around cooperation, and so has an *inherent* (largely liberal) politics to it.

When that aggressing party stops trying to erase projects like this, *I* can stop talking about opposing them politically to get more work like this.

## What's Adaptable?

This issue introduces us to fellow astronauts Meshaya Billy and Martin (no surname), and the Moon Radio Telescope.  The updated two-wheeled robots receive the new name "rim rovers," and the mission in this issue gets named [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) 23, implying that the events take place substantially after the planned Artemis X in 2035[^1].  A further-in-the-future Mars mission, ten years out from the events in the first issue, also closes out the issue, though we don't learn much about it.

[^1]:  Possibly much later, really, considering that NASA's Inspector General called ten missions in ten years [unrealistic](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fy-2025-budget-request-summary-updated.pdf).

The telescope seems to specifically adapt the proposed [Lunar Crater Radio Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Crater_Radio_Telescope) (LCRT).

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll read the **Soul Space** role-playing game setting.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic?
