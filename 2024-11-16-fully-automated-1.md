This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Fully Automated!**, looking at the gameplay mechanics and world guide.

![The book's cover, featuring a cat-lady with sunglasses vaulting backwards over two armed people on small flying machines over a disrupted market](/blog/assets/fully-automated-cover.png "I feel like the cover promises us body-modification furries that the text doesn't bother to pay off")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Fully Automated!**
 * Location:  <https://fullyautomatedrpg.com/>
 * Released:  2023 (?)
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Andrew R. Gross and others
 * Medium:  Role-playing game
 * Length:  Approximately two hundred sixty pages
 * Content Advisories:  Suggested violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Fully Automated

The website's [answers page](https://fullyautomatedrpg.com/get-answers/) describes the game as follows.

 > Fully Automated is a tabletop role-playing game designed to provide a certain set of tools and stories that the creators of this game couldn’t previously find elsewhere.
 >
 > The game is meant to allow players to go on street-level adventures in a solarpunk future. If you’re not familiar, solarpunk is a genre adjacent to cyberpunk, but which largely challenges and inverts most of its dominant themes. It envisions a world in which technology and our societies are brought into harmony with nature. It rejects cynicism about the futility of fighting to challenge power structures. In place of themes of scarcity and selfishness, it imagines abundance shared convivially. And in place of a nihilistic view that life is valueless, it imagines not just that every person is priceless, but that personhood can be granted to far more things than just humans. But while it is growing fast, tools for running solarpunk tabletop games are still too few.

It goes on to explain that, unlike many genres, solarpunk needs more source material to make people comfortable devising new situations, hence the long page-counts across multiple books.

Speaking of "multiple books," note that we *won't* touch the supplemental two hundred pages of adventures and campaign information.  But by the same token, if you want more about this world, the team has quite a bit more available.

Oh, and I should probably mention that I should have divided this book differently.  It feels much longer than I think that the word- or page-count might imply, and that may have led me to not always give things a fair shake.  Even if I did treat it all fairly, this post feels over-packed.

## What Works Well?

Mechanically, it stood out to me that the game has (loose) rules for characters who want to work "off-screen," in what they call Interstitial parts of the story.  Characters need to travel, sleep, and so forth, and it feels clever to say that the game continues, even though none of the players will get involved.

While I would only use it as a starting point for further reading, I do have to admit that---in some contexts---the setting could make a decent introduction to economic ideas such as [Georgism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism) and [communitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitarianism).

And as you can probably already see below, I see a bunch of structural problems with the setting,  However, while this might differ with personal taste, I at least appreciate the overall concept, here.  And more importantly, the flaws in the system *could* represent opportunities for a more interesting game world than taking it at its world that everything works so well.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

While I didn't spend much time reading through the mechanical aspects of the game, it feels *off* for the game to spend time explaining how to change those mechanical aspects.  It also feels haphazard, in how it throws in items like character "levels," which have structured definition but no apparent relevance...actually, multiple kinds of levels.

Similarly, while the game claims to have developed its ideas in ignorance of the solarpunk movement, a lot of people who identify with the ideas of the movement will find a lot of the ideas disconnected.  In particular, the mechanical sections spend a lot of time on combat and the characters becoming "legendary heroes" in the world, which seem both opposed to the movement in general and the book's own statements that people find themselves increasingly in tune with their environment and communities.  And while I realize that, game-wise, violence probably seems inevitable, the depth of the combat system seems like the jarring aspect, not its presence.

In the history, I can't help notice---much like [**Let's Move Forward**]({% post_url 2023-06-24-move-forward %}) for its similar world---how much the world relies on right-wing tropes for its better world, such as the collapse of the United States into smaller countries (but also silently co-opting Mexico and Canada), the need to explore frontiers, technology solving all material problems, a communist society where people still somehow need money, skepticism of government, the suggestion that immigrants have some natural opposition to government, and so forth.  Seemingly connected with this, the book suggests the idea of restorative justice, but issues a variety of exceptions that drift into how prisons still need to exist for all the murderers.

Likewise, the description of the economy makes me extremely uncomfortable.  While I like the idea of working out an equitable economic system, and would support many aspects of what they propose, this instance perpetuates so many capitalist institutions.  Characters need to pay taxes, take out bank loans, go into debt, and so forth.  But the text constantly implores us not to worry, because *nobody* would ever economically exploit somebody else, and everybody has public finances, so neighbors will probably help out if you get into trouble.  Oh, and the neighbors might also force you to move into worse quarters, if they don't like you for whatever reason[^1], but don't worry about swindlers.

[^1]:  No, really.  Page 165, "A common example includes building co-ops seeking to convince or compel empty-nesters or residents who under-contribute to their building to downsize by moving to a smaller apartment in the building," followed immediately by "Well-liked neighbors are usually given a pass on low occupancy issues. Many will regularly host guests for neighbors to maintain favor."  The community [redlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) you based on "vibes," leaving plenty of room for overt discrimination.

## What's Adaptable?

The Seeker faith seems like the most prominent idea, though the world has a mostly plausible future history.  We also get the various "service organizations," the world's attempts to replace police departments without changing too much, for their future Los Angeles.  It does the same for media outlets, but inexplicably uses a lot of real-world outlets.  The landmark book **Peanuts, Power, and the Future** also makes the list.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll finish up **Fully Automated!**, at least the main book.  I'll focus on *Inhabiting the World*, then skim *Resources for GMs*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
