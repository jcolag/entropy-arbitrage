This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **Antumbra**, chapter 0.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Content Advisories:  References to massacre and purges, weapons

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Antumbra

The "back cover" of the comic describes its story as follows.

 > In a bleak not-so-distant future, authoritarian governments and mega-corporations dominate a humanity that has devolved into a cesspool of social stagnation.  Rid, a timid individual and an exceptional scientist, catches the attention of *Antumbra*, a clandestine organization with an agenda that threatens to plunge the world into chaos.  The person pulling Rid's strings, the head of this organization, starts enacting their plans, by entangling him in the plots of the government, the military, and corporations.  This is a saga of evolution, of fates intertwined, and of how the choices of one man can reverberate through the foundations of human society.

While it won't make much difference for these few pages, it looks like manga conventions apply, reading panels and word balloons to the right before those to the left.

Note that we have (for once) gotten to a Free Culture work fairly early.  The author posted this introductory chapter at the end of May, and they have regularly posted previews on individual pages.  While its newness might make this an unfair assessment as more chapters come out, I decided that I'd rather risk that than wait and present it as yet another old project.  (Plus, I don't want to presume anything about the license on future chapters.)

If you recognize the name in Free Culture circles, then you *may* have read the creator's [*...* comic](https://fodongo.jectoons.net/2024/05/20/issue-6-by-n-toyohito/) from the sixth issue of **Fodongo**.  I haven't the foggiest idea if the two stories will have any actual relationship, but I note the biotechnology "vibe" of both maybe hinting at it, a bit.

## What Works Well?

In only a few pages, the comic does a fairly good idea of indicating what sort of story that we have ahead of us.  I don't understand a couple of the details, but this exists entirely to set up the future, so I imagine that we'll get answers soon enough.  Likewise, we get names for a bunch of characters, some of whom seem to have interesting properties.

I also see potential in the art style, realistic enough to make things feel harsh, while also looking flexible enough that the tone could change quickly without much of a problem.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I feel like dedicating one quarter of the introduction to the title *might* have gone too far, especially when the blurb suggests a far more interesting world in store for us.

## Opportunities

You can pay what you want for the comic on Itch, and the credits page includes the following.

 > If you like this work and want to support:

And it lists contact information.

## What's Adaptable?

Including the blurb, we get the Antumbra organization, the recent societal destruction, and a list of maybe-interesting characters.

## Coming Attractions[^2]

[^2]:  It seems long past time to give this section a useful name, right?

Coming up next week, we'll listen to music by Morrisa Jeanine, a sampling of tracks from their albums.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic?
