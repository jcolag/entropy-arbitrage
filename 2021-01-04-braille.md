Today, as perhaps implied by the post title, is World [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) Day, celebrating the writing system on [Louis Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille)'s birthday.

On with the code!

## Picture to Nonogram

I finished the most basic version of the program.  At the end of the run, there's a grid for comparison purposes, the runs of dark pixels by row, and the runs of dark pixels by column.  An example of the latter two follows.

```JSON
[
  [ 16 ],      [ 7, 8 ],
  [ 7, 8 ],    [ 6, 7 ],
  [ 7, 7 ],    [ 4, 1, 3 ],
  [ 3, 5, 3 ], [ 3, 9, 2 ],
  [ 3, 9, 2 ]
]
[
  [ 9 ],    [ 9 ],    [ 9 ],
  [ 6 ],    [ 5, 2 ], [ 5, 3 ],
  [ 3, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 3, 3 ],
  [ 5, 3 ], [ 5, 2 ], [ 5, 2 ],
  [ 5, 2 ], [ 7 ],    [ 9 ],
  [ 9 ]
]
```

That's enough information to solve the puzzle, but I doubt it's enough information to even begin to guess what the source image might have been.  It's a decent start.

Anyway, I also added some code to enforce a minimum size to the grid---since passing in a square image produces a 1x1 image, which fails to be useful---and did some minor refactoring.

## Library Updates

My [generic board game](https://github.com/jcolag/generic-board-game) code (that hasn't actually happened) needed a library bumped, so I took care of that, too.

## Next

I want to also find a way to set a maximum size of images, since a 1921x1080 image is more than a bit unwieldy.  This should probably push out to an actual puzzle to solve, including grabbing a random (Free Culture) image to process, too.  It also might not be a bad idea to find a way to (usefully) iterate over the transformation to monochrome, to test with different values to get a puzzle that's likely to be fun.
