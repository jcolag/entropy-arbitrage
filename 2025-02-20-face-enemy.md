## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Face of the Enemy

Catching you up, Romulans kidnapped Troi and made her look like one of them to pose as an intelligence operative.  Also, we spent way too much time on her pantomime routine trying to find a light-switch.

Catching you up more broadly in the franchise, this episode comes shortly after *Q-Less*, featuring the return of Vash from [*Captain's Holiday*]({% post_url 2023-09-07-captain-s-holiday %}) and [*Q Pid*]({% post_url 2024-03-21-qpid %}), but also featuring Sisko punching Q in the face.

 > **TORETH**: I have been ordered to take on cargo, but its contents are unknown to me. Does that seem wise? I am responsible for the safety of this ship and its crew. How do I know this cargo is safe to transport?

You might recognize Toreth as the prolific [Carolyn Seymour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Seymour), who we've seen in smaller roles in [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %}) and [*First Contact*]({% post_url 2024-02-15-first-contact %}), and will show up a couple of times on **Voyager**.  These days, you'll more likely hear her voice in video games.

You might *also* recognize that, despite the insistence on the inhumanity of the Romulans, Toreth cares about her crew.  And later, she'll "deplore the loss" of eighteen civilians, a sentiment that I don't think that we've ever heard Picard or Riker express, unless each one counted as a Federation citizen and the plot used them to motivate the crew's violence towards the enemy of the week.

 > **RIKER**: Ensign DeSeve, by order of Starfleet Command I am placing you under arrest for treason.

They seem almost obsessively angry at the human who dared join up with the Romulans, far more concerned about punishing him than whatever he has to say.  On one hand, I can vaguely understand it, since he defected twenty years ago.  But also, they hold *serious* grudges against people who they feel have abandoned the Federation, echoing a lot of the talk that introduced [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}).

 > **DESEVE**: Yes, Captain. I have a message from Ambassador Spock. He said it involves further cowboy diplomacy. He said you would understand. There's a Corvallen freighter arriving in the Kaleb sector in the next twelve hours. Spock wants you to rendezvous with that ship, bring its cargo back to Federation space.

This story, in other words, serves as a sequel to [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-06-27-unification-part-1 %}).

 > **DESEVE**: The Romulans are very moral, Captain. They have an absolute certainty about what is right and what is wrong, who is a friend and who is an enemy, a strict moral compass which provides them with a clarity of purpose. At one time I found their sense of purpose, their passion and commitment, to be very compelling.

That sounds enough like the Federation that we've seen here that I wonder what difference he saw.  Even *this episode* features a lot of racist sentiment against Romulans, on the basis that somebody marked them as an official enemy of the Federation (and Klingon Empire).

 > **TROI**: You're part of Ambassador Spock's underground movement.

Well, the underground movement already existed, in all fairness.  Spock really only co-opted it after visiting.  It goes to show how the Federation views the movement.

 > **N'VEK**: We are due in the ward room shortly. The senior officers always dine together.

I feel like I should note how the modern franchise has made "senior officers dine together" some weird mark of civilization.  But other than that one failed attempt in [*Time Squared*]({% post_url 2023-02-16-time-squared %}), the Romulans seem to have gotten there first...

 > **TORETH**: Contrary to the propaganda that your superiors would have us believe, Starfleet is neither weak nor foolish. The chances of us reaching Draken undetected are not good.

I find it interesting that the Federation casts the Romulans as the devious minds behind every terrible thing in the galaxy, while---except on the front line---the Romulans apparently see the Federation as bumbling and useless.  That seems like it underscores the impression that we've gotten that Starfleet has mostly invented or at least wildly exaggerated the Romulan threat, because if they really wanted to invade, they'd probably take on a "weak" and "foolish" opponent.

 > **PICARD**: Then the Romulans could still be in the vicinity.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Red alert. Shields at maximum.

Note that it took them exactly "Romulans could show up" seconds to prepare for war.  Troi lectured Toreth on the importance of diplomatic responses and reasoning, but apparently never considered broaching the topic with her own boss.

 > **TROI**: We're not playing it your way anymore, N'Vek. I've been kidnapped, surgically altered, put in danger I've gone along with all your plans. Now you are going to listen to me. You find a way to let the Enterprise track us, or I will go to Toreth and tell her I've discovered you're a traitor. I'll order you ejected into space. Is that clear, Sub-commander?

Like in [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}), Troi believes that bullying translates into leadership.

## Conclusions

We don't really get much out of this episode, except for Carolyn Seymour, maybe.

### The Bad

A lot of what we learn in this episode quietly involves showing us that the Romulans seem pretty nice, largely caring people, despite how people in the Federation see them.  The Federation seems to deny the autonomy of the Romulans, seeing the reform movement as belonging to Spock, one of their people.  For their part, many Romulans see the Federation as weak and foolish, suggesting that the Romulans have no interest in invasions, while the crew arms up at the slightest possibility of sharing space.

At least members of Starfleet see it as a personal affront when people defect from the Federation to rival powers.

And we continue to see the Federation's dismal approach to leadership.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next time, when we find out how ~~Scrooge~~ Picard lost his heart, in *Tapestry*.
