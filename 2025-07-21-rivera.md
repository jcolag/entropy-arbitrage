Today, Puerto Rico observes---as a Monday holiday, so don't expect accuracy, here---the birthday of [Luis Muñoz Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Mu%C3%B1oz_Rivera), with the actual anniversary of his birth back on Thursday.  Primarily, we remember him because of his role in prying control over the island from Spain.  He resigned from office when the United States set up a military government, instead working to improve the island's governance framework until his death.

With that, on to the week's projects.

## Argh, Part 5

Things continue to shape up, I think.

### Mini-Server, Part 3

I have my first Pyrrhic victory to report, this week.  In looking at my web usage from the perspective of "what would I miss if my Internet connection fell off for a while"---not uncommon during storm seasons---I thought of [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/), a usually excellent alternative to the commercial machine-translation services.  I use various installations of the code around the Internet, but I use the code regularly enough that a tree taking out a major line or a fire at the ISP might impact how I handle non-English Free Culture works, for example.

On that front, I have good news and bad news.  Good, it installs like a dream, after you push past Python's "nobody should actually install things with Python tools" garbage.  Install it, run it, and you can set up `systemd` and `nginx` or the equivalents to serve it correctly.  Unfortunately, though, the Raspberry Pi can't really handle the load.  It took two tries---the user interface crashed my browser, in the first round---and about three minutes to translate *les trois petits cochons*...the four-word phrase, I mean, not the entire story.

That won't do.  If I ever build a larger server for the house, I'll consider it again, but I ditched the service for now.

Another failure on my part, I wanted to find a replacement RSS feed reader.  I don't mind [RSS Guard](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard), but the lack of filtering by tag---too many outlets that I follow run a ton of sports gossip and/or native advertising---and its general memory consumption make it more difficult to work with than I'd like, and I do have the server.

In this case, the problems come from architecture.  Lightweight feed readers exist that have all the features that I want, but they all build for a full database management system, whether MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.  I have no interest in installing a rather massive server for probably the lightest-weight task.  And if I mandate something lighter, such as SQLite, then I lose related features like an API, filtering, or sometimes even a user interface.  Without a user interface, I *could* set up a feed reader client, but...then I have my current setup with an extra point of failure.

Will that frustration spur me to write my own?  Only time will tell.  However, I do note that Go, a language that I generally don't care about, has native HTTP handling, parallelism that would work well for grabbing a bunch of feeds at once, a well-known library for flexibly processing feeds, and well-known SQLite libraries.  I don't *want* to take on a project like that, but it does tempt me to at least throw together a prototype...

#### The Point

I should maybe reiterate why I've gone through all this, and why I seem to keep going. It sounds like some inane self-sufficiency nonsense, but at least the core services---Code Server, Cryptpad, Forgejo, Inf Cloud, Jellyfin, Radicale, and Snappy Mail, to recap---I chose to free up my laptop, giving me something with the responsiveness similar to a slow local machine, but without bogging my own machine down. It also gives me small things to learn.

For example, I also got [Own Tracks](https://owntracks.org/), to see if I can get enough geographic data to mess with, as I walk day after day.

### Resettlement, Part 2

Good news and bad news here, as well.

Extremely promising, the suspiciously cheap RAM that I bought got the Framework laptop to start up and attempt to boot.  I half-expected to find out that it had some weird proprietary lock that would only allow me to use it in some one-off device only manufactured for the military, so it comes as a pleasant surprise that it actually works.

Putting a crimp in my plans, though, it won't boot from the previous laptop's SSD hard drive, with no indication of why.  As I mentioned, I bought the previous machine with a second drive that I never used, so I can presumably install an operating system on that.  That'll require tracking down a USB drive big enough to hold a modern Linux and setting up a completely fresh computer, though, which sets back plans slightly more than if I could have booted into the environment that I had running about a month ago.

I might have the end in sight on this, though.  I mean, I'll probably continue with the home server, and will presumably want to upgrade the memory[^2] from whatever my ten bucks (or whatever I paid) bought me a couple of weeks ago, but with any luck, we can soon put an end to my whining about this decade-old laptop...

[^2]:  You might rightly question why I haven't pulled the RAM out of the dead laptop, if only to see if it'll fit.  And I'd love to do that, except the repair/upgrade instructions mysteriously don't mention the RAM, so all the "pull off the back cover and go" advice online wastes time.

## Stenotype Corner

Again, I have nothing to report, here, other than that I have used the keyboard for probably about a third of my typing.  I did run across a couple of words that didn't seem to translate correctly no matter what I tried, but until I have a solution---yes, I tried to find other entries that might block what I wanted---it doesn't seem much more than petty to shout about some possible minor bug in Plover.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

At this point, every new or changed note should have a readable name based on the title. The code converts the name to lowercase, removes all stop-words and similar terms, joins the remaining words with hyphens, removes accent and diacritical marks---pretty much exactly what I wrote about in my early [post dealing with so-called metal umlauts]({% post_url 2019-12-17-metal-umlauts %}), in fact, but in a new language---and adds a [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec), the last to make sure that every note has a unique (and readable) name, even with colliding titles. ULIDs takes up less space than a UUID[^1], sorting provides a relative ordering with a reverse-engineerable time stamp, and has a Tcl implementation.

[^1]:  I also considered [nanoID](https://zelark.github.io/nano-id-cc/) and [CUID2](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2), but the former didn't seem good enough at avoiding collisions, the latter didn't look stable, and either would require me to write the library in Tcl.

For my most extreme example, I have an old note for [**The Poles / Dhuru Vangal / துருவங்கள்**]({% post_url 2023-08-19-poles-1 %}). Running that title through the new code gives me a prospective filename of `poles-dhuru-vangal-01K0FAY47E49D38CKD3JW8P5BB.md` (note the Tamil text removed), or did back on Friday. For [**Trois écoles**]({% post_url 2025-07-12-trois-ecoles-1 %}), I got `trois-ecoles-01K0DEPWW0ZE3HC087XSMWTSHQ.md` (note the accent removed from the *e*) on Thursday.

Note that stripping non-ASCII characters, to ditch any accent marks and emoji, as you can see, does mean that any non-Latin characters will get lost. That feels OK for now, since I don't believe that I have any users who don't live with me, but I want to revisit it for potential titles with, say, Chinese or Arabic words in them. But the normalized names work well with git tooling, so I want to pick trade-offs carefully.

I should note that both the stop-words and the ULID work introduced me to the `source` command, which reads another Tcl script into memory to allow for more modular code.  I didn't want my three hundred-plus stop-word list cluttering up the main source code, so it lives in its own file for somebody else to borrow.  Likewise, the ULID library downloaded as a Tcl file.

Also, many buttons have equivalents on the menu, and all menu items have their icons moved to the left of the text, which makes them easier to read.

Other than that, I believe that **Notoboto** once again does most of what I want, for now, though I reserve the right to change my mind in a few minutes...

## Next

I might want to modify the layout of the **Notoboto** screen layout to work better on smaller screens like I have on this laptop.  And I'd like a way to handle the title-to-filename process when the title includes words in non-Latin scripts, if I can find a way that doesn't require some monster external application.  Actually, now that I've used the `source` command to modularize the code, I should seriously consider extracting all that old CSON code into its own file, too, in case anybody ever needs to reuse it.

Also, I may have some small adjustments to make to the blog.  After that, I don't have much of a plan, so we'll see where the mood takes me.
