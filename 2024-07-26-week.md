As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > While the kind of training deployed during the Montgomery bus boycott in the mid-1950s spread throughout the civil rights movement, its power was perhaps best demonstrated during the Mississippi Freedom Summer campaign of 1964. Northern volunteers ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî were recruited to go to that state to do grassroots activism.

 > The result is unequal access to medicines across Europe, with life-saving medicines out of reach in some countries. At the same time, pharmaceutical companies are reporting huge profits, often from medicines that were developed in their early stages with public money. Forbes lists the healthcare industry as the second of its top five sectors to invest in.

In fairness, I think that we all knew that Big Pharma did things like this, but as always, I like having studies to gesture at when making a point, instead of working from "vibes."

 > But punishing people for our country‚Äôs failure to ensure adequate housing for all is inherently ‚Äúcruel and unusual.‚Äù Widespread homelessness directly violates the human right to housing under international law, which must be recognized in the United States.

Hashtags:  #Housing #Inequality

You might notice that we keep finding out shocking things, like how you solve homelessness by housing people and solve poverty by giving people money.  But because we (at least in the United States) have an entire political party dedicated to the idea that you can only become poor by making terrible life decisions---and that wealthy people only make great life decisions---we pretend that this can't possibly work or point to one sabotaged project and insist that we can never try it again, while they try to privatize public utilities again...

 > ...children in families with low economic resources were getting less sleep at night and going to sleep later compared with children in families with higher economic resources. In turn, shorter sleep and going to sleep later were associated with reduced amygdala size and weaker connections between the amygdala and other emotion-processing brain regions.

We all knew that it'd happen, I suppose, and the suit has more runway to go, but we still need to put an end to this blatant corruption.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}
{% embed https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2000/2024/07/sticker-mule-logo-dark-stacked.png|Screenshot of Sticker Mule's emergency message|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Sticker Mule in Marketing Email: ‚ÄòDonald Trump Was Shot ‚Ä¶ Btw, get 1 Shirt for $4 (normally $19)‚Äô](https://www.404media.co/sticker-mule-in-marketing-email-donald-trump-was-shot-btw-get-1-shirt-for-4-normally-19/) from 404 Media

 > The company posted the same message without the t-shirt discount note to its Instagram alongside a photo of Trump raising his fist immediately after being shot in the ear. ‚ÄúDonald Trump was shot,‚Äù the message reads in part. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what your political views are but the hate for Trump and his supporters has gone too far ‚Ä¶ awesome people, all over the world, love Trump. Don‚Äôt limit your friendships and diminish your happiness by indulging in political hate.‚Äù

I disagree with the article's implication that companies expressing political views makes things worse, since people now know not to support this particular company when competitors exist, but it did do the best job of drawing attention to the actual message.  Certainly, if I ever release stickers for a project---unlikely as that feels, given how I've never cared for the things---I'll find someone better than a market leader that would rather emote about "the left" than find out what actually happened...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [So you want to compete with or replace open source](https://drewdevault.com/2024/07/16/2024-07-16-So-you-want-to-compete-with-FOSS.html) from Drew DeVault's blog

 > What these efforts generally have in common is a desire to change the commercial dynamic of source-available software. In other words, the movers and shakers in these movements want to get paid more, or more charitably, want to start a movement in which programmers that work on source-available software as a broader class get paid more. The other trait they have in common is a view that the open source definition and the four freedoms of free software do not sufficiently provide for this goal.

I agree with Drew on this, as I seem to on a lot of issues.  I even wrote something about it in my [*Free Culture License Wish List*]({% post_url 2020-03-29-copyleft %}), early in the life of the blog.  It seems especially laughable to need to deal with this debate, when we already largely had it thirty years ago, forcing a transition from "Free Software" to "Open Source Software" to make the corporate types more confident that nobody will sue them for scamming people into providing free labor.

I honestly wanted to copy the entire post, but that seemed inappropriate.  I did edit the quote *slightly*, though, largely capitalization.
