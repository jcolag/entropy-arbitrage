On the [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar), today---or rather, 20 Brumaire, so the fiftieth day of the year, with all thirty-day months---celebrated the [Festival of Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Reason#Festival_of_Reason), part of an attempt to provide an alternative state-sponsored secular religion, wanting to keep "the good parts" of Christianity---the moral teachings, the ritual, and so forth---without the hierarchical structures and anti-democratic authorities.

Off to the week's projects.

## Notoboto

{% codeberg jcolag/Notoboto %}

The program can now mark a note as deleted, so that it doesn't show up in the main interface.  The menu option sets the note's `isTrashed` property to `true`, with the code already ignoring those notes when populating the categories.

It also, because I have found the widget mostly unusable on the newer computer, gets the display's scale to make the text readable in the "tree view" for the document map.

```Tcl
set ppi [winfo fpixels . 1i]
set scaling [expr {$ppi / 72.0}]
```

That gives a fraction to multiply the font size, so that the document map doesn't get scrunched up.

## Cohost

{% codeberg jcolag/cohost %}

Continuing last week's trend of moving archived sites to Codeberg, you can now find the archive of [my Cohost posts](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/cohost/)[^ytZ-eM] on Codeberg.

[^ytZ-eM]:  Nope, I did not and will continue to not refer to them as "chosts."  I accepted *tweet* for Twitter posts, and find *toot* funnier for Mastodon now that they've tried to distance themselves from it, but I go no further than that...

## Salavi

{% codeberg jcolag/salavi %}

OK, this one needs explanation, even though I didn't finish it...

Way back when, I believe that somebody on Quora asked some crackpot question about how reincarnation could work if some vengeful force held them back.  I made a snide comment about that worry forming the basis of the popular game [Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders) and [Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman).

Think about it later, that started to sound like a fun idea.  Well, maybe it wouldn't feel fun to actually *play*, since the original game doesn't have an actual *game* to it, only random results.  But it could provide entertainment if not engagement.  I swapped Batman---one of the strongest, best-defended trademarks out there---for [The Owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_%28Dell_Comics%29), a similar character from Dell Comics during World War II, and safely in the public domain, and got to work.

I implemented a generator that produces a random Snakes and Ladders board, which has enough JavaScript in it to animate the "snakes"---using [Leader Line](https://anseki.github.io/leader-line/)---and has the player drag the playing piece to the destination square.  It plays, but I mostly moved on from it at that point.

After I moved it to Codeberg, though, I cleaned up the general page, added a (mostly) clean image of the Owl, and added a dark mode for the generated page.  It has a way to go before I'd call it worth announcing, but the frame mostly exists.

## Post News

{% codeberg jcolag/post.news %}

Like the Cohost archive, this repository has my [archive of Post.News posts](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/post.news/), another short-lived social media site.  Unlike Cohost's insistence on keeping everybody safe and not outgrowing their means, it seems worth reminding everybody that Post shut down because the founder believed this.

> A consumer business, at its core, needs to show rapid consumer adoption...

In other words, didn't see evidence that it would make them billionaires, so they pulled the plug.  I copied my [response to that official announcement]({% post_url 2024-04-22-earth %}) in one of these developer diary posts.

## Pebble

{% codeberg jcolag/pebble %}

And one more archived social media site, you can also check out my [archive of Pebble posts](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/pebble/).  Pebble started its brief life as "T2," an attempt by fleeing Twitter employees at creating a direct replacement for Twitter.

As I recall, after they shut down, they reused the name for a Mastodon instance, which they probably should've done in the first place.  Although checking things out, it looks like they stopped paying the bills on their server, so maybe not...

## Iungimoji Archive

{% codeberg jcolag/iungimoji-archive %}

Before I got the [Iungimoji](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/iungimoji/) memory game working as a complete standalone app, I spent about six months generating a daily game as a static HTML file with JavaScript.  To get them off my server, I uploaded the archive to GitHub, and now you can also find the [archived daily games](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/iungimoji-archive/) on Codeberg, too.

## GLOBE Archive

{% codeberg jcolag/globe-archive %}

Like Iungimoji, [G.L.O.B.E.](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/g-l-o-b-e/) started its evolution as a generator that created a daily game, before becoming a single page that generated its own game based on the day.  When I overhauled it, that left a similar [six months of archived daily games](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/globe-archive/), now also on Codeberg.

## Markov

{% codeberg jcolag/Markov %}

Another minor project moving over to Codeberg, this runs a Markov process, creating random content based on prior probability distributions.

I wrote this instead of grabbing a common implementation, though, for two reasons.  First, it can update its probability database alongside generation, which I needed for a certain application.  And it also operates on any kind of data, so it can work letter-by-letter to create nonsense text that still looks natural, word-by-word to create meaningless text that looks correct, or more complicated forms.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [Bicker](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker) and [Renew DB](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB).

## Next

I might have some other things brewing, but now that it has drifted back into my attention, I think that I have enough ideas to finish out the "game play," so that the Owl can interfere with the player's progress.  And then, maybe I'll see if I can quickly overhaul the architecture so that---like most of the other games---it doesn't require a separate board generator.
