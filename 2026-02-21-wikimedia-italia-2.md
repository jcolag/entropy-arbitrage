This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **Banana**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Banana**, Theatre projects funded by Wikimedia Italia
 * Location:  <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Theatre_projects_funded_by_Wikimedia_Italia>
 * Released:  2021
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Tomasi Leonardo
 * Medium:  Plays
 * Length:  Approximately 
 * Content Advisories:  Cartoon violence, reference to the work of several disgraced people

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Banana

The page for the project's collection only really says this:

> Theatre projects funded by Wikimedia Italia.

However, one of the documents provides a [full overview of the event](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bando_WMI_wiki_teatro_libero_2020.pdf), including this premise.

> Il presente bando "Wiki teatro libero" è emesso da Wikimedia Italia – Associazione per la diffusione della conoscenza libera (WMI) ( www.wikimedia.it ) nell'ambito delle sue attività per la diffusione, miglioramento e avanzamento del sapere, della cultura e delle possibilità di accesso alla conoscenza.
>
> E' condotto in collaborazione con Italian Linux Society.

Or, in English, that reads as follows.

> "Wiki Free Theatre" is issued by Wikimedia Italia – Association for the dissemination of free knowledge (WMI) (www.wikimedia.it) within its activities for the dissemination, improvement and advancement of knowledge, culture and the possibility of access to knowledge.
>
> It is conducted in collaboration with the Italian Linux Society.

Looking at the titles, you can get a sense of the general shape of the project, though.  Three of them cite [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) in the title.  Another refers to [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning).  Others refer to "free knowledge" or women in mathematics---specifically [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether)---and so forth.

This time through, we have the second play that doesn't heavily feature real people, **Banana**.  The other plays all seem to want to focus on those celebrity types, sometimes building the play from parts of their writing.  It doesn't include any dialogue, but if you want a feel for the intended presentation of this play, they recorded a mock-trailer that gives an impression of the style.

As you can guess, despite (or because of) my family name, I can't read much more Italian than guesswork from English root words and occasional similarity to French, so I'll read these in (machine) translation.  We all, I hope (especially by now) understand how that means that I might miss critical nuance or clever lines.

## What Works Well?

The play has some clever ideas.  For one example from early on, it talks about wanting to do something with stealing ideas, but not having an original spin on it, until they realized that they stole the idea of stealing ideas.  It also has a couple of nice metaphors for ideas and collaboration, and so forth.

And while I'll complain that the rapid-fire ideas feel like they work against the goals of the project, I do have to admit that it often has an interesting rhythm to it.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

You might disagree, but I feel like the play tries to do far too much.  It wants to talk about the evolution of culture over time through everybody's contributions, but *also* wants to (as mentioned) say something about the nature of ideas and creativity.  But it also wants to get into societies intolerant of new ideas, and also generation conflicts.  And it also wants to mention and try to connect *every* reference to primates or bananas.  Oh, and it also wants to rail against copyright, including United States copyright.  As a result, it doesn't really do any of those things well, as it jumps around from topic to topic.

The Presenter character also seems entirely unnecessary.  Part of the lack of focus at least feels like it comes from dropping the main story for the character's stream-of-consciousness rambling.  Integrating the useful parts into the conversations would probably improve this significantly.

## Opportunities

In one sense, I doubt the possibility, since the event ended five years ago, and we only have PDF files and some preview footage.

However, this coming out of Wikimedia, it "only" takes consensus-building (and maybe money) to get other parts of the organization to replicate the project.

## What's Adaptable?

The Monkey Academy and its Tree of Knowledge seem like the biggest piece, even if we do find it in an unlikely place, the Pennsylvania Zoo.  We also get a mention of film streaming service "high definition dot com."

## Coming Attractions

As mentioned, I don't think that we can squeeze much more out of the Wiki Free Theater project, with most-to-all the other plays serving more as introductions to people popular in wiki-style spaces.  As such, next time, we'll listen to **Mundo Virtual**, maybe with other work by the same artist.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the play?
