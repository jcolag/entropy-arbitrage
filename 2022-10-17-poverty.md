Today, people around the world celebrate the (deep breath...) [International Day for the Eradication of Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Eradication_of_Poverty), honoring the victims of the effects of poverty, such as hunger and violence.  As Joseph Wresinski indicated at the first celebration...

 > Wherever men and women are condemned to live in extreme poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty.

And I don't think that I have much chance of saying it better, even in a later age when we have empirical data showing that the cheapest and easiest way of raising people out of poverty involves...giving them money.

While I can't solve that problem directly, I *do* have an upcoming project that I hope will give all of us a chance to start impacting such large problems, together.

## G.L.O.B.E.

{% github jcolag/g-l-o-b-e %}

In addition to language and date, you can now choose to play **G.L.O.B.E.** using distance units *other* than miles.

In addition to miles and boring old kilometers, you can choose from Earth radii, [furlongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong), [nautical leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_%28unit%29), and [nautical miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile) to describe how far your character has traveled between countries and in total.

Presumably, I don't *need* to say this, but if anybody wants to see additional units, file an issue with enough information for me to the work---the name, symbol, and distance measured---or a pull request that adds the item to the list.

## Ham Newsletter

{% github jcolag/ham-newsletter %}

While I forgot to commit the change, October started with "another month, another element of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-newsletter-september-2022) didn't quite work."  In this case, the list of the month's most popular posts didn't have valid URLs associated with them.

After some haphazard debugging, I learned that the problem arose from my misinterpreting the data structure...that I think I created for this purpose.  Maybe some copy-and-paste error got in the way.  It doesn't matter.  I fixed the reference to the URL, so that `matomo-popular.js` will now assemble a Markdown paragraph linking to the top few posts as reported by [Matomo Analytics](https://matomo.org/).

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

As I have found myself updating and modifying my proofreading script---I should probably put together a post on which tools have helped me and which tools only made my life worse, because I have a list---I realized that the script can't risk over-writing information that a prior tool created.

If that seems like the excessively long way around saying something like "I changed the first invocation of a tool to append to the JSON output instead of writing the output"---an `>>` operator in place of an `>` operator, to give an idea of how small the *actual change* looks in comparison to this discussion---I agree.  But without all that verbiage, the change doesn't have enough context to make sense.

## CPREP

{% github jcolag/background-generator %}

I haven't gotten far, but I have finally started the process of updating **CPREP** to work without a server generating each page.

That process starts in the most tedious way possible:  Saving an example file, and going through it to replace each bit of text that changes from character to character with a `span` element, allowing me to assign each bit of text an identifier.  In theory, the JavaScript will go through the page and replace it with new data.

I say "in theory," there, not because I distrust the technology---I've certainly had to do this work enough times to know that I can trust it---but because I haven't done it yet, here, and upcoming work goes in the *next* section.  Plus, I can't guarantee that I won't fall asleep every time I go back to this tedious task, and so never get to the JavaScript part...

## Next

I've committed to **CPREP**, so expect a lot of work, there.  In addition to the "theoretical" JavaScript work described in the previous section, I may also need to remove the headshot for the duration.  But since that code never generated anything that actually looks like a person, I doubt that anybody'll strenuously object.
