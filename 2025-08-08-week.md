As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

As a reminder, the [Thirteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."  We put the practice behind closed doors, in other words, the reason that the [Black Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_%28United_States%29) arose and spread through many of our laws.

If you have ever nodded along with the idea that slavery built the United States, but don't care what happens to prisoners, maybe rethink that.

This step infuriates me, because even in these posts over the years, we have seen study after study, experiment after experiment, showing that you solve problems like housing, hunger, poverty, and illness by giving people homes, food, money, and health care.  Criminalizing behaviors required by the situation only makes matters worse, which the Trump administration absolutely wants to do.

In [last week's post]({% post_url 2025-08-01-week %}#901--tue-29-july-2025), I dedicated around five hundred words giving you the soft-sell on donating to your local PBS affiliate based on how much I have enjoyed [Passport](https://www.pbs.org/explore/passport/).  This time, I'll take a more blunt approach.

Like I did, you *will* find programming that you enjoy more than you do on your other streaming services or actual television, unless you primarily watch sports.  Take a few hours among their free offerings to find a couple of those shows, to validate my theory.  Then, rather than donate to your local station like I did, go [pick a station in need](https://adoptastation.org/) and donate to them, instead.  At the moment, it looks like Tennessee's WLJT television station will need to run on half of its normal budget, for example, as opposed to my nearby suburban television-and-radio station (WLIW) that will undoubtedly soldier on with ninety percent of its normal revenue.

Because someone will complain about paying for yet another service---and like I said last week, *technically* you donate to them, and they gift you access, because they can't sell things---a quick search turns up that the cheap plan at Netflix costs eighteen bucks per month, Hulu ten, Amazon Prime fifteen, Apple TV+ ten, (HBO)(Max) ten, Disney+ ten, Paramount+ eight, and Peacock eight...plus ESPN+ twelve, but as established, you won't catch many sports on PBS.  By comparison, most PBS stations will ask for five dollars per month for access to Passport.  Nuke your premium Netflix or whatever, and treat yourself to five months of more interesting programming.

If you'd rather support radio shows, you'll find a couple of stations struggling to get by with as little as a projected **one percent** of their normal budgets.  I admittedly don't understand the NPR donation levels and reward structure, because I have less interest in their work, but whatever you donate to a station in that much peril will almost certainly go somewhere useful.  A lot of the endangered public radio stations especially sit in news deserts, remember, meaning that in the event of a disaster, dollars to their only source of local news can often translate directly to getting people out of harm's way.

If you've read here for any length of time, then you probably know my opinions on this general topic.  For those of you who don't, howdy.  My own work doesn't contain much that we have come to label "adult," and I also don't engage with a lot of it.  However, I have always known those communities as the core of every community.  Force them out of almost any space, and the space stagnates if you get lucky, but more likely collapses.

In addition, they almost always act like good people, so I have never found a downside to backing them where possible.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/maya-temple-yucatan-mexico_1600.jpg|Mayan Temple pyramid of Kukulkan - Chichen Itza, Yucat√°n, Mexico|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Ancient Maya population was bigger than scientists thought](https://www.futurity.org/ancient-maya-population-3288822/) from Futurity

 > Using advanced analytical methods and reprocessed lidar data, researchers estimate that between 9.5 million and 16 million people inhabited the region during the Late Classic period (600‚Äì900 CE), across a 95,000-square-kilometer (around 36,680 square miles) area encompassing the rainforest lowlands.

They don't mention this, but I feel like I should probably point out that downplaying the size of the indigenous population feels like Colonization 101.  Especially centuries later, it makes it far more expedient to not care about what happened, if ethnic cleansing and slavery "only" affected small groups.

 > Veganism has led to a dedicated industry catering to that diet. Some restaurants feature vegan entr√©es. Some manufacturers specialize in vegan foods. Could it be the case that some companies will try to use the absence of AI as a selling point for their products and services?

A lot of this article feels like the author would rather find ways of overcoming that "hesitation," but it does make some good points about the analogy.
