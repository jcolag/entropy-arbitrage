As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > By the early 1980s, several technological advances had made the study of LTP more tractable. Using slices of hippocampus that could be kept alive outside the brain, for example, researchers could use drugs to block or activate different proteins populating the synapse, to find out how this affected LTP.

Interesting stuff, if not the most pressing issue.

If you'll pardon the personal anecdote, I probably mostly failed at dealing with this when I taught.  I didn't have many students drop or fail my classes, *but* I mostly presented information as I saw it, and that probably burdened students unnecessarily.  Oddly, though, I got the sense that traditionally disadvantaged groups took to my style better, on balance.

 > The Peopleâ€™s Union USA, who initially called the Feb. 28 action, has a litany of follow-up boycott days with different targets. But its lack of organizing people into any structure or any clear demands means the tactic will inevitably fail â€” and successive failures will lead people to the wrong conclusion that the tactic canâ€™t work.

While the scope of participation impresses me, I actually see a different flaw:  Nobody seems to want to use COVID-19 as a template.  In early 2020, we stopped eating out and shopping, even reducing online shopping to a minimum, and within a couple of weeks, the United States government---Trump and a Republican Congress in both chambers with a larger majority than they have today---started sending us money, because that had them in a complete panic.

That, and the constant downward reductions in the CDC's recommended quarantine duration gives a *fairly* good idea of how long it would take to get them to cave to pretty much any demand.

 > The House Republican budget blueprint calls for stealing, over nine years, $880 billion out of Medicaid to help pay for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for the richest people in the country. That will pay for a lot of champagne aboard million-dollar yachts, but at the expense of my familyâ€™s health.

I might have cut the title before the second *need*.  We need Medicaid.  We don't need billionaires.

I feel like I say this with alarming frequency, but one of our criminal justice system's biggest problems is that we don't have any agreed-upon goals for it.  Because we can't say that we care about reducing crime or helping victims or anything else, we end up with these obscene situations where we put people in prison for years so that they can choose (with insufficient information) a method for the state to kill them, so that...nobody knows why, I don't think.

Executions don't *punish* the victim, because they presumably stopped caring.  An execution doesn't restore anything.  It hasn't deterred crime...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [An update on (Firefox's) Terms of Use](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/update-on-terms-of-use/) from Distilled

 > Our intent was just to be as clear as possible about how we make Firefox work, but in doing so we also created some confusion and concern. With that in mind, weâ€™re updating the language to more clearly reflect the limited scope of how Mozilla interacts with user data.

Two things.

First, **ha**.  Yeah, it *never* occurred to them that "a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate" would cause people to interpret that as turning to data mining, after people had exactly the same reaction to corporate social media when those companies rolled out similar policies.

Second, at least we can still shame them into doing the right thing.

They have a *lot* of worthwhile articles, there, if you have the time.
