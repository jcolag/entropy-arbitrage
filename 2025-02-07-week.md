As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > One key job we ask our federal employees to do is root out private sector fraud in federal contracting. We should hire more of these people! Private contractors steal $274b/year from the public purse â€“ nearly enough to pay for all the employees in the federal government.

While I mostly fall on the side of sovereign countries having no "debt," because they literally create every dollar (or relevant national currency) and spend it into the economy, depriving worthless people of money never hurts...

 > The fact that there can be invaluable work going on in each of the five segments highlights the idea that there is no single correct approach to creating change. Rather, the fortunes of social movements depend on the dynamic relationships that exist within the ecosystem of groups pursuing political transformation.

Hashtags:  #Organizing

Much as I hate the insipid "Trump 2.0" nonsense---actually, stop applying version numbers to random things in general---it'll absolutely take a lot of work, and many different kinds of work, to limit the damage that this administration does, and clean up when we force them out.

 > But consider this: a middle-class family loses their rented home in the fires, along with all their belongings, and the community rallies to support them. But if those same people were unable to pay rent because of an unexpected financial emergency months earlier, would their community spring up in the same manner?

Hashtags:  #Organizing

While this makes useful points, I don't agree entirely, because this makes the right-wing case for them, that communities should help each other, rather than "the government"---apparently not the community working together, somehow---helping anybody.  This sort of collective action also quickly falls victim to various kinds of prejudice, where well-liked individuals magically receive more help, whereas we can institute laws and guidelines to force a government to act fairly.

 > [I] can't actually imagine a time in which the need for more diversity would ever cease. Affirmative action has been an issue since segregation practices. The question is not when does it end, but when does it begin...When do people of color truly get the benefits to which they are entitled?

 > Both studies noted larger increases in deaths among infants born with birth defects. This suggests women are delivering more babies with severe congenital malformations who have no hope of survival beyond a few hours, days or, at most, a few weeks.

Hashtags:  #Abortion

I know that it'll come as a complete surprise that the alleged "pro-life" activists promote policies that kill more people.  Nobody would've expected it, I know, what with how they also refuse to alleviate poverty but will pay bounties to abortion-hunters...

 > Much academic focus on this situation has been directed at the role of zoning and regulations play in the housing shortage. Howard and his colleagues, however, turned their sights on the impact of deportations on an industry that relies on undocumented workers.

Again, I know that it seems completely unbelievable that right-wing policies do almost the opposite of what they claim, and therefore inflict pain for no other reason than to prevent people from living their lives in public...but yeah, they pretty much do that for everything, so get used to it.

 > To you, of the younger generation, what a marvel, what a world of meaning in those words --- "I have been taught patience." We, who fret and chafe because the whole world will not bend its will to our puny strivings, and turn its whole course that we might have our unripe desires fulfilled, should read and re-read of the man who could wait, because he knew that time and all eternity would be bent to meet his desires in time.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Trump Admin Deletes Video Explaining Grammatical Concept of Pronouns in War Against DEI](https://www.404media.co/trump-admin-deletes-video-explaining-grammatical-concept-of-pronouns-in-war-against-dei/) from 404 Media

 > Similarly, [the National Institutes of Health](https://web.archive.org/web/20250112055807/https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro) deleted a page about the Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office, which has done critical research about the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people.

To avoid any jargon-like "pronouns," let's make this plain by also not abbreviating anything:  The Trump administration, following the dictates in Project 2025 and their billionaire overlords, wants to erase any traces of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

See, journalists?  If you report it that way, you don't play into their narratives and look complicit.  They believe that you can never find a better candidate for a job than a white man, and fear any process that exposes the many flaws in that reasoning.

 > Unsurprisingly, those purchases reflect what we're eating: Americans at all income levels [have diets that don't satisfy](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.3422) federal dietary guidelines. Spotlighting the poor food choices of SNAP participants would be a distraction from these facts and would [risk further stigmatizing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117367) a successful [anti-hunger program](https://theconversation.com/how-stigma-anxiety-and-other-psychological-factors-can-contribute-to-food-insecurity-160681).

There also definitely comes a point where, if you want to restrict the options so much, you might as well give people the food that you approve of, and save everybody the paperwork.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [These Nigerian women are claiming their "right to own land"](https://minorityafrica.org/these-nigerian-women-are-claiming-their-right-to-own-land/) from Minority Africa

 > Cedric Owuru, the Linking, Learning, and Amplifier Officer at Voice Global, explains that the organization, a grant facility implemented by Oxfam and other partners in West Africa, provides capacity building and grants to marginalized groups. This support enables these groups to demand civic participation, political participation, access to resources, social services, and employment opportunities.

I found the story interesting, at least...
