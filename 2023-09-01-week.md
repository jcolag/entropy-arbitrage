As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The interaction of human psychology and algorithm amplification leads to dysfunction because social learning supports cooperation and problem-solving, but social media algorithms are designed to increase engagement.

I assume that most of us probably figured this out already---I certainly talk about it enough---but as always, I have no objection to having quantitative data to back it.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/110968080027752018)

 > Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of. There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately, there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.

 > What is troubling is that, while the predictions of journalists, pollsters, and analysts can be wrong, it was the marginalizing tone and the refusal to take critical analyses that presented credible alternative scenarios to the public into account.

Honestly, I don't know if I buy this.  It sounds like the same scrambling after Trump's 2016 election here, trying to deflect blame from the *many* people who insisted that everybody should support those (like themselves) who planned to vote third-party or not vote at all.  After the election, they all came back out of the woodwork assuring us that they definitely voted the right way, and needed to place the blame on "party messaging" failing to get some ill-defined *other* group of voters from the polls, completely unrelated to their campaign to disrupt the election.

That said, I also haven't seen much information coming out of T√ºrkiye since the election.

I don't really think that I can add anything to the quote, let alone the whole article.

Since people began taking remote work seriously, I've noticed "job requirements" that seem to only exist to discriminate, like requiring the ability to lift ten pounds or the like.  I don't know how a company gets away with that, let alone so many.

I hope that this case puts an end to the constant stream of whiners online wondering why Creative Commons or the Free Software Foundation (et al.) hasn't written yet another license---incompatible with all other licenses, I guess---that refuses permission for training neural networks.  The fact that this idea would fail to distinguish between a multinational corporation and a student, or that not providing attribution *already* puts these companies in violation of the license, seems entirely lost on them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > In accordance with previous findings, for example, conservative-led nonprofits were more likely to reference words linked to the foundation of sanctity, while liberal-led organizations more frequently alluded to fairness.

I don't find this particularly important, but as more people need to get involved with messaging, we should understand how people read and associate those messages.
