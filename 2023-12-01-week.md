As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I have to admit to a small amount of eye-rolling at articles like this, because as interesting as I find them, the framing that we created the national parks at the expense of the native populations feels slightly disingenuous, considering that *the entire country* exists at their expense.

Many years ago, people invited me for some holiday dinner or other, and the political rhetoric at the time led many to worry that the Supreme Court would take *that* opportunity to overturn *Roe v Wade*.  My host, a nurse, talked about this angrily, declaring that if it came down to it, they would perform abortions themselves at that dining room table.

I quipped that, in that case, we might not come back the following year.

While I have no idea if the comment landed the way that I wanted it to---referencing the idea of eating where medical procedures have taken place---it introduced me to the idea that a government really can't reasonably ban abortion anymore.  I mean, sure, they can put a law on the books, but we've progressed far beyond the [dilation and curettage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_and_curettage) technique common prior to *Roe*, to the point that, if the need arose, we could quickly have people **everywhere** trained to conduct [medical abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion) or [menstrual extractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_extraction) as necessary, with referral networks so distributed and complex that authorities would only ever know if someone confessed.

I wish that I could have the same sort of optimism about voting rights as I do about abortion.  However, committing voter fraud doesn't work nearly as well as underground abortion network, as evidenced by how many Republicans we catch trying to sneak a few votes through.  Instead, we need to constantly fight the elements in government that would rather silence certain populations, from town officials up to the Supreme Court.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

You'll find some interesting music in there, unsurprisingly.
