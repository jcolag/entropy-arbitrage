* Ignore for ToC

As most of you probably know, we had a little election in the United States, this past week.  You know, one of those low-stakes things where we could choose somebody continuing the most progressive policies that this country has seen since the Carter administration and somebody planning to implement all of [Project 2025](https://stopproject2025comic.org/), from the discrimination to the machine politics to the economic pillaging.  And the country definitely made a choice.

It angers me that too few people in the country saw this as worth getting right.  It scares me that I now need to take time out from literally everything else, because I now need to *also* check in on people, to make sure that nothing new has happened to them by an emboldened mob.  And it absolutely infuriates me to see that finger-pointing at literally everybody but the fascists has begun, because apparently we don't mind them.

And yet, I do have some thoughts that I want to get out.

## To My Fellow White Men

Based on the numbers, I need to address you (incoming sarcasm) geniuses first.  You guys, get over yourselves.

Seriously, think long and hard about how much you value thinking of yourself having something long and hard that you either voted against or couldn't trouble yourself to vote for a woman.  If you find your masculinity so threatened by a Harris administration, then I sincerely hope that you get everything that you deserve out of your new allegience with fascists.

You wonder why people lump us together as worthless?  They do it because, as a group, we keep pulling garbage stunts like this and expecting everybody to praise us for not actively participating in mass murder.

I don't care what you have as an excuse.  Did you make a "principled decision," under the assumption that the rest of the country would protect you from your carelessness?  Do you hope that your boss will keep you employed because you voted for cutting his taxes?  Or did you decide that you'd rather watch TV?  It doesn't matter.  What matters is that the country will hold you responsible for every death caused by this administration.

 * Every suicide by a transgender kid who can't get help.
 * Every suicide by a member of the armed forces.
 * Every pregnant person who a doctor refuses medical treatment due to fears of prosecution over abortion.
 * Every unwanted child born into a family that can't support them.
 * Every refugee thrown into an open-air detention camp in the desert.
 * Every refugee murdered, when the administration realizes that it'd cost less to shoot them than feed them.
 * Every non-white person killed at a traffic stop because the cop felt uneasy.
 * Every journalist killed by someone who took it upon themselves to "protect" the administration from facts.
 * Every lynching caused by bigots who assume that nobody will prosecute them.
 * Every child from a low-income family who the state "allows" to work twenty-hour days for sub-minimum wage instead of going to school.
 * Everybody who'll starve or freeze from skyrocketing prices.
 * Everybody killed by an authoritarian regime that the government supports[^1].

[^1]:  Yes, I know that *some* of those people would've died under the Harris administration.  Expect it to get worse under Trump, not better.  Expect fewer media outlets to cover the results, not more.  And expect people to have too much to do worrying about everybody else on the list than people halfway around the world.  Authoritarians tricked you into thinking that making things worse will wake people up, because they wanted to make things worse.

I've probably forgotten some categories, but you now get to wear those deaths for your decision.  If you believe in an afterlife, good luck to you, because I don't see that application process going at all well.

## Hope

Despite the awful state of affairs, and how much worse we can expect them to get, I do want to make the point that this country has been through worse.

When our ancestors started colonizing this continent, almost everybody in the world---except for a few local tribes, maybe ironically---saw themselves as subjects of an all-powerful ruler imbued with divine authority.  But when a couple-dozen coffee-guzzling writers said that maybe we should each have a say in how governments governed us, it only took a few decades for [dozens of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions) to oust their kings, a trend that has continued to today, when (as I've written before) you only have three kinds of governments:  Democracies, authoritarian propped up by oil money, and irrelevant on the world stage except when they pretend to have nuclear weapons coming soon.

The United States clung to *chattel slavery* while everybody else in the world abandoned anything that resembled any kind of slavery, and we needed to fight a war to stop it.  But we did stop it.

Women couldn't vote until 1920.  Black people faced slavery-descended discrimination until 1964.  Women often needed to commit perjury to get a divorce until the 1970s, and had to wait about the same length of time to get their own bank accounts.
