(Some of you following via RSS may have snagged a "sneak peek" of this post on Friday, because I didn't set the right date on the post while drafting it.  Serves me right for trying to get something out quickly.  This version of the post doesn't cut off at the start.)

As most of you probably know, we had a little election in the United States, this past week.  You know, one of those low-stakes things where we could choose somebody continuing the most progressive policies that this country has seen since the Carter administration and somebody planning to implement all of [Project 2025](https://stopproject2025comic.org/), from the discrimination to the machine politics to the economic pillaging.  And the country definitely made a choice.

![A Black Lives Matter protest, including someone holding up a sign with a raised fist, and another sign asserting that we can't stay silent about things that actually matter](/blog/assets/50115137476_a23d59e537_o.png "I actually picked this for the raised-fist sign, but the other sign also has a valid point.")

It angers me that too few people in the country saw this as worth getting right.  It scares me that I now need to take time out from literally everything else, because I now need to *also* check in on people, to make sure that nothing new has happened to them by emboldened bigots.  And it absolutely infuriates me to see that finger-pointing at literally everybody but the fascists has begun, because apparently we don't mind them as much.

And yet, I do have some thoughts that I want to get out.  As a result of those emotions, though, this may feel less like a cohesive blog post and more like a series of short posts that don't quite connect, and I apologize for that.  Likewise, I apologize for some rushed proofreading that might have missed some connections or better structure...

## To My Fellow White Men

Based on the numbers, I need to address you (incoming sarcasm) geniuses first.  You guys, get over yourselves.

Seriously, think long and hard about how much you value thinking of yourself having something long and hard that you either voted against or couldn't trouble yourself to vote for a woman, how utterly impotent you look making the worst decision to feel like you have some control.  If you find your masculinity so threatened by a Harris administration, then I sincerely hope that you get everything that you deserve out of your new allegiance with fascists, because they'll gleefully emasculate you more than anybody else, now that you've shown yourself as this weak.

Do you wonder why people lump us together as worthless?  They do it because, as a group, we keep pulling garbage stunts like this and expecting everybody to praise us for not actively participating in mass murder.

I don't care what you have as an excuse.  Did you make a "principled decision," under the infantile assumption that the rest of the country would protect you from your desire to not feel complicit in something?  Do you hope that your boss will keep you employed because you voted for cutting his taxes?  Or did you decide that you'd rather watch TV?  It doesn't matter.  It only matters that everyone will hold you responsible for every death caused by this administration.

 * Every suicide by a transgender kid who can't get help or medical care.
 * Every suicide by a member of the armed forces.
 * Every pregnant person who a doctor refuses medical treatment due to fears of prosecution over abortion.
 * Every unwanted child born into a family that can't support them.
 * Every refugee thrown into an open-air detention camp in the desert.
 * Every refugee murdered, when the administration realizes that it'd cost less to shoot them than feed them.
 * Every American who law enforcement decides to treat as a refugee to throw them into the detention camps.
 * Every non-white person killed at a traffic stop because the cop felt uneasy around them.
 * Every journalist killed by someone who took it upon themselves to "protect" the administration from facts.
 * Every lynching caused by bigots who assume that nobody will prosecute them.
 * Every child from a low-income family who the state "allows" to work twenty-hour days for sub-minimum wage instead of going to school.
 * Everybody who'll starve or freeze from skyrocketing prices.
 * Every diabetic who can't afford insulin when the administration retracts the price cap.
 * Everybody killed by an authoritarian regime that the government supports[^1].
 * Everybody killed by the next disease outbreak because RFK Jr. doesn't like vaccines.
 * Every pregnant person overseas who dies after the government institutes the [Hyde Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) amendment.
 * Everybody killed by a mass shooter, or who gets caught in the literal crossfire between "good guys with guns."

[^1]:  Yes, I know that *some* of those people would've died under the Harris administration.  Expect it to get worse under Trump, not better.  Expect fewer media outlets to cover the results, not more.  And expect people to have too much to do worrying about everybody else on the list than people halfway around the world.  Authoritarians tricked you into thinking that making things worse will wake people up, because they wanted to make things worse, much like they tricked voters into avoiding Hubert Humphrey to elect Richard Nixon to magically end the Vietnam War.

I've probably forgotten some categories, but you now get to wear those deaths around your shoulders for your decision.  If you believe in an afterlife, good luck to you, because I definitely don't see that application process going at all well.  And let's not even worry about---as with the women and Latine voters for Trump---when the administration decides to turn against whatever group you find yourself in, because surely they'll consider you "one of the good ones."  (Spoiler:  They won't.  Prepare to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life, too.)

## Hope

Despite the awful state of affairs, and how much worse we can expect them to get, I do want to make the point that this country has gone through worse.

When our ancestors started colonizing this continent, almost everybody in the world---except for a few local tribes, ironically, maybe---saw themselves as subjects of an all-powerful ruler imbued with divine authority.  But when a couple-dozen coffee-guzzling writers said that maybe we should each have a say in how governments governed us, it only took a few decades for [dozens of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions) to oust their kings, a trend that has continued to today, when (as I've written before) you only have three kinds of governments:  Democracies, authoritarian propped up by oil money, and irrelevant on the world stage except when they pretend to have nuclear weapons coming soon.

The United States clung to *chattel slavery* while everybody else in the world abandoned anything that resembled any kind of slavery, and we needed to fight a war to stop it.  But we did stop it.

Women couldn't vote until 1920.  Black people faced legalized, slavery-descended discrimination until 1964.  Women often needed to commit perjury to get a divorce until the 1970s, and had to wait about the same length of time to get their own bank accounts.  Gay people couldn't get married a decade ago.

We celebrate all the milestones of these changes and more when they have anniversaries, but I don't think that most of us really stop to think about what they *mean*.  And they mean that, whatever the second Trump administration has in store for us, the country will survive it and fix the problems, because we've dealt with worse.  It may unfortunately require an armed insurrection to get there, if they get themselves too entrenched, but also probably not.

Oh, and if the electoral map feels overwhelming and demoralizing, take a look at this one, from not too long ago.

![The 1984 electoral map, showing a near-sweep for Republicans](/blog/assets/ElectoralCollege1984.svg "ðŸ˜±")

Yeah.  In 1984, Ronald Reagan received almost two-thirds of the popular vote and almost ninety-eight percent of the electoral vote; Walter Mondale barely won his home state and Washington, DC.  The map doesn't look better on [the county level](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1984_United_States_presidential_election_results_map_by_county.svg), by the way, where we could dismiss a win like this as highly targeted campaigning.  Mondale and Ferraro would've probably done a fantastic job, but people voted for warmongering, tax cuts for the wealthy, and exclusion of non-whites and non-Christians, instead.

I mean to say that, if you have a short political memory, this feels like a devastating and maybe unrecoverable loss.  But we've fixed far worse problems, as a society, and---unlike current wins by Republicans---haven't ever required decades of systematic cheating (gerrymandering, voter suppression, disinformation, and more) to enable those repairs.

### Put the Hope (and Fear) to Work

You might want to read [A new wave of movements against Trumpism is coming](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/11/a-new-wave-of-movements-against-trumpism-is-coming/), because it talks about the fear that we felt at the end of 2016, and how we collectively channeled that fear---and hope for a better country---into limiting the damage of Trump's first administration.

Hope doesn't do anything on its own.  We need to envision that better country and world, but we also need to work to make that happen, to fight for it.

That fight might take a variety of forms, from donating to and volunteering with organizations with a good track record of stopping these sorts of initiatives, to---in extreme cases---maybe moving across the country with a few thousand of your closest friends to nudge the electoral map[^4].

[^4]:  While I don't actually recommend putting in that kind of effort, I *will* point out that less than two hundred thousand liberal-leaning voters moving to Wyoming would completely change an entire state's political landscape.  But normally, people think about this in terms of the level of the electoral district, flipping close races, when they think of extreme ideas like this at all.

This goes a long way to explaining so many authoritarian policies, by the way.  They'll cut education, health care, safety, consumer protection, and everything else that they can get their hands on, because if you feel hopeless, then you won't fight back.  Or worse, you'll lash out violently, so that they have a new excuse to restrict rights.

## Measured Hope

That mildly hopeful message delivered, I also want to point out that this only works in the aggregate.  As I mentioned in the condemnation of the people who didn't vote against Trump, a lot of people will get hurt and a lot of people will die, as this goes forward.  A lot of people have *already* gotten hurt and died.  I don't consider them sacrifices for some "greater good" or collateral damage.

On the contrary, I consider the harm to them a series of tragedies that we all need to fight to minimize.  But we'll inevitably lose people, because the administration's policies will deliberately cause that harm, and they have the means to do it.

As such, have hope for the long term, but expect to pay a heavy cost in this fight, and expect people with privilege (like myself) to look at the problem abstractly and insipidly tell you to accept it as the cost of future freedom.  We shouldn't have had to pay that cost, so that statement makes no sense, but expect to hear it anyway.  Even so, that doesn't make the fight any less important, because every success reduces that cost.

## Hope Defiantly

A couple of months ago, I wrote about the [use of the word "weird"]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %}) to describe authoritarians and their hangers-on.  As I mentioned then, it works, because---when used properly---weirdness doesn't convey a value judgment, only difference.  I consider myself weird.  I also consider JD Vance weird.

We differ enormously, though, in how much we can embrace that description.  When we call Vance weird, it bothers him, because it undermines his "every-man who only coincidentally gets an allowance from Peter Thiel" persona, and he needs that identity to keep attention off him.  When somebody calls the rest of us weird, though, we can laugh along with it, because yes, everyone has their unique and weird aspects.

It goes deeper than that, though, for our purposes today.

People such as Vance and Trump can't limit themselves to their self-obsession with normality.  No, they need everyone else to obsess about normality, too, so that they can police it.  Why?  Every non-conformist in the population reminds people that you don't need some creepy weirdo policing you, and can get along fine in life with a little weirdness.  And at this point, hope becomes a tool for resistance.

I can't and would never tell you to expose your identity for the sake of moving the country forward.  That could, as mentioned, put you at rather extreme risk.  But if you can safely do so, I would strongly recommend becoming more open about how you see yourself, because it lowers the risk for the next person.  And when all of us seem a little weird, the people who demand that you see them as normal stand out even more, and their subterfuge collapses.

In my professional life, to use myself as a quick example, I have had tendency to wear brightly colored dress shirts, particularly pink and similar tones.  While I happen to look fairly good in pinks and reds, I actually made that choice because of its current association with women and homosexuality, which posed a nice little challenge to the worst kinds of people.  They wouldn't dare to try to push me around, so they needed to tolerate somebody transgressing in a way that made them uncomfortable.  And it gave permission to others to dress more how they wanted, because I got away with it.  Likewise, I use terms like [book club](/blog/tag/book-club) and [diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal), because they have female-coded connotation.

In the same way---again, only if you can safely do so---we need your weirdness (I should probably say non-conformance, at this point) out there, so that it stops looking weird.  Especially if you have other kinds of privilege, as I do, putting our least-conformant selves on display spreads out the pressure, so that we all face less difficulty.

## Place Blame Properly

I said at the top that it infuriates me that we have people trying to cope with this loss by blaming exactly the wrong people.

Bernie Sanders, ignoring the work of regulatory agencies under Biden and his support of unions, declared that [Democrats abandoned the working class](https://theconversation.com/bernie-sanders-says-the-left-has-lost-the-working-class-has-it-forgotten-how-to-speak-to-them-243160), laundering right-wing talking points to score political points.  You don't need to go far to find media outlets *already* repeating their "liberals live in a bubble" rhetoric, because apparently they think that honesty isolates you from the real world, and have plans to platform even more right-wing extremists to fix the problem of right-wing extremism.

I see people condemning Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Merrick Garland, Jack Smith, Elena Kagan, and pretty much any high-profile Democrat for not taking authoritarian action to stop authoritarians[^2].  And I see so many people blaming Harris for not making their pet policy the centerpiece of her campaign.

[^2]:  I'll admit that I'd absolutely laugh for a long time, if lame-duck Biden took his Supreme Court-granted presidential immunity for a spin and had all the assorted insurrectionists captured by the military and sent to a [black site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site) in order to swear in Hakeem Jeffries as President as the next in succession.  But I also know how doing that would undermine faith in the country far faster than enduring whatever horrors a Trump administration might hold for us. You can't fix authoritarianism with slightly nicer authoritarianism.

Oh, and don't forget all those outlets diligently posting the map that "explains" how Trump won, showing that...more voters in more districts voted for him, as if we didn't understand how the election worked.

Do you know who I *don't* see blamed?

I don't see the bigoted demagogues on the list.  I don't see a corporate media shielding Trump from scrutiny on the list, including the big-name comedians who tried to make it fun.  And I don't see the seventy-odd million people who voted for Trump, and the many more millions of Americans who *chose not to vote* on the list.  And they actually caused the problem.

In particular, as Marci Wheeler points out in [her post last night <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://www.emptywheel.net/2024/11/10/two-elections-the-rules-were-that-you-guys-werent-going-to-fact-check/), the Trump/Vance campaign's propaganda "created the malaise that Trump promised he would solve," and that the Harris/Walz campaign pushed back the authoritarian vote in proportion to how hard they campaigned in those areas.

As such, instead of trying to figure out---in parallel to Trump and Vance doing the same thing---which Democrats to "punish" for your insecurity, consider that the [New York Times Tech Guild <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://nytimesguild.org/tech/guild-builds/index.html) may eventually end their strike, and maybe you *shouldn't* go back to reading the paper or playing their games when they do.  Or finally cut your Amazon Prime subscription or AWS back-end.  Or stop using {% x %}, for crying out loud, yes even indirectly by posting screenshots or through a third-party quoting service, because it now exclusively exists as a pro-authoritarian propaganda outlet.

## American As Apple Pie

Also, while we have blame on the mind, let's also stop deluding ourselves with the following attempts to push blame away.

 * Insistence that Republicans have copied the Nazis.
 * Claims that [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) controls Trump and/or Vance, especially that they get their misogyny and pro-natalism from him.
 * Worries about Elon Musk and Peter Thiel because of their South African origins.

Other claims exist, but I want to make the point that all of them try to suggest that this country's racism, sexism, and authoritarianism come from *outside* the country.  But go back to the first section on hope.  The United States found a way to make slavery worse.  The United States permitted discrimination and prevented women from having their own lives until only about fifty years ago.  Gay people couldn't get married in most of the country *ten* years ago.

Hell, as [Isabel Wilkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Wilkerson) discovered in her research, the Nazis used [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) as a template for the [Nuremberg Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws), not the other way around.

While I consider it hopeful that we overcame those bad ideas and so can do so again, let's also point out that our government takes its design cues from people who had an extremely narrow view of humanity, and set into motion a lot of the conflicts that we still have today.  The myth of [outside agitators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_agitator) has prevented and prevents us from dealing with the actual problem, the pervasive racism and sexism in American society.

We didn't get Trump because Putin and Musk secretly manipulated people into hating Black women.  Again, the numbers of people voting for Trump *decreased*.  Rather, many Americans---predominantly white, predominantly men---saw Project 2025 as an issue to weigh equally against the discomfort of seeing a non-white woman as President of the United States.

Consider this in an additional light:  In all of popular culture, how many American presidents bear any resemblance to Vice President Harris?  Plenty look like Biden, Trump, Vance, and other white men.  A handful look like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.  But I don't know that you'll find [any intersectional examples](https://theconversation.com/even-fictional-presidents-dont-look-like-kamala-harris-although-black-men-and-white-women-have-been-represented-in-the-oval-office-235821) without scrolling to the end of the linked article[^3].  And without those examples, how do we expect the public to get used to the idea?

[^3]:  If you come up with any, please share them.  Surely, some indie comic must have expanded the idea of what a president looks like by now, right?

I don't want to suggest that Harris lost because NBC didn't publicize [**State of Affairs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Affairs_%28TV_series%29) sufficiently ten years ago.  But I also don't want to under-sell the value of teaching people what kinds of world that we can have through fiction.

## Avoid Violence

I've mentioned violence a couple of times in this post, fairly dismissively, and I have two reasons for that.

First, as I've mentioned, especially when they can scapegoat people other than white men, the right-wing loves to spin any violence as evidence that they need to amplify their policies and enforce them with more violence.  We've all heard them rant about "Black on Black crime" myths---the numbers look a lot like white-on-white crime numbers, because most criminals only commit crimes of opportunity---as an excuse to continue over-policing Black neighborhoods.

Equally importantly, though, most of us won't kill somebody else, because that takes either an extraordinary amount of resolve *or* a lack of empathy for other humans.  Most countries have moved away from conscripted militaries, because normal people tend not to murder.  You can see this today in Europe, with Russia and Ukraine finding their conscripts close to useless in combat, to say nothing of the many people refusing to fight.

In other words, if you've thought about getting a gun "in case," it probably won't save you in an emergency, but it'll become the same kind of danger that they become in everybody else's household.  And for those of you with your hands raised to say that you'll use a knife instead...really think about how that idea actually sounds before trying to save your life by stabbing somebody to death.

Tempting as it feels, then, maybe try not to imagine that you'll kill your way to solving the country's problems.

## Stay Safe

Nobody knows how this will actually turn out, but I do know that we need to fight the current direction to protect our friends, neighbors, and colleagues.  Some of us will need to do that through sabotaging and delaying processes.  Others will need to donate and march.  A handful of us might need to---through encrypted channels only, please, and not with your existing friend network---organize places where people can stay if situations deteriorate in some states.  But I want to leave you with three last ideas.

First, take breaks, because everybody burning out helps nobody.  If you don't take care of yourself, then you won't have the capacity to take care of other people.

And I might also float one possible idea for individual action that, if widespread, can tip the scales quickly:  Minimize your purchases.  I hinted at this above, hinting about the connection between Jeff Bezos using his **Washington Post** to avoid endorsing Harris in order to curry favor with Trump and maybe canceling Amazon Prime in response.  But consider that, with corporate consolidation in almost every market, you have some similar connection.  And we can hurt those companies by not giving them money.

How might this translate to policy decisions?  Consider the first months of 2020, when the Trump administration tried to ignore COVID-19.  People---due to fear that has only proven correct, since---stayed home, neither working nor shopping.  In response, a Republican-led government, in the middle of trying to dismantle our minimal social safety net, sent people "stimulus checks."  Why?  Their supporters need us to spend money.  Not spending money on them sends a fairly clear message as those numbers increase.

Granted, I say this as somebody with fairly minimal expenses, but if you can darn some socks to put off buying new pairs, that might do proportionally more damage than a labor strike that takes far more coordination.

And finally, *please* stop thinking of these resistance movements as one-time gigs, that you do the work once and usher in utopia.  We will **always** have people waiting to take advantage of weaknesses in the system to implement their authoritarian agendas.  When we ultimately oust these people, don't assume (once again) that we've magically reached the End of History, and will never need to fight for human rights again, because we absolutely will.  Instead, work to make sure the cost of breaching those rights grows to the point that the authoritarians weaken themselves when they ultimately act.
