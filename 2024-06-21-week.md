As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

We need so much more of this, but it shows that we *can* have an economy that doesn't completely hollow out the country.

Honestly?  It actually surprises me that Republicans haven't jumped on this to *praise* his statement.  After all, they've spent decades spinning the story that "you can't tell the difference between parties," except that they (despite all evidence to the contrary) tell the truth about their base motivations.  In that light, you'd almost expect them to make not caring about Americans their slogan...

 > Nationally, about 2.5 million people aged 18 and older had an opioid abuse disorder in 2021 ‚Äî and nearly 300 people died of overdoses every single day. Yet only 36 percent of those experiencing addiction received any treatment at all.

Hashtags:  #Addiction #Health

This situation especially irks me, because I've seen so many studies over the years linking drug use to loneliness and boredom.  That simplifies the dynamic, for many reasons, but we could almost certainly reduce the number of people dealing with addiction over time through outreach alone.  But we have governments that won't pay for that, won't pay for drugs that reduce addiction, and won't fund programs that help people break addictions.

We absolutely need more of this.  Despite management's obsession with controlling employees, the pandemic made it absolutely clear that companies have thrown their money away maintaining lavish offices and workers get more done if they don't need to carve out a chunk of every day to commute.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The unusual case highlights that stalkers or other malicious third parties could piggyback off surveillance systems that are used by the police if not enough protections are in place to stop the distribution of such data.

Does anybody want to bet that precincts do this in hopes of getting the public to turn against freedom-of-information laws...?

 > French President Emmanuel Macron arrived on May 23 to defuse tension in the Pacific territory, but his visit failed to quell the unrest as he merely suspended the enforcement of the bill instead of addressing the demand for a dialogue on how to proceed with the decolonization process. He also deployed an additional 3,000 troops to restore peace and order which only further enraged the local population.

This seems like a bad move *while* Macron also considers handing his government over to fascists, but I admittedly don't know anything about modern French colonial politics.
