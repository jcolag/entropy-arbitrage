To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Steamboat Sailor Brawl

The creator describes the comic as follows.

> To celebrate the arrival of the iconic Popeye the Sailor in the public domain, I wanted to draw a continuous, cartoony fight scene. It made sense to include my rough-and-tumble take on Steamboat Willie (aka Mickey Mouse). Thus, _**Steamboat Sailor Brawl!**_ emerged—a comic that explores transformative work using public domain cartoon characters.
>
> The project is simple: throughout 2025 I will attempt to draw as many comic panels as I can, sometimes daily, depicting a ridiculous brawl between these two cartoon icons. In the spirit of this being a comic utilizing public domain characters, you are welcome to remix and repurpose these cartoons, or join in the fun.

Also, this note.

> Much in the spirit of my other public domain endeavor, [The Shmoofy Experiment](https://hpkomics.com/the-shmoofy-experiment/), I want this project to represent open culture and transformative works. Both [Mickey Mouse](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/) and [Popeye](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/happy-public-domain-day-popeye-rhapsody-in-blue-the-sound-and-the-fury-and-thousands-of-other-captivating-creations-are-finally-free-for-everyone-to-use-180985744/) can be used by anyone ([to varying degrees](https://publicdomainsherpa.com/trademark.html)) as of January 1st, 2025. However, rather than use them as is, I ended up developing my take on the characters to make them a little more me. The differences help me avoid any trademark shenanigans by corporations, which is an unfortunate reality that still limits many great works that should be free and open.

Partly, I wanted to cover this in the book club because I've said multiple times that, for all the claims of an "explosion of creativity" when Mickey Mouse's earliest copyrights expired at the start of 2024, the introduction of Mickey Mouse into the public domain hasn't seemed to have any effect on the world.  This comic comes the closest to refuting my argument, though I note that "Steamboat" Mick Williams, with an original design, seems different enough from Mickey Mouse that I'd argue that this would have fallen under parody if published years prior.

## What Works Well?

While it seems to mostly prove my thesis that the "flowering of creativity" promised when the first Mickey Mouse copyrights expired by creating something that either lands squarely in the realm of parody or changes the characters so much that Disney's copyrights shouldn't apply, it does at least *try* to find a use for both Mickey and Popeye.  It takes some inspiration directly from those now-public domain stories, and integrates it into the comic's concept.

The comic also feels well done, at least over its short run, with a variety of frames of reference, angles, and techniques.

Oh, and the entire comic has a full transcript, for readers who need it.  The format will probably become harder to manage as (or if) the comic grows longer, but the fact that it exists at all benefits everybody.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Even accounting for the short run, the story seems remarkably thin, little more than two characters punching each other.  I suppose that the author might surprise us if the comic returns from hiatus, but we don't see more than that, here.

## Opportunities

The author mentions the following on the page, that he doesn't...

And there you go.

## What's Adaptable?

Apart from the off-model Mickey Mouse ("Steamboat" Mick Williams) and Popeye (Petey "Popeye" O'Neil), we have---sorry, but I do need to giggle at it---The Sloppy Stool port bar.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll play **Spacers Please**, a short game.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic?
