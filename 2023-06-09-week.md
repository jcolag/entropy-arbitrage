As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Honestly, I would prefer to see more of the non-coffin, shallow burials that have sprung up where legal, but this seems like a viable intermediate step for those who want to bridge both traditions.

Increasingly, I see people on social media talk about the hilarity of conservatives not defining the word "woke," because they apparently don't know what it means.  But they *do* know, and would rather pretend that they don't, because the definition hasn't changed, and saying that they oppose people understanding and challenging white supremacy and patriarchy *out loud* would make it harder to convince people that they have legitimate complaints.  Instead, they prefer to look foolish for a few seconds and move on.

Contrast this with the uproar seeing "Antifa" hiding behind every utility pole.  Once everyone understood that opposition to people who oppose fascism directly and openly supports fascism, they walked away from those fears, because actually *calling* themselves fascists undermines all the work that they've done to pretend that equality and mutual respect made for "real" fascism.

In other words, stop laughing that certain politicians won't define "woke."  Start making sure that everybody understands the definition, so that it exposes their racism.

(But also, don't call yourself "woke."  That misappropriates from Black culture, and pats yourself on the back instead of letting your actions speak for you.)

Congratulations to them, and I hope that this organizing continues to spread.  As many other writers have pointed out, unionization in at least the United States has consistently preceded changes in the size of the middle class.

Honestly, I can't believe that we still tolerate this kind of nonsense, all because the media loves the idea that the government spent a few hundred dollars on a person who didn't absolutely need it for survival.  To prevent that, we'll spend *millions* of dollars to build infrastructure that also accidentally fails to spend a few hundred dollars on people who absolutely *do* need it for survival.

Unfortunately, this comes down to fairly rudimentary math---specifically, that when you try to classify things, every system has false-positive errors (incorrectly including something that doesn't belong) and false-negative errors (incorrectly excluding something that does belong)---that people don't generally have enough of an intuition for, to demand that we actually track and compare the two kinds of errors.

Once you see this, you'll notice that it pervades political discourse.  In the criminal justice process, for example, *all* our civil liberties create false-negative errors, where we need to let someone go unpunished, because we couldn't prove to the jury that they committed the crime.  But inequality and bias create false-positive errors, such as the District Attorney convincing a poor defendant to take a plea deal and admit to a crime that they didn't commit, whereas a wealthier defendant can afford far better lawyers who can plant seeds of doubt.

Likewise, immigration, gun control, drug use, hate speech, surveillance, and many more issues come down to the same analysis:  How many innocent people can you afford to inconvenience, and how many crises do you feel willing to endure?  All of us have different tolerances for these, and almost every one of us has at least one maybe-different issue where we have *no* tolerance.  For a personal example, I oppose the death penalty, on the grounds that one innocent person executed by the state exceeds my tolerance, but a lot of people would probably pick one side or the other of gun control.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}
{% embed https://images.dailykos.com/images/1194580/story_image/GettyImages-1406985712-2.jpg|A Chick-fil-A employee assists a customer in a drive-thru line on July 05, 2022, in Houston, Texas|false| %}

 > The hand-wringing has continued to build, with misinformation extremists like Ian Miles Cheong writing, ‚ÄúDEI is literally wokeness,‚Äù and the unintentionally comedic videos of people enacting their boycotts have begun streaming in.

I honestly don't even know where to go with this, other than to laugh.  I mean, I knew that Republicans and their supporters had lost the thread, back when "my body, my choice" became a *sincere* assertion about not wearing masks, rather than the ironic appropriation of a pro-abortion slogan that they surely intended.  And I can see the movement repeatedly stumble and fall on its face, when it has voters alienated enough that they stop voting for Republicans, but too terrified to speak out, lest they find themselves alone.  But their turning against the worst of corporate America takes this to an impressive new level, where none of them---no matter how powerful---can trust any other.

 > Hla describes these resulting electrons as possessing spectrums that are like elemental "fingerprints," which can identify exactly what atom they're dealing with.

This, as many readers probably already know, rewrites a fair bit of science, if true.  I can remember a lot of time dedicated to explaining that an atomic nucleus doesn't have sufficient volume to image in any reasonable way---they exist on the scale of the particles or waves used to image them, which would make such an "image" little more than a probing---and electrons exist more as a probabilistic cloud than as physical objects.

Not only would this experiment upend that model, but it would also allow us to see nuclear processes and search objects for near-negligible physical defects, at least in theory.
