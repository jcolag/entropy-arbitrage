As I mentioned increasingly far back, somebody reached out to me asking a question that took me off guard.

![A logo representing Free Culture, featuring a sketch of three definitely generic modular brick toys stacked as a corner](/blog/assets/117878252_3c00463c07_o.png "I will continue hammering on this logo until a more entertaining solution presents itself...")

To wit.

> What's Free Culture?

And sure enough, looking back on almost six years of this blog, it looks like I somehow never touched on that.  This embarrassed me quite a bit, since I often try not to sink into jargon.  I *have* talked about [the movement and its failings]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}) and [why I care so much]({% post_url 2023-06-25-free-culture %}) about the idea, not to mention spending every Saturday morning trying to strong-arm you into checking out some project via the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club), yes.  But it doesn't look like I've ever defined the idea or how I see it.

## Recap

I kicked that process off last time with something of an [elevator pitch for Free Culture]({% post_url 2025-09-21-define-free-culture-1 %}), defining the idea in terms of a slight variation on the four freedoms generally associated with the Free Software movement.

- The freedom to experience the work as you wish, without restriction
- The freedom to study the work, and to create derivative works that say what you want
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others without restriction

I also talked a bit about why this might matter to us, especially in an age of constant media consolidation.  This time through, I want to talk a bit about why Free Culture should matter, and (maybe more importantly) what we want it to do for us.  Rather than focus on a specific framework like the four freedoms or antitrust, this post will come at the problem by thinking about art and culture in general.

## Broader Philosophy

Let's borrow some ideas from far smarter people than myself.  This might feel slightly disjointed, as I jump around history to cite people whose ideas that I want to stitch together at the end, but I believe that it'll come together as we go.

{% cw Because we'll jump around the past, it probably won't come as a surprise that we'll find gendered language, and many people cited *probably* have also expressed unfortunate views on gender, race, ability, and so forth, that I wouldn't otherwise risk bringing to the blog. %}

To start, in *Faith and Love or the King and the Queen* (1798), [Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr "Novalis" von Hardenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis) has this gem.

> Every person should be an artist; everything can become fine art.

Now, in context, the gem looks rougher, tied as the title implies to royalist nonsense likening elites to directors of artists---and so everyone---for whom we should do our best to participate in their grand designs.  However, he does muddle the metaphor with comments such as this one.

> ...stage and ground floor, actor and audience are one, and he himself is poet, director and hero of the play at the same time.

This twist feels almost anti-royalist, especially with the reuse of the director role, and so many people have taken the former line out of context that it might as well mean what it says with no allegorical equivalent, because they used it to mean that every person *should* engage in artistic pursuits.  And I think that frame has value, that creators and artists (and directors) shouldn't stand apart from the rest of us, because we can and should all make art.

On the latter, Jean-Jacques Rousseau in [**The Social Contract**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract) (1762), book III, makes this point, though referring to governance and fledgling democracies.

> The further from their source the public contributions are removed, the more burdensome they become.

Similarly, we have Ralph Waldo Emerson in [*The Poet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poet_%28essay%29) (1844).

> Every man should be so much an artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him.

Notice that this also broadens what we might mean by "art," including work that we might otherwise see as utilitarian in nature.  Journalism qualifies as cultural work, for example.

And we could look to John Ruskin in [**The Stones of Venice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stones_of_Venice_%28book%29), systemic sexism of earlier language aside.

> You must either make a tool of the creature, or a man of him. You cannot make both. Men were not intended to work with the accuracy of tools, to be precise and perfect in all their actions...You must not expect of them, any more than of the watch, to go on always ticking.

You could interpret this as accepting imperfection, which I think also works for us, in a sense.

More modern, I might also look to the late Craig Maloney's [**The Mediocre Programmer**](https://themediocreprogrammer.com/)[^LJH2k8] (2018), which has this to say.

[^LJH2k8]:  And you should *absolutely* read the book, by the way, even if you don't ever write a line of code, because Maloney never really says much that only applies to programming.  For example, count the number of occupations for which you've heard versions of this:  "The mediocre programmer wonders if it's even worth it. They wonder if they should do something else with their lives other than computer programming. Maybe they're not as good as they thought they were, or maybe they lack that special talent that great programmers have. Maybe they feel they learned the wrong things early on in their journeys, or maybe they think they should have started sooner."  Change the profession, and who does that *not* apply to, at some points?

> You have knowledge and experience they won't have, and they have experience and knowledge you don't have. If we strip away the barriers of perceived rank and meritocracy we can better engage with and learn from each other.

Notice that this adds a dimension to the earlier ideas of everybody participating in art and culture.  We don't necessarily do so because we'll do it better than anybody else so much as because each of us can contribute something that nobody else can.

With less twisting, I've almost certainly mentioned my enjoyment of [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski)'s **The Manhood of Humanity** (1921) before[^7wBCoq], with this lengthy quote, trying to explain the difference between humans and other animals without resorting to mystic or divine intervention or declaring us indistinguishable[^Id6wUq].

[^7wBCoq]:  I always hesitate to *recommend* the book, because while it has one of the most progressive stances that I've seen from the era---namely, that thinking about humanity in terms of "souls" setting us apart or "survival of the fittest" governing our behavior holds us back---Korzybski's work also influenced many of L. Ron Hubbard's choices as he crafted Scientology, among other weird legacies.

[^Id6wUq]:  Both those traditional interpretations, you might note, enable and even sometimes endorse exclusion and oppression.  If we have nothing separating us from animals, then we have no reason to treat people as anything more than means to accomplish certain ends.  And if the supernatural---souls, chosen by some deity, or granted some unique enhancement---separates us from other animals, then presumably some people can have more of that supernatural attribute than others.  Plus, I won't tell you to not accept the supernatural as part of your world, but it does seem worth noting strongly that neither traditional explanation has any known basis, whereas Korzybski cooperation across time does.

> The plants have a very definite and well known function---the transformation of solar energy into organic chemical energy. They are a class of life which appropriates one kind of energy, converts it into another kind and stores it up; in that sense they are a kind of storage battery for the solar energy; and so I define the plants as the chemistry-binding class of life.
>
> The animals use the highly dynamic products of the chemistry-binding class---the plants---as food, and those products---the results of plant-transformation---undergo in animals a further transformation into yet higher forms; and the animals are correspondingly a more dynamic class of life; their energy is kinetic; they have a remarkable freedom and power which the plants do not possess---I mean the freedom and faculty to move about in space; and so I define animals as the space-binding class of life.
>
> And now what shall we say of human beings? What is to be our definition of Man? Like the animals, human beings do indeed possess the space-binding capacity but, over and above that, human beings possess a most remarkable capacity which is entirely peculiar to them---I mean the capacity to summarize, digest and appropriate the labors and experiences of the past; I mean the capacity to use the fruits of past labors and experiences as intellectual or spiritual capital for developments in the present; I mean the capacity to employ as instruments of increasing power the accumulated achievements of the all-precious lives of the past generations spent in trial and error, trial and success; I mean the capacity of human beings to conduct their lives in the ever-increasing light of inherited wisdom; I mean the capacity in virtue of which man is at once the heritor of the by-gone ages and the trustee of posterity. And because humanity is just this magnificent natural agency by which the past lives in the present and the present for the future, I define humanity, in the universal tongue of mathematics and mechanics, to be the time-binding class of life.

I have often summarized this idea as plants making available food, animals (including humans) making homes, and humans---through communication, especially writing, and increasingly recording---making culture and civilizations.  Many other animals seem to have significant intelligence and/or cooperative impulses, but as far as we know, only humans have the capacity to build relationships with and *cooperate with* people who we'll never meet, separated by thousands of miles or even thousands of years.

And you all know the big quote here, I assume, from [Isaac Newton's 1675 letter](https://discover.hsp.org/Record/dc-9792/Description) to Robert Hooke.

> ...if I have seen further [than others], it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

The idea of giants calls to mind geniuses, though, and I feel like we've learned in the intervening centuries that neither science nor culture really moves forward through strokes of genius or finding giants.  Rather, to extend the standing metaphor, each of us stands on a platform built by our predecessors, and we build platforms atop them for our successors to climb a bit higher.  Routine research, and routine art, has enough variation in it and enough small innovations driving it, that it creates far more opportunities for advancement than a single genius could ever provide.

And that brings me to the Leo Tolstoy's [**What Is Art**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F) (1898).

> Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestation of some mysterious Idea of beauty, or God; it is not, as the aesthetical physiologists say, a game in which man lets off his excess of stored-up energy; it is not the expression of manâs emotions by external signs; it is not the production of pleasing objects; and, above all, it is not pleasure; but it is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress towards well-being of individuals and of humanity.

Tolstoy also includes in his definition of art church services, jokes, and home decoration, tying into my broader description of cultural works, earlier.  It resonates with Korzybski's thesis that the distinctiveness of humanity definitely exists, but it doesn't come from some entity declaring us distinct, in doing the same for art and culture.  As we might define humans by the ability and drive to cooperate across time, Tolstoy defines art as the mechanism by which that happens.  And if you want to drill deeper on the mechanism, look no further than the metaphorical standing on shoulders of Newton.

Likewise, but down a separate path, we can look at [Friedrich Schiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller)'s **Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters** (1794).

> Man is only fully human when he plays.

Those two ideas, art as union and humans needing play (or art) also brings to mind the philosophy of lowercase-u [ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), I believe best (or perhaps most usefully) translated as this blunt statement.

> I am because we are.

This has a few levels to it, if you think about it.  Why do I exist?  I exist because my ancestors existed.  Why do I survive and thrive?  I survive and thrive because society has built infrastructure that enables a lot more than our ancestors had.  Why do I matter?  I matter because of my relationships[^wwT7JZ], because I care about people, and they care about me.  We need connection.  Culture and society make us.

[^wwT7JZ]:  While I haven't thought about it in these terms, my guideline of not talking about my private life on the blog probably has a lot to do with the ideas behind this statement.  I can't talk about a work situation without pointing a finger at colleagues.  I can't talk about living conditions without pointing a finger at my neighbors and the like.  You get the idea, we embody our connections more than anything else.  They didn't consent to a spotlight shining on them, even with names redacted.

Another jump to the present, and we can check out Maria Fossatti's [*Free Culture As Positive Freedom*](https://www.articaonline.com/2024/05/la-cultura-libre-como-libertad-positiva/) (2024), which I've translated from the original Spanish.

> Free culture in terms of positive freedom is the idea that there must be abundant, accessible, and plural cultural resources, so that all people and collectives can participate freely and equitably from cultural life. The militancy for Free Culture is not merely the defense of property and individual freedom, but the active search for the expansion of the right of access, use, and participation in culture for society as a whole. This includes the radical democratization of creativity, critical thinking, practical knowledge, aesthetic pleasure, entertainment, identity, and cultural heritage.

To aggregate that with what we've already seen, art and culture come from the human need to reach out to others, who we may never meet, and Free Culture sees it as an inalienable right to participate in that (attempt at) connection.

We can also toss in the old [Students for Free Culture manifesto](https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080918031217/http://freeculture.org/manifesto/) (c. 2008), since it touches on some of the same issues from a different perspective.  I don't buy into all of it, but I can't fault the utopian zeal.

> The mission of the Free Culture movement is to build a bottom-up, participatory structure to society and culture, rather than a top-down, closed, proprietary structure. Through the democratizing power of digital technology and the Internet, we can place the tools of creation and distribution, communication and collaboration, teaching and learning into the hands of the common person---and with a truly active, connected, informed citizenry, injustice and oppression will slowly but surely vanish from the earth.

I think that covers the spectrum of ideas that I wanted to borrow from.  And yes, everything comes from a source either in the public domain or released under the terms of a Free Culture license[^SIJzyY].

[^SIJzyY]:  We'll talk in more detail about licenses in a future post in this series.

## Putting This Together

I realize that this involved a lot of bouncing around, but I hope that you can see the pieces falling into place.

We need to reach out and connect with others to become ourselves, and we often do that through cultural works, conversations with:

- The past, our inspirations and sources;
- The present, our peers who we hope to influence; and
- The future, those who we hope to reach and inspire.

The work represents hope, trust, strength, and compassion, the act of reaching out and (ideally, if not always) finding somebody.  And every work, no matter how small, serious, or polished[^wa8nCX], elevates us---dignifying, enriching, even ennobling us---because we can build on it to move forward, bringing us together as a community.

[^wa8nCX]:  I might argue that Free Culture diverges from---or forms a superset of, if you'd rather think of it that way---Free Software and similar utility-oriented areas of unbounded collaboration, in this sense.  Poorly executed or mostly joking code probably doesn't really contribute to the larger body of work, because it can often take more effort to rehabilitate a small contribution than to do it over.  That doesn't make those attempts bad or unimportant, because we all need to start somewhere, and occasionally they might spur a more thorough idea, so...maybe it doesn't diverge as much as I thought?  I can't think of any serious software (or feature) inspired by a one-off joke, but it certainly could happen.

Anybody can and *should* do this work, for a few reasons.

- Each of us has something unique to contribute, expanding the culture;
- Creating cultural works connects us, in the ways described above; and
- We often enjoy it;

And maybe critically, this serves as an alternative, parallel[^ynXWlx] set of cultural works, where we don't differentiate between creator and audience, and we resist centralization.

[^ynXWlx]:  I have noted before that I see Free Culture as distinct from the broader culture, though we share the public domain.  Though if you want to dwell on negative liberties---you can probably guess that I don't---we could point out that we actually have *many* distinct non-Free cultures, because the details of modern Intellectual Property law make it difficult for even centralized studios of creators to use works by other creators, likewise for independent creators.

That feels like a great model for culture in general.  At its best, Free Culture helps us to do that, by making every work a solicitation for collaboration.  Ideally, it *drives* us to do that, by prodding us to join our inspirations, our peers, and our intended audience into a community.

If you want to distill that further, then try this:  **Humans need to create and share, creating culture; Free Culture sees this as an inalienable right**.  It won't fit on a bumper sticker or into a protest slogan, but it *would* have fit into an early-days tweet[^zp_J4S], complete with extra space for retweet attribution.  Heck, it even fits in a weird-looking QR code with plenty of error correction.

[^zp_J4S]:  Not that anybody measures anything that way anymore, with the size restriction, name, and cultural cachet all long gone...

![A level-9 QR code, using dots and crosses in near-primary colors, representing my distilled summary of Free Culture](/blog/assets/inalienable-right-qr.png "I gather that many of these fancy-pants QR codes don't actually comply with the standard, so I shouldn't use them, but I've done this for illustrative purposes, not communication...")

I suppose that, in this sense, the statement would probably scan properly from a bumper sticker as a three-inch-tall QR code, though I'd recommend a more conventional appearance if you wanted to try that.

## What We Don't See

I want to gesture at the ideas that "mysteriously" didn't make it onto the list, ideas often more closely associated with Free Culture, Free Software, and the like.

We don't find anybody insisting that [information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free).  You could argue that it didn't matter before copying information became cheap, but looking at the early context of that premise, I can't help noticing that this and similar sentiments seem to connect more with the rise of the software industry, creating systems that want to *consume* vast amounts of information.  And why pay for what (allegedly) wants you to take it?  How does "information wants to be free" differ from Meta claiming that the seven million books that they pirated to train AI have [no economic value {% cc %}](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/meta-ai-lawsuit)?

Similarly, nothing here appeals to some romanticized past when we had the free flow of "content," or the days prior to copyright when "anybody" could modify and release modified media.  Among other problems, like the capital involved in publishing in previous centuries, this era never really existed, because most cultures have recognized some version of what we now call [moral rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights).

And none of this tries to prescribe a structure, nor does it suggest that one must inevitably emerge from randomized behavior.  Free Culture *could* happen in a variety of ways, ranging from accidental to carefully structured.

Apart from my quick refutations, those all get into the space of negative liberties[^rOeZM3], limiting arguments to those which oppose people from restricting your actions.  Rather, I have tried to assemble a body of ideas to move more towards *positive liberty*, empowering and authorizing the audience to form a community that can take ownership of cultural works.

[^rOeZM3]:  I have wanted to write these posts, especially this post, at least partly because of the libertarian (and more right-wing) stench that has pervaded the space, as people cite and praise the (sarcasm quotes) "important" people who built many of the foundational aspects.  I mean, you can't swing a dead *[Mus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus_%28genus%29) [disnii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse)* without finding somebody raving wide-eyed about [*A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace*](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) casting the Internet as beyond "property, expression, identity, movement, and context," or [**The Cathedral and the Bazaar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) by the guy who believes every right-wing conspiracy theory, or pretty much anything written by [Antonin Scalia's former law clerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig), or anything by the [culturally insensitive transphobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Paley).  And you can't have that at the root of a movement about inclusion and sharing and expect it to work.  I may come back to this later in these posts more explicitly, but I wanted to make sure that it at least got a mention.

At its best, Free Culture focuses on creating those voluntary connections---coming together to create---not on exploiting the work of people who didn't consent to it.

## Coming Soon

This post gives some idea of how Free Culture fits into the broader context of art and culture, and why, when it works well, it might feel like these projects help fix our atomized and maybe-broken culture.  When we get to the third part of this, we'll change direction again, slightly, and talk about the various threads of history that Free Culture pulls on.  And yes, that'll probably include a long digression on copyright and how the public domain looked for so long like the central allied cause of people actively sharing...even though copyright already let you share.

See you then...
