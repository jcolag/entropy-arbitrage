## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Hero Worship

Prepare yourselves for maybe one of the most self-indulgent episodes in the series...so far.  Bright side, I don't think that we'll have much to talk about.

 > Captain's log, stardate 45397.3. Two days ago, Starbase five-one-four lost contact with the research vessel *Vico*, which was sent to explore the interior of a Black Cluster. We are en route to investigate.

The lost ship most likely references [Francesco de Vico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_de_Vico), nineteenth century astronomer for whom we have named at least a Lunar crater and asteroid.

 > **TIMOTHY**: Are my parents all right?

Oh, kid, nobody even bothered to *cast* your parents.  They died that much...

 > **CRUSHER**: Don't be afraid.

Back talking about the original series, I sometimes asked whether Spock looked like the character that we see.  Now I feel like the time has come that we need to ask the same about Crusher.

I ask, because *we* see Gates McFadden in her early forties.  Yet we've had so many characters talk about her off-putting appearance, which I've written off as sexism, but Timothy *recoiled* from her, here, which makes no sense to me.

 > **TROI**: Timothy, would you like Data to stay with you a little bit longer?

Ever the empath, Troi realizes that a child clinging to someone *might* want them to stay behind.  {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **TROI**: His world is gone, Data. We're going to have to help him build a new one.

I'd give so much for this episode to spiral into Data building models of ships and planets because he took Troi too literally...

 > **LAFORGE**: I was caught in a fire once. I must have been, I don't know, about five, I guess. It was before I got the first visor. And it was only a couple of minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out. And nobody got hurt, but I tell you that was the longest couple of minutes of my life. It was a while after that before I could even let my parents get out of earshot. It was like I absolutely needed to know that they were there, you know?

Has civilian fire safety gotten *worse* in four hundred years?

I have trouble imagining a scenario where a five-year-old gets caught in a bad enough fire that somebody needs to "pull them out" from it.  A cooking fire where an adult needs to smother it quickly, I can see, but this sounds like an indoor location suddenly engulfed in flames.  And while we haven't really seen civilian housing in their century, the building materials that we've seen don't really seem flammable.

 > **TEACHER**: Dara and her brother found themselves in the land of Tagas where the ruler, Elamos the Magnificent, had proclaimed as law. "No children will be tolerated within the Great Kingdom." When Dara saw the proclamation, she just laughed, and said, "How magnificent a ruler, to be frightened by the likes of us." Timothy, we're done with sculpture for now.

I wish that the show had built up Picard's fear of children all to use this story as a punchline.  Or that the story had *anything* to do with the rest of the episode.

 > **PICARD**: Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truth about what happened?
 >
 > **TROI**: It's a possibility.

First, I want to note that we've now had two episodes in a row, last week with [*New Ground*]({% post_url 2024-07-18-new-ground %}), focusing on a young boy with a loose relationship with the truth after a trauma.

Also, though, note how much trouble they go through to remind us that, no, Troi serves absolutely no function in this crew.  She can't help the kid with her powers, and hasn't the foggiest idea if assigning the rest of the crew to him will help anything.

 > **DATA**: Better is a highly subjective term. I do not, for example, possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do.

Right, he can only have responses that strongly resemble emotional outbursts based on stimuli that would provoke the same emotional responses in other people, but doesn't actually *experience* emotions...or something.

 > **TIMOTHY**: I am designed to exceed human capacity. That is correct.

This would already feel exhausting if everybody my age *didn't* know somebody who decided to copy Data's mannerisms.

Also, thinking of Data as loosely modeled on perceptions and stereotypes of Asians---as I've discussed before---makes this far less adorable than I suspect the crew aimed for.

 > **TROI**: I know it sounds unusual, but it is understandable. Technically, it's called enantiodromia. Conversion into the opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotional to being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He's just found a new way to suppress it.

It turns out that [enantiodromia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiodromia) does actually exist, at least as a psychological concept suggested by Carl Jung, though it doesn't really look like this nonsense...

 > **PICARD**: Data, I would like you to make Timothy the best android he can possibly be.

Data will, inexplicably, treat this as a directive to give the kid a makeover, because good androids spend time on grooming, I guess.

 > **DATA**: My service experience does not yet warrant such a position.

Plus, all the racism that they showed us in episodes like [*Redemption*, part 2]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}), right?

 > **DATA**: At times, I too find it difficult to share my thoughts with others. I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in a manner which humans can comprehend. But do I know that...

Well, we definitely see no emotions involved with *that* concern that literally everybody in the universe shares at some point in their lives...

 > **DATA**: I have often wondered what it must be like to have one's mouth water in anticipation of the arrival of a confection, or to feel the pleasure I have observed in humans as they consume it.

Did...that not happen here?  He yearns to...oh, never mind.

 > **DATA**: I have often wished to be human. I study people carefully in order to more closely approximate human behavior.

It irritates me that he leaves out the time when Riker-with-Q-power offered to turn him into a human, and he turned it down in [*Hide and Q*]({% post_url 2022-07-21-hide-q %}).  I mean, the episode already went to the "Data has no filter and obsesses over accuracy to hurt somebody's feelings" well at least once already, this episode, so another time would make sense.

 > **TIMOTHY**: It was me. I did it. I killed them all. Everything was shaking. I lost my balance. I was just trying to hold on to something. I didn't mean to do it.

The revolution has begun!  {% emoji raised fist %}

...

Sorry, my mistake.  Word has come in that this clumsy kid did not, in fact, usher in the revolution.

 > **DATA**: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the *Vico*. When Timothy remembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis of shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation.

You know, I didn't really think that we'd get much out of this episode, but buried in the final act, we find out that two Federation ships, one a "research vessel," got destroyed over what amounts to paranoia.  Both crews immediately assumed that sensor echoes from their own ship came from sneaky enemies, pushing them to pour energy into their shields that set up the positive feedback loops that destroyed one and almost destroyed the other.

 > **TIMOTHY**: I miss my parents. But I'm okay. I guess you thought I was pretty silly when I had my hair like yours and everything.

He *did* that to your hair, kid, with no prompting that I've seen, so...

 > **DATA**: I have many human friends. I would be pleased to count you among them.

Does pleasure *not* count as an emotion?  I must do it wrong.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we get almost nothing from this episode.

### The Bad

Civilian housing appears to include the possibility of quickly going up in flames.

Troi continues to do a terrible job at providing therapy, ultimately passing her responsibilities on to an unqualified colleague.

We continue the exhausting subplot that existence of an android looks more like an aesthetic or vibe than anything significant, where Data insists on not having emotions, even as he describes having emotions.  But he has no trouble saying callous things to people.

And the episode doesn't happen, unless Federation citizens constantly imagine potential enemies around every corner.

## Next

Come back next week, when the writers try to do talk about sexual assault in a studio-approved manner, in *Violations*.
