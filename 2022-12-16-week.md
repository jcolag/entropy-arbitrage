As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), Fridays host my weekly Twitter roundups.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The Treaty of Fort Pitt, also known as the Delaware Treaty, included a provision for a delegate should the Delaware Nation ever form a state and join the fledgling union...

Every once in a while---and I really should put a full post together---I wonder what Congress and the United States in general would look like if everybody who the government had authority over, *including* occupied territories, had proportional representation in Congress.  Would we have a country that included Japanese and Filipino states, or would we cut Puerto Rico, Guam, other "territories," and Native American tribes loose to become sovereign countries?  How would that affect the balance of power?

 > However, as with the first study, proactive coping had no effect for older adults.

This follows up on a study that I *believe* I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, fleshing out the limitations of the findings.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1603027277360635904) [The Author of Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Law Just Got Indicted for Money Laundering](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88q35a/florida-rep-joe-harding-dont-say-gay-author-indicted-money-laundering) from VICE News

 > Harding was indicted for money laundering, wire fraud, and making false statements, and faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.

Around the world, I don't think that we draw nearly enough attention to the fact that regressive politicians and governments almost all have ties to oil money and serious criminal activity.  Maybe we should take their policies less seriously and stop treating them like they have honest ideas?

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1603390672194732035) [Good News for the 65 Million Americans Who Rely on Social Security](https://otherwords.org/good-news-for-the-65-million-americans-who-rely-on-social-security/) from OtherWords

 > Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, who will be House Speaker next year, says he will take a must-pass debt limit bill hostage to cut our earned Social Security benefits.

Not mentioned in the article, because most people don't think of things this way, but Social Security stands as a complete embarrassment to Republican policy.  They know full well that the program costs no money in the budget, so that cutting the program wouldn't "shrink government" at all.  Rather, it stands as blatant, unambiguous evidence that we can lift people out of poverty by *giving them money*.  And that exposes their "see government as the problem, not the solution" philosophy as invalid.

 > These are some of the brands shaking up the athleisure industry by adding their own cultural touch.

I don't have much use for sportswear, but I like seeing regional companies pick up.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Scientists Discover Oldest DNA Ever, Revealing 2 Million-Year-Old Lost World](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88q3xa/scientists-discover-oldest-dna-ever-revealing-2-million-year-old-lost-world) from VICE Motherboard

 > This tantalizing vision has one notable omission: Carnivores. While no traces of predators were found in the eDNA samples, Willerslev’s team suggested that this was simply because carnivore populations tend to be far smaller than herbivore populations, producing a sampling bias.

While hardly a critical story, I do find it interesting.
