# Entropy Arbitrage

This repository contains the source files for [John Colagioia's blog](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/).  From here, you can:

 * File [an issue](https://github.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage/issues) to suggest a correction.
 * Fork the repository to [create a pull request](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/github-pull-request-tutorial/#Time-to-Submit-Your-First-PR), if you feel more motivated to help fix errors.  Just keep in mind that dissenting opinions make more sense as comments or for posts on your own blog, not trying to convince me to publish your thoughts.
 * Use the posts however you please, provided that you agree to the terms of the [CC-BY-SA license](https://github.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

But if you only came here to read, you'd probably have a better time heading for [the blog itself](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/), where you can see any pictures or other media attached.

## Assets

Because it carries a lot of data, I've opted not to include the blog's `assets` folder here.  If you need to reconstruct the blog, you'll need to track down the fonts, JavaScript, CSS, and especially the media.

For my own convenience, though, and usable to anybody who needs it, I created [a repository for the assets](https://gitlab.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-assets), which automatically updates on Tuesdays.
