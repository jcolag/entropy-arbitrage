This week, I want to return to the [thirty million dollar](/blog/tag/30million) conceit after a few months on other topics, to talk a bit about how we might get normal people to look at some of the best of Free Culture, if we had the resources and motivation to pull it off.

![A film crew in what looks like an office park](/blog/assets/2254716464_684c033f4d_o.png "Somehow, I imagine less flannel in Free Culture...")

Before we dive into it, though, let's give this post some broader context...

## Thirty Million Dollar Preface

Back in January, a group of Silicon Valley folks launched their [Free Our Feeds <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://freeourfeeds.com/) campaign, a buzzword-laden, [shady-looking](https://tante.cc/2025/01/13/but-does-it-free-our-feeds/) initiative that aims to raise anywhere between four and thirty million dollars, forecasting an eventual need for *hundreds* of millions, to create a foundation that would attempt building a second server ("relay") for Bluesky's AT protocol, and *maybe* create some other applications using the protocol.

You could---as the second link does---ask what makes this different from Bluesky Public Benefit Corporation.  You could ask why it takes millions of dollars to create (not run) a social media server that only follows an existing protocol, when [Bluesky already releases its source code](https://github.com/bluesky-social).  Heck, you could even ask (as I did in a comment on that post) why they seem to entirely ignore Christine Lemmer-Webber's [post about Bluesky's potential decentralization](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/) in their plan, which seems to suggest that they might not get too far.  Other questions arise, too.  Why bother lavishing so much attention on AT, when ActivityPub already does more than they want?  Why do so many of their nine "custodians" have deep connections to LLM startups?  Couldn't those nine custodians, mostly wealthy in their own right, scrape up their "minimum" of four million dollars between them, if this project strikes them as so important?  Do they think that anybody will support this because Mark Ruffalo---owning assets worth tens of millions in his own right---signed their open letter?

Me, though?  I'd rather ask how one raises thirty million dollars and, if somebody wanted to give me that kind of money, what I could accomplish with it primarily relating to and supporting Free Culture.  That leads me to the second of these [thirty million dollar](/blog/tag/30-million) posts, an irregular, occasional series where I---ideally *we*, but I realize that getting involved feels like it takes commitment---think through some in-an-ideal-world projects, at least partly for entertainment purposes.  But in an *ideal* (and redundant) ideal world, I also hope that somebody might point out that, as a community, we could do this all at minimal cost and go kick off the project.

OK, in an even-better-than-ideal world, I wouldn't turn thirty million dollars down to make these things happen with your paid help.  That doesn't seem particularly likely, though.  But call me {% emoji telephone receiver %} with offers...

In short, think of these posts as somewhere between a laugh at the small imaginations/high costs of the modern software industry and wishful thinking of the things that we could have with enough resources.

### Details, Details

I do want to mention, as I go through this, that since I kicked off this semi-silly project of projects that could improve Free Culture in an ideal world with sufficient funding, that Free Our Feeds appears to have noticed their silly optics and scaled back their fund-raising to "only" half a million dollars.  They also seem to now send at least some of what they have raised to projects *already* wrapping up what they claimed that they would eventually try to do, if fully funded.

They still strike me as extremely silly, especially since their money also seems to send their already-wealthy rear ends to conferences, and vanishing ["for the endless holidays of northern summer"](https://free-our-feeds.ghost.io/free-our-feeds-update-4-october-2025/) (I have no idea what holidays they mean).  But even though I still use the thirty-million-dollar framing for these posts, they no longer *ask* for that kind of funding.

Anyway, next up?  Getting Free Culture works in front of people.

## Free Culture Studio

A while back, I wrote a post about the need for many modern equivalents of [Roger Corman]({% post_url 2024-05-26-corman %}), churning out low-budget film adaptations of various works.  I like the idea, because while the major studios have become factories churning out media franchise installments to minimize their risks, I read so many obscure, relatively current novels that I suspect would become popular favorites, *if* they could find an audience.

And so I occasionally fantasize about hiring those hypothetical Corman-like people to do work in a space that specifically interests me.  I don't want to count everything, right now, but the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) alone has covered (probably a low estimate) dozens of prose, comic, and game projects.  Not all of them would necessarily work as a low-budget live-action or animated feature, but I'd bet that a lot of them would.  It only takes somebody with the---remember the problem, here---time and money to bring together a team to make it happen on a regular basis.

### The Problem to Solve

As you can guess by the fact that I haven't walked away from the Saturday posts in disgust, yet, I believe that the material released under Free Culture licenses at *least* has a lot of potential, and I have enjoyed a lot of it.  Deep in my cold, black heart, I believe that most people would find the same, though not necessarily in the same set of works.

However, those "most people" probably *won't* have the same reaction as me.  Why not?  They'll never see or hear about those works.  The major studios all have direct pipes to people's houses, in the form of streaming apps.  Get past that, and they have the resources to market every project to the point that you'll know the releases even if you don't care about them.  Cut through that, and they still have the breadth of organization to flood the market and drown out other releases.

And yes, sometimes an independent work does break through into the popular consciousness.  The big publishers don't have an exclusive stranglehold on their industries.  But consider the question that I posed when talking about the [Free Culture Movement]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}) about a year and a half ago:  When did you last hear a normal person---someone other than a zealot for independent media, I mean---express their excitement about some release outside the biggest publishers?  And how much further back in your memory would you need to dig if A24's films didn't count?

Creators of Free Culture works have orders of magnitude less funding than a company such as A24, let alone a Disney, an Electronic Arts, or a Penguin Random House.  I can't think of anybody who has managed to make Free Culture their career.  We all do this in our spare time, usually with no budget.

### Examples

Let's take the idea for a spin, to give some idea of what this hypothetical studio could do.  For my own convenience, I'll use the list of [Free Culture Book Club posts](/blog/tag/book-club) as a guide, but realize that much more material exists out there.  And you can also consider this a guide to projects that I think that you should look at, even if you don't read the Book Club posts.  (Also, brace yourself for a *long* list.)

The [Floraverse]({% post_url 2020-05-23-seeds %}) has already made for a fun comic with occasional forays into other kinds of media, but to make it more approachable to casual audiences, imagine it as an adult animation series.  We have a distinct style, and presents a fun kind of humor/cosmic horror setting.  And it has a *lot* of material to borrow from.

You might also look at [**Forgotten**]({% post_url 2020-07-04-forgotten %}) as a potential source.  The in-game material probably would work as a film on its own, but imagine its story paired with a "real-world" drama in the player's life, which they need to navigate while trying to help the characters in this old game, maybe even seeking out people who can help.

I'll probably mention a bunch of novels, here, but [**Manuel, the Magnificent Mechanical Man**]({% post_url 2020-07-11-manuel %})---the "dieselpunk novel with Spanish-created robot hobos kicking sawdust in the circus in a balkanized America at the beginning of the XXth century"---would need streamlining, I think, but the alternate-universe "All-Races" Florida that broke away from a collapsing Confederacy, and the aforementioned diesel-era robot, feels like the right hands could turn it into an incredible film.

Then, while we technically already got something like six hours of the story, I can't help imagining a remake of [**Where Are the Joneses?**]({% post_url 2020-09-26-joneses1 %}).  Sure, the inspiration---the news item about the many children of a sperm donor who found each other---feels outdated, but that partly suggests to me that it could use a refresh.  Full-length episodes would also probably help; I don't know if anybody (**Bluey** fans excepted) get excited about consuming television a few minutes at a time anymore...

I vaguely remember the author recommending that I read a different series after I published the blog post, but I found [**Drakes**]({% post_url 2020-10-24-drakes %}) highly cinematic.  And arguably, the agent suffering from (something like) post-traumatic stress feels like a modern hook into the world.

This list would feel horrible if I didn't call out [**Pepper & Carrot**]({% post_url 2020-12-19-pepper %}), wouldn't it?  Some teams have already tried creating animated versions of some scenes, but none have really succeeded beyond showing that they could do it.  But I can see this as either animated *or* live-action, maybe with newer companion strip **Mini Fantasy Theater** used to cover transitions.

The time may have past for [**Headshot**]({% post_url 2021-07-17-headshot %})'s maybe-multiverse shenanigans, and nobody can really use the epilogue, but it does the job well enough (once it gets moving) that I could see a lot of people enjoying a filmed version of this.  And I've said many times that I could see this story fitting together with [**Valkaama**]({% post_url 2021-03-27-valkaama %}).

And while it would need a serious edit to give it a reasonable ending, not to mention removing some awful characters who suck up far too much of the word count, [**Dustrunners: Typhoon**]({% post_url 2021-08-07-typhoon1 %}) sticks in my memory as definite movie material.

Another one where the inciting inspiration no longer feels current, but [**Occupy This Novel!**]({% post_url 2021-10-23-occupy1 %}) and the other *Occupy This* works have a fun idea that a clever writer could use to propagandize for Free Culture without preaching about it.  After all, the concept revolves around characters with little commercial viability taking control of their own destinies, while corporate-security tries to take them down.

And while it'd need to tone down its exposition, [**if then else**]({% post_url 2021-11-13-else %}) has somehow become *more* relevant over the almost-decade since the author released it, not less.  I could argue that 2025 *needs* a film about a self-taught Black programmer who needs to defend herself against bogus terrorism charges.

[**Redmine**]({% post_url 2022-11-19-redmine-1 %}) probably needs some editing so that it would make sense to people not familiar with the [eponymous software](https://www.redmine.org/), not to mention a good translation to English[^iawLYf], but it actually (still) surprises me a bit that magic via project management software hasn't become a common trope in film.  And this book does it well.

[^iawLYf]:  Any language works, here, but since I predominantly understand English, I think of a project like this in that sense.  And as Free Culture, we'd want to structure these films so that people could quickly translate them into their preferred language.

While [**Random Vignettes**]({% post_url 2023-05-13-vignettes %}) probably wouldn't work as film, I probably *should have* used that post for the other (major) Jectoons comic, [**Duso**](https://duso.jectoons.net/).  And Duso would make a lot of sense as a voiceless, surreal cartoon.

As a fan of mystery stories with a twist, and an almost pathological disinclination for trying to solve the crime before the detective, I love the idea of a feature-length [**Death off the Cuff**]({% post_url 2023-05-20-death-cuff %}), with its ill-prepared armchair detective realizing, as he brings the suspects together, that he doesn't actually *know* who committed the murder.

I have to admit that [**Noir & Blanc**]({% post_url 2024-04-13-noir-blanc-1 %}) set me down this path of wanting these stories more widely available, because Crowdagger consistently turns in fantastic books...in both senses of the adjective.  Here, not only does it take more effort to "sell" people on reading a novel than on watching a feature-length film, but we'd also need a solid translation from the French.  And in this case, we have a vaguely queer "buddy road-trip" in a meditation on good and evil.

[**Nevada**]({% post_url 2024-06-08-nevada-1 %}) may or may not have a professional film adaptation in some stage of development, and I didn't so much care for it, *but* it seems important enough that I can't leave it off the list.  And really, I do believe that, with some minor editing, the story could work extremely well.

If only because we don't have anything else like it, I also can't leave the [*Aether Age Codex*]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %}) stories off the list.  The collection spans something like five hundred years of fictional history, so I don't imagine that it'd work well as a single film, but an anthology series could work.

We might need to wait a while longer until we have enough story to say for sure, but [**Antumbra**]({% post_url 2024-08-17-antumbra %}) at least has the makings of an interesting film.

While I never finished it, because the blog needed to move onto other projects, [**Restoration Day**]({% post_url 2024-10-12-restoration-day-1 %})'s first few chapters have the shape of an adventure/coming-of-age film.

The [**First Woman**]({% post_url 2025-06-21-first-woman-1 %}) could work well as a live action project for children.  Like other projects, it might take some editing to smooth out the problematic bits, but it could work.

And, finally, while on the subject of material for children, [**Ardvark the Aardvark**]({% post_url 2025-09-06-ardvark %}) already feels like a cartoon, despite the fact that we don't have much more than prose for it.

If you have a favorite project that didn't make it to my personal list, please don't take offense.  Between projects that already want to move to film, projects that I don't see working as film at all, and others[^3FwgiK], I can't list everything, let alone imagine adapting them.  I also ignored the two collections of children's books---[Book Dash]({% post_url 2020-09-12-bookdash %}) and [Pratham]({% post_url 2020-11-28-pratham %})---because that feels like it demands its own structure.  Likewise, I would imagine that so many projects exist that I've never even heard of, as I point out in every Saturday post.

[^3FwgiK]:  Yes, in some cases, my personal disinterest in a story might have made it difficult for me to suggest as a film.

Regardless of those caveats, it gives an indication of the scope.

And bear in mind that *you* could do these things, too, my entire point.  We all have permission to work in these worlds, whether to lift the work up or to fix it.  When I pitch this as "a thing that we could do," I mean that I'd probably happily throw millions of dollars at it (if I had it) to make sure that everybody involved gets fairly compensated, but also that I have no objections if the idea inspires you to do it instead.

### Content Farm

I would also like to push this idea further.  We often denigrate it when a film studio also owns a publisher of some other media, such as books or comics.  They only want it, we say, to test out material for future films.

And yet...that makes sense.  Use the cheaper-to-produce medium to experiment, then adapt the most successful ideas for a broader audience.  Everybody wins, and I don't know why we see it as a problem.

Therefore, this sort of enterprise would *also* pay people to produce that "source material"---new prose, comic, and game projects---with the intent of adapting them, creating a fairly complete pipeline from concept to adaptation(s) to distribution.  While anybody can adapt Free Culture works, it happens rarely enough that an organization dedicated to showing that people can do it quickly and cheaply, documenting every step of the process for people to review, might go a long way.

## Alternatively

Note that this sort of project doesn't actually *need* ties to Free Culture.  Plenty of independent works also exist that would benefit from somebody getting the rights cheaply, since almost nobody knows about most novels no matter their quality or relevance to current events, and putting together a low-budget adaptation to help attract greater interest.  Independent filmmakers do that all the time, in fact, often without the benefit of a full studio behind them.

In that sense, minus Free Culture, this idea already exists in the form of independent studios.  They all start somewhere a lot like "get the rights to something interesting cheap, then produce it."

Plus, Free Culture skips the "acquire the rights" step, since the creator has already granted those rights to the public.  And doing it this way creates more Free Culture to maybe inspire somebody else, so I prefer to keep this version of the idea in that space.

## Why Thirty Million

I've hinted at this, but I do want to explicitly talk about what would make this a possible "thirty-million-dollar project."  (Presumably, nobody needs me to explain why the project would benefit more people than the Bluesky nonsense.)

In short, a project like this would require plenty of effort and resources.  You can already see that in the list of examples above, with the number of projects that would need adjustment and (in some cases) overhauling.  And that doesn't even get to the work of adapting an arbitrary story to a screenplay.

Then, you have equipment to film and produce everything.  An ideal version of this studio would---as hinted above---also include a streaming service, so that collaborators can have a hand in every step from the initial ideas to delivering a completed film to your living room.

And then we have labor costs.  Look at the credits for any significant film, and you'll notice at least dozens of people working on it, and those people need and deserve payment for their time and effort.  A unionized camera operator---yes, support organized labor---makes about sixty bucks an hour, I gather, assuming that the production can limit the work-day to eight hours.  Now add everybody else, and you can see the budget for doing this well climbing quickly...

## Wrapping Up

Admittedly, this does have some obstacles to actually taking off, even if we had everything needed.  As with all media projects, this still requires breaking into the public consciousness, in cultures where we've spent decades training people to see the output of major studios as the high bar for quality.

And once again, I have no actual intention of taking this project on, much as I'd love to.  Alone, I'd never get even one film produced in my lifetime, at least not if we wanted something with any level of quality.  With a bunch of talented volunteers, it could happen, but I'd feel guilty for that many people not getting material support for their altruism and labor.  But if somebody wanted to throw a few million dollars my way, I could probably make it happen...

And heck, as long as we've gone down the road of joking about giving me money, I might as well quietly remind anybody making it down this far---and thank you for enduring this goofy idea for a series of posts---that you could throw me *significantly* less than thirty million dollars through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jcolag/), or even [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/dR614J5vM8na9eU9AA) directly, if you so desired, and it will go directly to manifesting wild ideas. {% emoji person shrugging %}

I really only add those because the topic turned to paying me for things.  Please, nobody feel obliged.  And if you want to provide a symbolic, non-financial contribution to this hypothetical project, pitch me your ideas for an ongoing stage series, either down in the comments or over in [the blog's Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org), as long as you can keep it to a single set and a mostly stable cast.  I tossed off the afterlife-agency idea as a joking example, but it has grown on my since I wrote it, so any idea could work...
