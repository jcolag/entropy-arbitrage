## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Power Play

We won't get much out of this episode, unfortunately.

 > **RIKER**: There hasn't been a *Daedalus* class in service...for what?
 >
 > **DATA**: One hundred seventy-two years, sir.

I don't see much use in this line, but it does give us some general historical information that might interest somebody.

 > **DATA**: The USS *Essex* under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago.

Once again, we see that they only get this information if it occurs to them to ask for it, which they rarely do until the last moment, instead of having the computer report on these things as soon as they might become relevant.

Also, though, did somebody *already* take over Data's body?  I'd expect more specifics than "over two centuries," for something as relevant to their jobs as missing colleagues on exactly their path.

 > **DATA**: Shields are holding, sir.

They have seat belts!?  Why do they never use them, then?

 > **DATA**: There are no instruments left of practical value that have not been damaged by our landing, sir.

...Where the heck did that grammar come from?  It sounds like somebody put the script through a blender.

 > **RIKER**: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it!

Good for the alien intelligences not wanting to get too close to Riker...

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf.

The guard on the left, despite the lack of lines, you might recognize as [Patricia Tallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Tallman), a stunt performer who---in a few years---would go on play Lyta Alexander for the majority of competitor **Babylon 5**'s run.

 > **RIKER**: A concussive charge would blow out the security fields. We could go in with phasers on wide beam, stun everybody. Sort it out later.

You can tell the good guys on this show, because they'll look for excuses to commit violence against hostages and dismiss it as collateral damage...

Wait.  This sounds familiar, especially considering that Picard will later talk about how proud the hostages will feel to sacrifice their lives in this incident.  This episode reminds me a *lot* of the story behind the pop psychology "diagnosis" of [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome), which I summarized in the post about [*Suddenly Human*]({% post_url 2023-11-30-suddenly-human %}).  But now I need to wonder if this seemingly mediocre episode has a secret, subversive agenda...although probably not, since nobody has Kristin Enmark's role, interceding to keep both inept sides from getting everybody killed.

 > **TROI**: The crew values Picard's life above all others. Captain Picard, we agree to your proposal.

I believe that we have found the creepiest line in an episode full of them...

 > **TROI**: Welcome, Captain. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Captain Bryce Shumar, of the Federation Starship *Essex*.

The Federation apparently existed more than two hundred years prior to this episode.

 > **WORF**: Sir, they know much about the Essex. If it is the spirit of Captain Shumar.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Then he should be behaving very much better, don't you think? A Starfleet Captain.

I don't know.  We've seen multiple Starfleet captains who tried to set themselves up as dictators of planets over the protestations of natives in the original series only a hundred or so years prior to this series---Tracey in [*The Omega Glory*]({% post_url 2021-01-14-omega %}) and Garth in [*Whom Gods Destroy*]({% post_url 2021-05-20-gods %}), to say nothing to civilians Merik in [*Bread and Circuses*]({% post_url 2021-01-28-bread %}) and Gill in [*Patterns of Force*]({% post_url 2020-12-31-force %})---and Picard hasn't treated people particularly well.  What kind of standard could he possibly hold Shumar to, assuming that Starfleet's standards haven't declined precipitously in two centuries?

 > **O'BRIEN**: I gave you that. In a place called McKinley Park. Green grass. Tall trees.

Presumably, he means the [McKinley Park in Sacramento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Park,_Sacramento), California.

 > **TROI**: Lower the force field.

Impressively, the former hostages go back to lounging, I guess, instead of getting out of there as quickly as possible.

 > **PICARD**: If you each know the officers you inhabit, then you know they're equally ready to give their lives for this ship. Free them now, and I will return you to the moon's surface.

For the record, Picard has threatened to murder hundreds of people, including himself and five people under his protection, because he didn't like the idea of helping prisoners, and never once bothered to ask what their government convicted them of.  I mean, you'll notice that this massive, desperate prison break hasn't done anybody any permanent harm, so one assumes that they didn't commit mass murder.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we don't get much out of this, beyond some sketchy history.

### The Bad

They have actual safety harnesses, but generally refuse to use them.

In hostage situations, people find it acceptable and even sometimes honorable to sacrifice or inflict pain on the hostages if it resolves everything faster.  And as soon as the hostages can leave, they instead relax for a while.

At least among the *Enterprise* crew, they see Picard as more valuable than anybody else's life.

Picard seems to think that Starfleet captains uphold some imposing standard of decency, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Picard once again makes it clear that the Federation values political stability far more than morality, by threatening hundreds of lives to prevent a jailbreak.

## Next

Come back in a week, when the galaxy's most diabolical barrel---yeah, I said it---makes Worf question whether he wants to stay on the show, in *Ethics*.
