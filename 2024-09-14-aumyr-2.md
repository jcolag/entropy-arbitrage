This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **Aumyr**, from the geography of *Laentas* to the geography of *Inkari*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Aumyr**
 * Location:  <https://www.aumyr.world/en/>, <https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting>
 * Released:  2019 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Marco Bertolini](https://github.com/bertolinimarco)
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately sixty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  In-world racism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aumyr

The website describes the project as follows.

 > Aumyr is a fantasy setting for role-playing games, born with the aim of being free, adaptable and ready to be played. It can accommodate many types of systems (d20™, Dungeons & Dragons®, Pathfinder®, Labyrinth Lord, etc...), provided they contain classic fantasy tropes as magic and wizards, elves, dragons, dwarves, warriors and so on. For a campaign set on Aumyr, use the basic rules for your favorite role-playing game. No value is provided typical of some systems such as Armor Class, Skill, Saving Throws, Difficulty Class or other mechanics, so that it is entirely entrusted to the narrator the ability to conduct the session independently.
 >
 > ### The world is yours
 >
 > In these pages you will find only some information about world history, deities and geography: it will be up to you to give life and color to everything else. Aumyr is designed to be used both by Masters who like to schedule their own game sessions, and for those who like to improvise and let themselves be guided by role-play. In the first case you will have several details on the setting, in the second it will be enough for the Master to take what he wants to start playing.

And it then goes on to detail more aspects of the world of Aumyr.

I should note that Bertolini wrote the book in Italian, which---like many languages---I haven't learned.  As such, I'll read this through machine translation, so the usual caveats apply that I may overlook clever turns of phrase or may not see connections that fit together in the original.  You can find a lot of the same material on the website translated to English and French, but because I want to follow a standard ordering---to know where to start and stop posts---and don't know how far the translations have progressed, I'll stick with the book.

## What Works Well?

We get some interesting descriptions of spaces, with enough variation that it doesn't feel like the mass media "one idea per location" approach.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Almost certainly owing to this section covering "regions" that have a systematic template---overview, military, population, religion, history, internal districts, key locations, and tourist-y spots---a lot of it feels extremely skippable.  Of particular note, here, the religion section for maybe too many regions explains that people worship the Five, and maybe details some of the specific temples.  And honestly, at that point, why raise the issue?

Several sections also make a big deal about the importance of meritocracy.  In our world, I feel like we've all learned that the word has no meaning, because its value depends strongly on what you consider *warranting* merit.  And we've all presumably seen many "meritocracies" where the values mostly mean similarity to the existing leadership, even though they might cover it up with examinations and detailed criteria.  Quite a few little oddities slip in along those lines, actually, and I don't know whether the book intends us to take it seriously or to present a problem to solve but no guidance.

## Opportunities

If you visit [Aumyr's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bertolinimarco/aumyr-rpg-setting), you'll find what looks like the entire book in HTML sections, where you can file issues and suggest changes like any other repository.  They also offer an open invitation to join the [Aumyr Discord server](https://discord.gg/HP9bA4Z).

You can also check them out on a number of platforms, including the [Aumyr-it Deviant Art Gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/aumyr-it), though I note that none of the images carries an explicit public license.

## What's Adaptable?

This entire section of the book feels mostly like elements meant for adaptation elsewhere, with ten mostly autonomous regions, each with a shopping list of locations to visit.  If you need waterfalls, magic (or other) schools, temples, crypts, markets, or pretty much anything else, you'll probably find a couple of options.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading the background for **Aumyr**, from the geography of *Laendil* to the *Figli di Hardon* (stop giggling...) organization.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the world?
