This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads *Ardvark the Aardvark*.

![A happy Ard (and Bumpus)](/blog/assets/Ardvark_The_Aardvark_Original.png "I probably should have gone for the one where he (they?) has a snack, but this has the virtue of labeling to avoid confusion...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Ardvark the Aardvark with the Back Leg Named Bumpus, Book One**, *Ardvark Has An Itch*, and (missing) **Ardvark the Aardvark:  Ants on a Log**
 * Location:  <https://web.archive.org/web/20050728115453/http://en.wikibooks.org:80/wiki/Ardvark_the_Aardvark>
 * Released:  2005
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Eric Skiff
 * Medium:  Novella
 * Length:  Approximately three thousand words, plus a missing book
 * Content Advisories:  A tiny amount of fear...and extortion

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Ardvark the Aardvark

As you might guess by the fact that I needed to dive into the Internet Archive to find two out of three stories and abandon the third, information on them doesn't come freely.  However, with a bit of diligence, I managed to turn up an archived copy of [the author's original blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20050107090341/http://www.glitchnyc.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/life/ArdvarkTheAardvark.phblox)---itself released under the terms of CC BY-SA 2.0---describing the idea arising during the installation of Windows XP Service Pack 2.

>  So while I was waiting there in front of Arden's computer, I began to doodle.
>
> I had written her a note explaining that it wouldn't be done until tomorrow morning, and had been to lazy to write out her whole name, just ending up with Ard.
>
> Naturally, after staring at that note and her abbreviated name for another 30 minutes, I doodled an Aardvark. He was a cute little guy with a snout and a smile, and I drew a thought bubble up from him saying "Hee hee.... I'm an ARDvark."
>
> Another 15 minutes passed, and I noticed that I'd misspelled Ardvark, and decided that that would be his proper name. The problem was, I'd already drawn a little arrow to him that said "This is Bumpus"
>
> I amended the doodle to say "This is Bumpus. Not the whole aardvark, just his left leg. He likes eating celery with peanut butter on it, with little raisins on that. He's a vegan Aardvark. See, 2 a's on aardvark, but that's not how Ardvark spells it, that's his proper name. Ardvark the aardvark with the back leg named Bumpus. "
>
> This medium, of course, does it no justice, but after 4 hours of watching progress bars, it was hilarious to me.
>
> I'm picturing a whole book with little drawings of Ardvark the Aardvark, who is constantly talking to his back-left leg happily, even as other, angrier animals are teasing him for it. That, and for the fact that his name is spelled wrong.
>
> "It's not misspelled, it's homonymic!"
>
> Hmm... Maybe I'll merge it with my forthcoming SVG tutorial and make it a [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) book. It'll be my nanowri-draw-mo.

Oh, and following the links around, I also see that Skiff originally posted the books on [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page), which apparently decided that it shouldn't carry new fiction...or something like that.  It then moved to a Wiki Cities (now part of Fandom) page that no longer exists, or didn't rescue *Ants on a Log*.

I think that we've solved one of the big mysteries in this space, though.  Why did the Free Culture movement not take off and crowd out proprietary media?  Because we no longer need to spend hours in front of the computer waiting for Windows XP to update.  It all makes so much more sense now...

## What Works Well?

The book feels well-designed for adaptation.  I could especially see this as the start of a series of animated shorts.

While I'll leave it to experts in the field whether or not the lesson feels like it would fit the age-bracket appropriate for stories like this, the actual lesson in **Book One** seems well-delivered and mostly fits the story...though with one caveat that we'll get to later.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

More to do with the state of affairs than the content that remains, but it seems like we've lost a substantial amount of material, here.  Not only did one of the two books not get archived properly anywhere that I could find, but I noticed this note near the start of the short story.

> See the irritated look on Ardvark's face and the cantankerous limp of Bumpus

Without punctuation, I suspect that the author wrote that as a caption or alt-text for an image, which we no longer have.  And I now remember seeing a reference somewhere to these as illustrated books, and if so, then we no longer have those illustrations except for a couple saved elsewhere out of context, such as what I used for the header image.

More specific to what we do have, some of the writing strikes me as somewhere between awkward and not thought through.  For example, the vervets seem indistinguishable in personality, even though the handful that we meet get relatively distinct descriptions and names.  And similarly, as I alluded to above, the choice of lesson seems strange, considering the explicit setting of Kenya.  Specifically, the vervet school teaches the difference between *there*, *their*, and *they're*---again, surprisingly well---but [Kenya largely uses Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Kenya)[^1], despite the persistence of English as an official language.

[^1]:  Best I can figure, in normal use, about two-thirds of the population uses a Niger-Congo language such as Swahili, which accounts for more than a quarter of the population alone.  Most of the rest uses a Nilo-Saharan language such as Maasai.  And only about five percent of the population uses English, rivalled by the native languages not in the two better-represented families.

## Opportunities

I can't even tell you if the author numbers among the various people on the Internet going by the same name...

## What's Adaptable?

Other than giving vervet monkeys Ancient Greek names---maybe they can trace their heritage back to the [Aether Age]({% post_url 2024-07-20-helios-1 %})...---I don't see anything.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll watch **Obsolete**, an animated short.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book(s)?  Has anybody run across the second book?
