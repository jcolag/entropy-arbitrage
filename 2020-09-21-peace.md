Today is the United Nations' [International Day of Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Peace), calling for an end to war and violence.

Tomorrow is also an equinox---autumnal for the Northern Hemisphere, vernal for the Southern---so plan your daylight hours accordingly...

Anyway, this was a fairly light week as I dealt with some non-code issues and a possible "secret project."  If you want more information on secret projects, you should sign up for [the newsletter](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), which is worth every penny it costs.

## Entropy Arbitrage

As mentioned [last week]({% post_url 2020-09-14-democracy %}), it started to bother me that the search page doesn't auto-focus the entry box.  That should now work, unless you're deliberately working on an outdated or non-production web browser.

As pointed out in [yesterday's post on personal pronouns]({% post_url 2020-09-20-pronoun %}), I also updated the blog's [about page](/blog/about/) to reflect my own pronouns.  That shows up as part of the site's "code," even though it's just text.  If I set the template up correctly, that information should also show in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jcolag).  I try to keep my hands off the actual profile, since it auto-generates the page every night.

## Miniboost

Yes, [**Miniboost**](https://github.com/jcolag/Miniboost) has gotten some attention, though probably not much of actual interest.  It took a couple of tries to get all the libraries up to date.  I updated the documentation, since a few pieces were out of date.  And I added emoji to the buttons to (ideally) make what they do clearer.

## Uxuyu

Similarly, [**Uxuyu**](https://github.com/jcolag/Uxuyu) needed some updated libraries.  It still needs one, but since I can't figure out the dependency tree (and neither can Dependabot), it'll need to keep for a bit.

I also updated the README file a bit, here, but probably not enough.

## Other Library Updates

There's also a (mostly never touched) Rails project that was meant to store copyright renewals.  I update those packages, too, even though I don't *think* that I ever wrote any real code.  I should probably kill the repository, at some point, or figure out how to parse the OCR'd renewals.

## Next

Mostly, just copy [last week]({% post_url 2020-09-14-democracy %})'s upcoming tasks to this week, since this week didn't accomplish much of substance.
