This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) watches **Breakfast at the Bodega**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Breakfast at the Bodega**

 * Content Advisories:  Family arguments, food, theft, fire, smoking, some coarse language

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## What Works Well?

Honestly?  Take fifteen minutes out of your life and go watch this one, because I don't really know where to start.

It has some strong characters, quite a few clever moments, a couple of clever visual compositions, and a fun story with an important back-story[^WTySL_].  And almost all of it feels necessary to the story.

[^WTySL_]:  Recast Basil as a woman (retaining the name) and add some small mystical twist that drives her to reluctantly get involved in her community, and I'd say that we found a Free Culture equivalent to Bryan Fuller, given the sharp writing, the bright colors, and the near-obsessive protagonist who has trouble connecting with people...

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The audio occasionally has some issues.  For at least one line---the father's first line in the earlier apartment scene---I have no idea what it says, after repeating it a few times and cranking up the volume.

It also feels like a couple of plot threads go nowhere or needed closure.  For example, while it doesn't drive the story, it feels like they allude to the mother's fate so often that it wanted some big revelation.

## Opportunities

I suppose that you could check out [Elise](https://www.marinaelise.com/)'s other work, but I don't see anything like an explicit solicitation for money or work.

## What's Adaptable?

We have Morad Deli & Grocery, somewhere in Brooklyn, which I couldn't find mentioned anywhere as a real location.  Likewise, the Proveaux Culinary Institution[^uIpAY] seems original to this film.  As you might guess, *so* many people named Rose have had the idea of using "Rose's Buds" for their flower sales, though.

[^uIpAY]:  I assume that the writer dropped a small joke somewhere in here.  Several semi-famous people have Proveaux as a surname, none chefs, but it also sounds suspiciously like [Provo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo,_Utah), named for a French-Canadian trapper who operated in the area, but not exactly otherwise known for its French influence.

I should also note, though, that the film itself doesn't carry any indication of the Creative Commons license.  It looks like the writer/director releases a lot of her work under a Creative Commons Attribution license on Vimeo, though, so I assume that she didn't do so here accidentally.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll start reading what seems to have the title **AI Future Day**.  We'll split it into two weeks, with next week covering the first five "days" of the story.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the film?
