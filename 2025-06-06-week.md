As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The Republican bill also eliminates a tax credit for energy-efficient home improvements like heat pumps and water heaters. That credit has so far allowed households to save up to $990 each year on their utility bills, but Americans will now miss out on those savings.

I've said many times before that, maybe, when you have a group that idolizes the guy who called "we're from the government and we're here to help" the nine scariest words in the English language and the guy who wanted to shrink government to a size where somebody could drown it in a bathtub, *maybe* we shouldn't elect people from that group to work in government.

I don't pay much attention to Catholicism or any religion, but this little tidbit shows the subtly but powerfully opposition between the cardinals and the political right.  In the lead-up to the election, you couldn't go a few hours without a person-on-the-street news spot with conservatives making a big deal about wanting a Pope from Africa, often with a euphemism like "Black."  Catholics in Africa tend to carry on the legacies of colonialism---how else do you think the Church got a foothold there?---making them more conservative than the rest of the world, especially in their objections to the presence of gender and sexual minorities.

I don't find it coincidental that they found somebody with Black ancestors who, referring to his prior conservative comments, said that "many things have changed" since then...

Again, I don't pay much attention to religion, but I do find it interesting that the church has historically embraced (even canonized) people who many of their people today would prefer to eliminate from society.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw Immigrant Deaths, non-US %}

 > The gruesome workplace accidents killing migrant workers in Saudi Arabia should be a huge red flag for businesses, football fans, and sports associations seeking to partner with FIFA on the 2034 Men‚Äôs World Cup and other Saudi giga-projects.

I feel like we've heard about these alleged "natural deaths" for close to a decade, so it seems like it deserves more attention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How to unmake the world](https://africasacountry.com/2025/05/how-to-unmake-the-world/) from Africa Is a Country

 > When thinking about transformation over time and colonial, postcolonial, and post-apartheid scenarios, the idea of linearity is not so useful because often, part of what we are trying to do is recover relations which are partly located in the past. That is, to move counter to the flow of colonial transformations. There‚Äôs a relationship to time which is about a return or periodically moving backwards through time in order to bring something forward, a circular movement.

These posts can't get too serious...
