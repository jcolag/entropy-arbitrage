As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In the U.S., at least 1 in 4 stillbirths are preventable – and that rate is closer to 50% for stillbirths at term, meaning after 37 weeks of pregnancy. Yet there’s been little movement toward prevention.

Heck of a coincidence that society has managed to turn a tool for saving women's lives into a way to shame and punish them, right?  I mean, people calling themselves centrists keep telling me that we left sexism in the distant past, so coincidence seems like the only option...

As I have said, this doesn't really seem like "my" fight, but (a) defending people engaged in pornography, as long as they don't cross certain lines that the right loves to conflate with everything else, has never gone wrong for anybody, and (b) we need to learn from the activism of right-wing activists, because they *always* show up and get attention, while the rest of society smugly laughs at them as they get results.

As this post goes out, you should have a few days left (extending the term from three to seven) to help me work out a canonical possessive-and-pluralization scheme for the system generating random text that only ever gives you what you want in the most Hellish way possible...

During my childhood, children's media *constantly* hammered the idea that the villains lost, more than any other reason, because they couldn't legitimately stand together for any length of time.  Then, **Spaceballs** came along with the admittedly hilarious line that "evil will always triumph, because good is dumb," and suddenly everything in media changed, apparently not realizing that the Spaceballs lost that fight.

In any case, notice that dynamic in what Doctorow says, and also in how the Trump administration functions, where, as people enter the fold, they endanger more of our lives, and as they break up, they...go on roof-walks to rant.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Because brain health and mitochondrial function are tightly linked, Kurouski believes protecting mitochondria in brain cells could lead to meaningful improvement in brain function after damage from disease, particularly those like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

I always need to remind myself that "can" and "might" in science headlines always translate to soliciting investments, but this does look promising.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [3 reasons Republicans’ redistricting power grab might backfire](https://theconversation.com/3-reasons-republicans-redistricting-power-grab-might-backfire-262553) from The Conversation

 > This phenomenon, commonly referred to as “dummymandering,” has happened before. It even happened in Texas, where Republicans [lost a large handful of poorly drawn state legislative districts](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/07/dallas-county-republican-gerrymander-backfires-2018/) in the Dallas suburbs in 2018, a strong year for Democrats nationwide.

I do have to admit that, while I don't like the "Democrats need to fight back" rhetoric---because we have already seen that it doesn't take much effort for Republicans to flip state houses, when the benefits outweigh the cost, such as giving wide latitude for gerrymandering states that generally oppose their policies---I would get a good laugh out of it if Democratic governors carved out a few extra seats and then Republican power started to collapsed under its own weight as they overextend themselves and turn off voters.  They have, after all, proved that we can't trust them with *any* power.

Let them shoot themselves in their collective foot.
