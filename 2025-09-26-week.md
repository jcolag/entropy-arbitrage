* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

This week, I needed a bit of a break after an exhausting stretch.  If we include time on Twitter as part of my run, I believe that this makes the first time since April 2014[^RiFqrJ] that I didn't post at least a *few* interesting links and quotes.

[^RiFqrJ]:  For the curious, on the seventh of that month, I posted about the [NYPL making public domain maps available](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/453152747752529920/) and cited [Napoleon Buonaparte saying](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/453201052712849408/) that "The world suffers a lot, not because of the violence of bad people, but because of the silence of good people," with the irony noted in the few remaining characters back then that invasions don't really fit his schema.  The linked NYPL blog post still even exists.  It looks like I had the idea fully formed, too, except for adding the top image from the articles starting in 2017.

However, I did manage to get a couple of items out.  You should find me back on track for next week.

## 5:42 PM -- Thu 25 September 2025

I have had versions of this knocking around in the back of my head for years, and decided that my lack of posts this week made a viable occasion to dust it off.

## 8:57 -- Thu 26 September 2025

 > Please excuse Donnie for being late in releasing sex offender files. He was in Miami Beach in the '90s, a different time, with a guy who never dies, even though he killed himself during the nightly security camera change that doesn't happen other nights, who nobody cares about, never a big factor in terms of life. Also, he doesn't draw pictures.

For those who *don't* recognize the format, this borrows heavily from [**Welcome Back, Kotter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_Back,_Kotter), specifically "Juan Luis Pedro Felipo de Huevos Epstein," played by [Robert Hegyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hegyes), who'd routinely bring forged notes implausibly excusing him for latenesses.  In this case, all fragments of the excuse come directly from Trump's statements on the Epstein scandal, except for the nightly security camera change-over that Pam Bondi made up.  I don't really understand why other people haven't made the connection, here...

Again, not otherwise posting this week seemed like a good excuse.
