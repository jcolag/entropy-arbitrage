## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Conundrum

I'll ignore the ill-advised romance subplot.  You can all probably guess how I feel about the idea that Ro would throw herself at Riker...

Oh, I also didn't bother to leave her couple of lines in, but you might recognize Kristin as [Liz Vassey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Vassey), who has shown up in soap operas, science fiction, sitcoms, fantasy drama, police procedurals, and a surprising number of cross-genre pieces...usually to more success than this slop.

 > **TROI**: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a game of intuition.

I...don't know if I believe that.  I mean, if you play an apathetic novice like myself, then you can use guesswork, personality assessment, and flamboyance to work your way through to a win.  But we have "solved" at least the version of chess that we play on Earth, and nobody has indicated that this other game works otherwise.

Also---look, I have almost nothing to do, this week, so I may as well critique the writing---why introduce this chess game if it has *nothing to do with the rest of the story*?  Rather than only using the game to get Data behind the bar for one (repeated) joke, they could have found a clue in the state of the board or made the resolution of the plot about the difference between "ploys and gambits" and "intuition," instead of everybody ignoring their intuition to unquestioningly follow orders.

 > **TROI**: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out of our bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style, as only you can make it.

They've upgraded their day-drinking to gambling as an excuse for day-drinking.

 > **RIKER**: The rules on this ship do not change just because Ro Laren decides they do.

No, but they do seem to change when almost anyone else decides that they do...

 > **PICARD**: No, let's umm...let's begin this with a show of good faith.

Note how he treats *not* shooting at strangers as almost a game.

 > **MACDUFF**: We're a battleship.

See?  I keep telling you all that...

 > **RIKER**: Look, I feel the same way. We all do. But if anything's going to get done.

Oh, now Riker has somebody to lecture about not thinking with their lady-parts.  How lovely for us...

Troi will end the episode explaining that people without memories will probably act in ways that they really want to, so I think that validates my pointing it out here.

 > **RO**: You don't strike me as a man who needs a holodeck to have a good time.

Doesn't he?  He strikes me as *exactly* that kind of person...

 > **RO**: He's in Ten Forward, waiting tables.

Does that *not* fall under operations?

 > **DATA**: Our scientists theorize the Lysians are using an energy wave, either plasma-based or a subspace interference pattern. The weapon severely disrupts a starship's computer system as well as the mental functions of its crew.

Since we don't have much to do with this episode, I should point out that Data, lacking his routine identity, acts like a professional.  He doesn't waste time asking people to define English words or drift off on useless tangents.  The Federation did that to him.

 > **PICARD**: Return fire.

This, I think, shows Picard's reality.  They already pointed out that the ship posed no threat, but he found it worth killing them to remove the mild annoyance.

 > **TROI**: *Ode to Psyche*, by John Keats.

It surprises me that Troi has better taste than the usual "Shakespeare or the 1930s," gifting [an experimental Keats poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Psyche).  People don't even really know Keats *for* that particular poem, which means that she actually needed to dig deeper than picking the most popular work by one of the most popular English poets.

 > **MACDUFF**: Approaching Central Command.

Hey, didn't the aerobics enthusiasts try to sacrifice Wesley to the Central Command in [*Justice*]({% post_url 2022-07-07-justice %})...?  And yet, the episode won an Emmy for the special effects.

 > **PICARD**: I do not fire on defenseless people. Mister Worf open a channel to the Lysians.

I mean...he did exactly that, before, and that seemed consistent with prior episodes.

 > **PICARD**: The Lysians have identified Commander MacDuff as a Satarran, an alien race that's been at war with the Lysians for decades. I have conveyed our deepest regrets to the Lysians over the tragedy of their lost ship and crew.

I feel like this conversation should have happened in front of more people, no?  Surely, most of the crew deserves to know about what happened.  Seriously, compare this episode with [*Clues*]({% post_url 2024-02-08-clues %})---similar name and main plot---where the crew nearly dies, because Picard couldn't bother to explain the situation to the crew.

 > **RIKER**: Well. I'm glad I ran into the two of you. When you have no memory of who you are, or who anybody else is, you find yourself---

Womanizing?  Violating every human resources guideline?  No, wait, he does those things normally.  Apparently, he only wants to have his "terrified, because women might compare notes on him" sorry sitcom moment.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we don't get much out of this episode, beyond a John Keats reference.

### The Bad

The crew continues to gamble and drink on duty.

We also continue to see how the managers go out of their way to harass officers coming from minority backgrounds, suggesting that the ship has strict rules, despite holding nobody else to them.

Picard treats aggression against novel aliens as a parlor game, making a show of extending the mild goodwill of not murdering people, until they become a minor annoyance.

We appear to find out that Data and Picard developed their worst traits through exposure to the Federation, showing far healthier attitudes without their memories.  Riker, less so.  Once they regain their memories, Picard immediately hides all information from the crew.

## Next

Come back in a week, when some members of the crew finally get personalities, in *Power Play*...
