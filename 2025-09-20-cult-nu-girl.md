This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) listens to **Cult of the Nu Girl**.  Before that, though, I hope that everybody has a happy [Software Freedom Day](https://digitalfreedoms.org/en/sfd).

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Cult of the Nu Girl**
 * Location:  <https://reena-tm.bandcamp.com/album/cult-of-the-nu-girl>
 * Released:  2023
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Reena Pang](https://reena-tm.bandcamp.com/)
 * Medium:  Music album
 * Length:  Approximately forty minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Effects of capitalism, fascism, misogyny, and death; one instance of coarse language

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Cult of the Nu Girl

The artist describes herself as follows.

> Reena is a singer-songwriter based in Michigan. With a background in piano and ukulele, she writes evocative lyrical tracks for her expressive voice.
>
> Out in the wild, one can usually find her somewhere in Ypsilanti, hunched over a keyboard or taking the bus to work.

And the album comes with the following description.

> In the near future, an artificial disaster only known as "The Noise" is grinding society to a halt.
>
> The times captivate the strong and pulverize the weak. Corpros rush to engage the remains in extreme rent-seeking. Isolation is a routine cost-saving measure. Green is nowhere to be found.
>
> Three survivors coalesce in the shadows of catastrophe.
>
> *Content Note: Cult of the Nu Girl explores themes of ecofascism, lesbianism, resistance, mortality and spirituality.*
>
> released May 12, 2023
>
> Personal Acknowledgements:  
> Eve: I'm ever grateful for you supporting me through thick and thin. I love you so much. ♥️  
> Thank you Lia, for encouraging me to push my own creative boundaries. This project literally wouldn’t exist without you 💖  
> Lia, Lily, Eve, Renée, Chappy and Rich: for listening to so many mixes in varying states of completion 💙  
> Ellie, Nomi, Vince, Krista, Danger, Collin, and many other beta listeners: thank you!

And there you have it.

## What Works Well?

A few songs genuinely feel like storytelling, and even part of a continuous narrative, with related vivid images and ideas all about coming together to kindle hope and resistance against a damaging world.  I suppose that it shouldn't surprise me, since the album description refers to the near-future disaster that they indeed have in common.  With the "no more sidelines" idea floated in *Bargain*, this feels more cohesive---and relevant---than I might have expected.

Also, perhaps relevant to today, I can't help but find myself impressed that, despite the apocalyptic premise and mourning of losses found throughout the songs, the story focuses on hope, not despair.  People come together.  People fight.  Sometimes they lose, but *Something Grows* in spite of it, perhaps *to* spite it.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The vocals often have a (probably self-conscious) over-processed effect that feels wrong for the situation.  Or rather, sometimes it represents the Noise (*Declaration of War*), but other times it seems to not represent anything (*Tender in the Dark*).

## Opportunities

You can buy the album, as usual, and Bandcamp does have some vague community features that don't seem particularly used for Pang's albums, despite 2025 releases.

## What's Adaptable?

In forty minutes, I feel like we got a better fleshed-out post-Noise world than the worlds of some novels that I've had to spend months slogging through...

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll start reading the stories from the Wikiversity Science Fiction Challenge.  I'd like to give them (and myself) some time to breathe, so we'll split the stories into two groups.  In the group for next week, we'll cover the longest of the stories (released in two parts), *Mnemtronium*.  We'll pick up the rest the following week.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
