In areas that still use the Julian calendar in some respect, tomorrow marks the new year, رأس السنة (Raʾs al-Sanah) in Arabic and also referred to as the Orthodox New Year due to the Julian calendar's association with the Eastern Orthodox (Christian) Church.  I gather that this celebration has lost a lot of the spectacle that has shifted to the Gregorian new year, and has instead become more a family holiday.

On that brief note, on to the projects, though it may look familiar.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

Once again, not much actually happened, here, so don't expect anything exciting in the update.

The code-reformatting continues apace, a little at a time to keep myself committing code, but keeping things as light as possible, to prepare for refactoring the ugliest bits...eventually.

## Next

I have no idea, though the **Morning Dashboard** clean-up takes so little effort in the mornings...
