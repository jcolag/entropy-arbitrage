* Ignore for ToC

This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**, from *The Moon Strikes Once More* to *A Road To A New Life*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Blood of the Ancient Star**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov/bloodstar>
 * Released:  2021
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  [Kerkenov](https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov)
 * Medium:  Novella
 * Length:  Approximately thirty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Slavery, violence, blood

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Blood of the Ancient Star

Sadly, I can't find any more information on the project than this.

 > It's an open source novel you can contribute to.

I can't even find the full name of the author, only a Microsoft Word file and the MIT license.

## What Works Well?

While I can't figure out *why* we have this situation, it only now dawns on me that the story seems to only feature women, which allows for a variety of personalities and relationships.  It seems *odd* that they happen to only meet women in their version of Ancient Greece, sure, but it gets us our female protagonists without needing to "justify" the book's cast.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The book almost seems *bored*, at this point, with---about midway through *A Road to a New Life*---escaping an execution hand-waved as something that happens in fewer than fifty words.  I don't think that we need the literal gory details that we get elsewhere in this section, but I don't really understand why the story would set up the tension of the execution, if it only wanted to tell us to forget about it.  In fact, they luck into a faction of followers to replace their recently deceased.

Maybe related, despite this section having plenty of physical movement and turnover in cast, it feels like the book has lost a lot of momentum.  Maybe it has something to do with the dozens of characters who don't speak, get names, or otherwise do anything but pad the numbers, or the previous observation that many events get brushed off as not worth more than a quick summary.

## Opportunities

The book has a repository on Codeberg, but nobody has touched that repository in three years, and the author doesn't have any other projects that might indicate whether they might have an interest in the solicited contributions.

## What's Adaptable?

Assuming that the new (unnamed) character hasn't misdirected us, we see a bit more of the budding religion and general lore.  Otherwise, I don't think that we've seen anything new.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll finish reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**, from *A New Safe Haven* to *Wisps of the Fallen Star*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
