Slim picking's on holidays for today, but it happens to be the birthday of [Benjamin Banneker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Banneker), one of the free Black men (the son of a freed slave) who are counted among the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He seems to have been an important member of the team that surveyed the District of Columbia, published almanacs, and worked hard for the abolition of slavery.

## Replybrary

This week was almost all work on [**Replybrary**](https://github.com/jcolag/library-twtterbot).  The code now logs issues instead of printing them to the console, important for running on a server.  The keyword searches are now normalized, so that we don't need to worry about case or diacritical marks, using the techniques from [my post on Unicode]({% post_url 2019-12-17-metal-umlauts %}).  And I fixed some embarrassing errors that I *really* should have caught before committing.

## Drakes

I submitted the [pull request](https://github.com/shakna-israel/drakes/pull/1) for **Drakes** after [reading it]({% post_url 2020-10-24-drakes %}) for the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub/).  Milne is "good people" and pointed me at a more recent book that wasn't already on my list of Free Culture content.

## Next

I need to go back to a few projects that have fallen by the wayside.  Potentially, I also want to start re-proof-reading and updating old posts on this blog, since I didn't have a rigorous process when I started writing and it's been a long time since I've looked at things first published almost a year ago.

Another possibility is adding issues to some of these repositories, since I don't want to keep digging through old **Next** sections for ideas I've forgotten.
