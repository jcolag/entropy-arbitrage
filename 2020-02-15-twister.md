There's more detail in [this post]({% post_url 2020-01-04-social-intro %}), but this is one of a series of posts investigating the Free-as-in-Freedom social networks that are available, to see how they compare to the for-profit networks that exploit users.  Each post is an overview of the system I have been and will be working with, along my general impressions.

Feel free to contribute your own findings as I go, either on the same networks or pointers to and descriptions of any networks I may have missed.

Note that I added a specific [socialshowdown tag](/blog/tag/socialmedia/) to easily collect these posts, if you want to easily find the others in the series.

This one is going to be *very* quick.

## Twister

Twister tries to combine the immutability and audit capabilities of blockchains (more precisely, [Distributed Hash Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)) with the ease of download of [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent).

Low-impact cryptocurrency mining occurs to maintain the network, but the coins are only used for to promote posts.

### Getting Started

Like [Scuttlebutt]({% post_url 2020-01-25-scuttlebutt %}), Twister is completely distributed, meaning that you will need to download and install [the Twister application](http://twister.net.co/?page_id=23) for your computer.

Unfortunately, in the year or two since hearing about Twister, I haven't been able to get my hands on a working build.  Building from source didn't go any better, again requiring libraries that don't seem to exist.

### User Experience

I don't have *any* experience, since the client software doesn't seem to want to work on my computer, but I suppose I can point to [this overview](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2226176/opensource-subnet/test-driving-twister--the-nsa-proof-twitter-clone.html) by Bryan Lunduke, who was apparently able to get up and running, but wasn't able to do anything interesting _after_ that.

### Community

If Lunduke's article is accurate, there may not *be* a community to speak of.

If there is, I can't find any way of getting a sense of it's character, other than all the articles taking a stand against the NSA.

### Verdict ðŸ¤·

Sorry, no verdict!  I guess I'll try to remember to check for a usable binary every year or so and post an update if anything changes...
