As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I didn't enjoy the show, but I also don't fit modern *Star Trek*'s demographic of "nostalgic for the 1990s."  While I watched it as it aired, I never loved **TNG** like a lot of people did, and as I rewatch it for [my Thursday blog posts](/blog/tag/startrek) to try to figure out how people actually live in the Federation, I don't see that it has improved with age.  If you love both shows, I have no objection to that.

It goes on from there, but it seems like a waste of space to include it in a blog post.  For anybody allergic to Cohost, for some reason, I have [a copy on Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag/a-whole-mess-picard), too.  Maybe I'll update it for the newsletter, so make sure to sign up.

I've actually wanted to post this *somewhere* for a while, even considering a full Sunday post for it.  Now it lives on Mastodon, where it belongs.  I don't know what I didn't do that in the first place...

These sorts of laws never go well, so I hope that the protests make some progress.

At this point, I feel like the **Times** maintains a bare minimum of actual news to maintain its credibility, so that it can sink deeper and deeper into public relations for authoritarians.

Hashtags:  #AI #ChatGPT #Ethics

This article does overlook one critical idea:  Who *pays* for this "ethical debt" differs dramatically from who pays for technical debt.  When a company takes on technical debt, they "borrow" time from the future, taking an expedient path now that they'll need to put more effort into fixing later.  When a company takes on ethical debt, however, they borrow time from the lives of people affected adversely by their product, which the public needs to put effort into making right.

OK, the original post had an image attacked, but I didn't want to identify anybody for such a silly observation.

Hashtags:  #FreeSpeech #BothSides

I've grown extremely tired of the obsession with making sure that the right-wing can always have its say.  Authoritarians have had literally thousands of years to make their case, and they haven't come up with anything new since the Middle Ages.  While I see no reason to silence them, we also shouldn't coddle them when they feel sad that nobody wants to hear about their theories on gender or whatever.

Notably, someone replied to this post *immediately*, to illustrate the point.  I took one sentence out of the article out of context.  This person picked out "conservatives" and "included," to demand that I explain why I would exclude conservatives.  Why should I or anybody ever take such an "intellectual" movement seriously?

It surprises me that media doesn't notice how much conservatives have started talking about ensuring that people need to work, which sounds suspiciously like forced labor.  Gutting the social safety net makes up a big part of that process.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I don't have much exposure to this world, so it helps to find an occasional article laying out the situation.

This strikes me as interesting, and not only because it gives me some personal hope, since my mind tends to race when I go for walks.
