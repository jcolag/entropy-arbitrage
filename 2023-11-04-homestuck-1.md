This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Homestuck** with Act 1, *The Note Desolation Plays*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Homestuck**
 * Location:  <https://www.homestuck.com/>, <https://homestuck.net/>, <https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/>
 * Released:  2009 -- 2016
 * License:  Public Domain as of 2020
 * Creator:  Andrew Hussie
 * Medium:  Transmedia Web Comic
 * Length:  Over one million words
 * Content Advisories:  Body humor, cartoon violence, guns, some coarse language, misogyny

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Homestuck

The official website describes the comic as follows.

 > Homestuck is a very long webcomic with a quirky style of narration and presentation that makes it look like an old text adventure game—but really, it's just a linear story that you read and watch, barring some of the flash games. People call Homestuck a multimedia masterpiece because it's got musical segments, playable set pieces, cool animations and everything the World Wide Web will allow an artist to put in it.
 >
 > The plot of Homestuck is infamously convoluted but boils down to: four kids who know each other online play a video game together, inadvertently causing the apocalypse. To beat the game, they have to interact with the game world's characters, and with a disgruntled group of internet trolls.

I also note this later description, detailing why the fandom has bothered certain people.

 > Homestuck was an obscure webcomic appealing mainly to Computer Science nerds and Andrew Hussie's previous fan-base until it reached Act 5 Act 1: Hivebent, or The Part With The Trolls, in 2010. The trolls were twelve characters with strong personalities and a simple, recognizable, easily replicable visual template (custom blood colors, horns, zodiac signs on simple clothing).

Anyway, I had never heard of it---or if I did, the name didn't register---until I saw a bunch of people in various online places talking about it.  Investigating, I noticed that someone had built an application to replay the entire series *and* that the copyright at the bottom of the official page reads as follows.

 > Public Domain 2020 -- ∞

Much like [**Green Comet**]({% post_url 2023-06-03-green-comet-1 %}), it would take too long to get through the entire story, so we'll only cover the first two Acts of the story for now, and will maybe return to it at a later date.

## What Works Well?

I got sidelined by the games in the story, because I found them so engrossingly silly.  Extended object permanence gags may not go over well for everyone, but I enjoy them.  Once the main story gets moving, its sense of humor improves, too, I think.

The storytelling also at least seems---I suppose that I'll only know as I read more---interested in a wide variety of topics that it doesn't feel the need to explain to readers.

I also enjoy the admittedly primitive multimedia aspects of the story.

## What Works...Less Well?

The game-play conceit feels either out of place or wasted.  Too often, it feels like a weak preview of the next panel of the comic.  Other times, it feels like we readers should have some ability to make choices, even though none of them go anywhere.

While this comes down to taste, the centering of early coursework computer science as a periodic plot point annoys me.

And I admit that this feels petty, and I understand that it wouldn't have mattered during creation or reading this when Hussie released it, but for such a long work, it feels inexcusable to give the reader (almost) no cues as to where to expect the next act or scene break.  It took a *long* time to get through this first act, and I never had any idea how much longer any given scene would run, making me worry about getting this post out on time.

## Opportunities

Oh, goodness.  I told you that pretty much everybody had seen this except me, right?  The [official page](https://homestuck.net/index.html) notes a [Reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck) and [Discord community](https://discord.gg/homestuck).  Fans have shown up at conventions.  You can download art assets and fan-oriented resources.  Sometimes the creator sells merchandise.

The comic has a robust ecosystem, in other words.

## What's Adaptable?

This section introduces us to the **Sylladex** and its Captchalogue Cards, **Colonel Sassacre's Daunting Text of Magical Frivolity and Practical Japery**, the *Problem Sleuths* franchise, Pesterchum, **Bard Quest**, **The Caper Havers**, **And It Didn't Stop**, other games, some jazz artists, **GameBro** magazine, **SBURB**, the Typheus web browser, the **Grimoire for Summoning the Zoologically Dubious**, and probably more that I've forgotten.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll continue **Homestuck** with the first half of Act 2 *Raise of the Conductor's Baton*, it looks like the first five scenes.

As mentioned previously, by the way, the list of potential works to discuss has run low, so I need to ask for help, again.  If you know of any works---or want to create them---that fit these posts (fictional, narrative, Free Culture, available to the public, and not by creators who we've already discussed), please tell me about them.  Every person who points me to at least one appropriate work with an explanation will receive a free membership on [my {% emoji latte %} Buy Me a Coffee page](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
