This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) ~~starts reading **Homestuck** with Act 1, *The Note Desolation Plays*.~~ apologizes.

## My Sincerest Apologies

It has come to my attention that, in my haste to get posts out the figurative door, I mistook a fan site for **Homestuck**'s official site, and came to the incorrect conclusion that Andrew Hussie and any other parties with an ownership stake in the comic had released it into the public domain.

![The word "sorry" scrawled on a red metal door](/blog/assets/28399865610_a0a40d80d0_o.png "What the door said.")

Seeing that this error renders the three posts effectively copyright infringement and, I suppose, incitement to infringe copyright, I've opted to delete the balance of the posts.  If you still desperately wish to know how I assessed the first two acts of the comic, you can dig through the version history for [this post](https://github.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage/blob/main/2023-11-04-homestuck-1.md).

I apologize to anybody misled by my error, or who looked forward to an unbroken run of Free Culture Book Club posts.

Let these three posts serve as a lesson, though:  Working with Free Culture carries a responsibility to verify everything that you see about a work's license.  Don't take it for granted, if you see a website that seems plausible.  Look for *primary sources*.
