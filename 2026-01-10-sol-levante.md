This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) watches **Sol Levante**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Sol Levante**
 * Location:  <https://opencontent.netflix.com/>, <https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fwatch%2F81017017&sa=D&sntz=1>
 * Released:  2020
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Netflix
 * Medium:  Animated short
 * Length:  Approximately four and a half minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Fantasy violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Sol Levante

Netflix describes the piece as follows.

> We’ve had great success remastering titles like _Knights of Sidonia_, _Flavors of Youth_ and _Godzilla_ from SDR to HDR over the last few years. But what if we increase the resolution and create anime with HDR in mind from conception? Working with Japan's Production I.G, we set out to create the first 4K HDR Atmos anime short and discover what would need to change in anime workflows.

They also published a full [breakdown on the technical requirements](https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-4k-and-hdr-to-anime-at-netflix-with-sol-levante-fa68105067cd), including two behind-the-scenes documentaries (probably not under Free Culture licenses), though I don't see any information on the story, there.

Admittedly, I don't like the idea of directing attention to a half-trillion-dollar media company that epitomizes corporate slop.  However, for such a company to provide so much material for other people to work with under a Free Culture license feels important...and I overlooked it in 2020, when I would've had a kinder assessment of the company.

Actually, maybe I wouldn't have had a kinder assessment.  Early in blogging, in my [2025-in-review]({% post_url 2019-12-29-review-2019 %}) post, I said (no Free Culture sources) that Netflix...

 > ...made its modern brand on niche content free of interference for better ratings, now clinically [cancels shows that don't immediately change subscription numbers](https://screenrant.com/netflix-cancels-shows-three-seasons-why/), while [churning out](https://bgr.com/2017/04/18/netflix-movies-adam-sandler-sandy-wexler/) [uninspiring content](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/netflix-scrotal-recall/) and [underpaying talent](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-11-14/monique-sues-netflix-for-discrimination-in-show-offer).

There you go, then.  I don't like Netflix---and stopped subscribing years ago---but I need to praise good behavior while I condemn the bad.  Yes, they dumped a bunch of shows so that they could feed **Friends** and **Stranger Things**, but they still created a couple of things for other people.

## What Works Well?

First, it seems worth saying, especially in this case, that I like that this exists, and I can't think of anything else in the Free Culture space like it.  As I said, I may not like the company, but making good things helps.

And while I realize that this largely describes the entire point of the project, and as we might expect from a professional production, the four minutes of footage do look beautiful.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I have to admit that I can't really follow the story, here, beyond some vague *magic stuff happens*, and the supplemental material (see below) doesn't have any text descriptions that I could find.  It seems clear that they had a specific narrative in mind that makes sense of the fights, but unless somebody wants to transcribe the images of (I assume, based on the names) Japanese, it feels like we almost jump randomly from the opening ritual to the fights themed around the classical Chinese elements to...some ending.

## Opportunities

You probably can't collaborate with Netflix without some connections and authoritative positioning.  And whereas for an independent work I'd say something like "buy something from them to fund more," it seems clear that Netflix doesn't work that way.  If you have a Netflix subscription, though, maybe watching the short a few times will send a mild signal.

However, with this short film, you can also grab audio tracks, animatics, individual cels---including some partial art designed to compose into a full scene---and probably more that I didn't understand.

## What's Adaptable?

While I need to emphasize again that I couldn't really follow the overall plot, the three segments seem to provide some form of magic that one could adapt, along with the unnamed protagonist.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll start reading **Wuffle**, a web comic.  I guess that we'll split the work into the three year-based archives, with 2012's comics first.  It probably doesn't make any sense to divide it that way, but it'll do at a glance...

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the animation?
