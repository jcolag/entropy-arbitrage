This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **Violent Nemorous Passage**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Violent Nemorous Passage

I don't really know anything about this.  Maybe I learned about it through somebody mentioning it on the Fediverse, or maybe not.  Reading through the site, they mean the adventure to go with the [**Wolden**](https://mottokrosh.com/machinations/wolden/) RPG, which describes itself as follows.

> Wolden is an RPG that is rules-light and flavor-heavy. A single, unified mechanic does all the heavy lifting, paving the way for thrilling forest and powerful folk-magic stories.
>
> A Forest RPG of Wayward Cults
>
> Warning: Contains kick-ass witches and warlocks who care not for your dogma, bigotry, or patriarchy, and primordial creatures of the forest, just as likely to give you ecstatic dreams as bone-shattering nightmares. And that's just the player characters.
>
> Wolden is a new role-playing game from the makers of Hypertellurians. This zine details the rules of the game, and the first two of many cults that call Wolden, the heart of the forest, home, in an uneasy alliance.

And, plus or minus a couple of bulleted lists, you now know what I know, maybe more since a lot of that seems opaque to me.

## What Works Well?

I find it at least amusing, if seemingly irrelevant, how often the adventure makes sure that we know all about the sexy men in the area.  Revolvus the Calm?  Sexy male wizard going around without a shirt.  Queen Thastrea?  Guarded by a dozen oiled-up guards in blindfolds.  Even the toad-folk, we learn that they exhibit severe dimorphism, with humanoid women and enormous horse-like, unintelligent males used for travel...and presumably fertilizing eggs, since the people don't go extinct.  An attractive woman gets mentioned in passing, almost an afterthought, but I can only assume from the prose that your characters don't go on this adventure unless they find themselves strongly attracted to men, with full bachelorette party vibes.  And you know?  We don't get nearly enough of that kind of energy in role-playing games, after decades of the "bachelor party" energy, so this seems fair, even if not intentional...

The adventure also includes a wide scope.  Since it seems to intend the different environments to provide alternative paths for the players, that also means that you get more of a complete setting than a single path would have allowed.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

This has some awkward editing problems.  For example, maybe the main game has opted to use this as an awkward term of art, but I find it highly uncomfortable to refer to a character as "a medusa," when the mythical Medusa had a proper "ethnicity" as a Gorgon.  The term Gorgon even comes up later in the adventure, so somebody involved knew the word.  Similarly, they have the "Gibbous River, so named after the crescent-shaped, misty lake," even though [gibbous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gibbous) refers to literally the *opposite* of crescent-shaped.

Maybe loosely related, the random encounters don't really have anything to do with the plot.  Instead, the text specifically mentions using them for no reason more than occasionally increasing tension.  And while that has its place, it also feels like a huge missed opportunity.

Finally, the description of the adventure seems to cut off at exactly the wrong moment, or maybe forgot about the overall goal.  We never meet the "eye sorceress" that the team needs to escort to the city, nor find out anything about the king's consort who she will secretly replace.  And given that the introduction specifically calls out that switch as the entire point of the exercise, that'll leave a lot of prospective gaming groups at least a bit lost.

## Opportunities

You can buy the main Wolden book on several platforms.  You can also follow the company on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mottokrosh.bsky.social/post/3llu76rhvrc2m) and the [Fediverse](https://social.mottokrosh.com/@mottokrosh/114270186033160763).

## What's Adaptable?

As mentioned, in providing alternative paths for the players from their starting point to the city, this adventure ends up providing more of a regional setting than it might otherwise include.  You'll find a cult, a book of spells, a society of frog-folk, a floating city, mushroom-trees with souls, a flying pyramid-city, and more.  The week-long Festival of Culture would probably have the least work to rework it for another context, though, including its dozen or so attractions.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, as children have started heading back to school, we'll read the *Ardvark the Aardvark* books, or at least the parts that have survived years of policy changes on several websites.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
