## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *star-trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Time's Arrow, part 1

Sure.  Let's go meet Mark Twain.  I give up...

 > Captain's log, stardate 45959.1. The *Enterprise* has been recalled to sector zero-zero-one on a priority mission. All we've been told is that evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth five centuries ago.

I have to tell you, this doesn't *sound* like a "priority mission."  No, really, "show up to my office so that I can tell you about something that *might have* happened in 1524"---the equivalent for today---sounds a lot more like I take you off my holiday card list and lose your phone number.  I don't care if you did find my severed head in a pit, this nonsense can absolutely wait.

Or rather, you tell me about the discovery and let me tell you the priority of looking at it...

 > **SCIENTIST**: Work crews were down here installing seismic regulators when they found some remarkable artifacts.

I have to tell you, Earth seems like a complete mess of crackpot gadgets trying to force nature to act in extremely unnatural ways.  So far, we've visited our home here and in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}), and both times make it sound analogous to a global golf course, where we *like* spending time in nature, but only if we can make it as artificial and sterile as possible...

 > **DATA**: The bifocal vision aid is typical of the era. The weapon is a forty-five caliber double-action cavalry pistol invented by Colt Firearms in 1873.

Notice that Picard jumps for the firearm.

 > **SCIENTIST**: We've confirmed that no one has been in or out of this cavern in centuries, so we're left with a five-hundred-year-old mystery.

How?

No, really, *how* can they have confirmed that nobody gone in or out of a cavern?  Does it have a guest registry or security cameras?

 > **PICARD**: A cellular fossil?

Normally Riker gets these "what does that mean?" lines, and it looks equally inane on Picard to question the meaning of normal words.

 > **DATA**: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I am not that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death.

Again, one of the weirdest aspects of this franchise has to revolve around its weird insistence on death giving meaning or otherwise motivating life.

 > **TROI**: If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay.

Does she even know how that she has a job?

 > **TROI**: How did he put it? As I experience certain sensory input patterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent.
 >
 > **RIKER**: So what's the point?

...That she finds it acceptable to mock her colleagues behind their backs, maybe?  I present to you, the *emotional intelligence* of an empath.

Also, though, what about "become accustomed" confuses Riker in this context?

 > **DATA**: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well, Counselor.

I mentioned this in [*Imaginary Friend*]({% post_url 2024-10-10-imaginary-friend %}), but it really does seem like Data pulls his hyper-pedantic nonsense because everybody else expects it, rather than because he "really" acts that way.

 > **DATA**: Captain, there is no rational justification for this course.

I should note that, the last time that Data had one of these "heart-to-heart talks" with Picard in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}), he *also* needed to point out that the captain treated him like a trinket not worth thinking of as a useful colleague.

 > **TROI**: My God, Will. They're human.

Wait, she can identify people by species based on their emotions, and this never comes up again?

 > **LAFORGE**: But to get a point-zero-zero-four variance, we'd need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator, Data. I don't think we've got one that would come close.
 >
 > **DATA**: Yes, we do.  It is built into my positronic decompiler. It will be necessary for me to join the away team, sir.

Actually, we know that they have a spare, because Data went out of his way to explain that his phase discriminator differs from Lore's, proving the prior owner of the head.

I point this detail out, because you could argue that Data explicitly lied to get in on this action, since he can't *not* know what he said a few scenes ago.

 > **DATA**: But I am capable of performing significant tasks both mental and physical. Perhaps your hotel would offer me a job.

They have a law against interfering with alien cultures, but Data sees no issues with using his inhuman strength to make money to pay for a hotel room that he absolutely doesn't need?

 > **DATA**: Poker?

Sorry to repeat myself, but they have a law against interfering with alien cultures, but Data sees no issues with gambling---probably *cheating* at gambling, since [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}) made it fairly clear that he can't avoid cheating, only intentionally mask it---to clean out people who might need that money to do some historically significant thing?

 > **GAMBLER**: Fold.

You might recognize the bit-player as [Marc Alaimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Alaimo), who previously played Gul Macet in [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}), and will go on to play Gul Dukat on **DS9**.

 > **PICARD**: We cannot make Mister Data our priority.
 >
 > **RIKER**: What is more important than Data?

How do neither of them have anything even resembling an emotional handle on this situation?

Also, they know exactly where to find Data, even though maybe not at the optimal point.

 > **CRUSHER**: What if they're trying to undermine our history for some reason.
 >
 > **WORF**: Some kind of guerilla war?
 >
 > **PICARD**: We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to 19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be. Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with these life forms.

Oh, now that he has a war to look forward to, *now* Picard will "make Mister Data our priority."

 > **CLEMENS**: The eminent scientist Alfred Russell Wallace has revived the theory that Earth is at the center of the stellar universe. This distinguished natural philosopher has reaffirmed our planet as the only habitable globe in the heavens. A world, furthermore, constructed for the sole benefit of man. He's got a lot of folks excited about the notion.

Underneath the prosthetics, you might recognize [Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain) as [Jerry Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Hardin), who popped up a *lot* around this time.

[Alfred Russel Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace) focused mostly on evolution, but I don't doubt that he had mediocre cosmology ideas, too.

 > **DATA**: I am a personal friend.

Does Data...*not* understand how time travel works?

 > **GUINAN**: Ah. Did my father send you here? Because if he did, you must go back and tell him I've not done listening

Since we don't really have much happening in this episode and don't have much episode left, I might as well point out that everybody keeps insisting that Data has almost nothing analogous to him in the galaxy, despite the androids seen in the original series, but Guinan seems to imply that you could find similar androids without much effort.

 > **LAFORGE**: I've modified this tricorder to interface with the subspace generator. It should allow me to control the phase discrimination, assuming this is going to work at all. I need everyone within the field. Adjusting synchronic distortion. Point-zero-zero-one. Point-zero-zero-two. Point-zero-zero-three. Point-zero-zero-four.

Check out Riker's weird panic, as if he had no idea of what he'd see after Data's description.  He seriously does refuse to prepare for missions every single time, even when somebody spoon-feeds him the information.

## Conclusions

We got more out of this than I expected...

### The Good

With other episodes, it seems like Data might want to finally shed his stereotypical and affected personality quirks.  He also calls out Picard, for the second time in the series, for ignoring his position and autonomy, resorting to lying in order to get his work done.

### The Bad

Starfleet has an exceedingly low bar when it comes to defining priorities.

Continuing an idea that we've seen before, it appears that Earth tries to force nature into conforming with human convenience.  And they appear to think that they have monitored every inch of the surface for centuries.

Of all the five-century-old artifacts on display, Picard picks out the weapon for further examination.  Similarly, he only takes an interest in finding a lost colleague after somebody frames it as a possible war for him to fight.

We still see the anti-intellectual strain of the culture, with both Picard and Riker questioning words as if multiple syllables don't count.  They similarly bicker over who loves their colleague more, instead of working to solve their problem.  Even Data seems to have no theory of mind, in the context of time travel, allowing him to understand that people he knows in the future might not also know him in the past.  And Riker also continues to not prepare for missions, acting shocked when it progresses exactly as somebody else described it to him.

The Federation still believes that death gives life meaning.

Therapy still seems like a mess.  Troi all but flees a moment when a colleague needs her support.  She openly mocks another colleague in front of him.  And she does nothing to help with the latter colleague's problem when he solicits her help.

Data seems to have no qualms about interfering with history, taking money from gamblers and offering to use his superhuman strength for money.

## Next

Come back in a week, when we'll ignore this episode's weak cliffhanger to review what we've learned about the Federation in the fifth season.  Then, we'll come back to listen to the writers regale us with factoids from 1890s San Francisco, in part-two of *Time's Arrow*.
