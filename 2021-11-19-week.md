As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In 9th grade, 32% reported electronic harassment, which peaked in 10th grade at 38.8%, declining to 32% in 12th grade.

I'm going to guess that the people who are horrified by the idea of sex education in school would *also* be opposed to teaching children to not abuse the people they're dating...

 > In general, surveillance has a negative impact on students’ ability to act and use analytical reasoning.

This article also digs into the racialized issues, as well, with non-white students more likely to be reliant on technological aids while also being judged more harshly by machine learning systems that only included white students in the training data.

 > They take a holistic approach to their work, which ties secure housing to supporting the individual ambitions and aspirations of their residents, including Mamadou and Abdoulaye.

We generally need to rethink housing.  We currently treat safety and privacy as a matter of social class, and that's not sustainable.

 > She explained in lay terms how child care assistance would help families, how the government could negotiate down drug prices, and how the bill would fund home health care for the nation’s elderly.

I will honestly never understand how this country repeatedly allows the most right-wing voices to set the terms of every debate.  That's especially true with the bills before Congress now, where Republicans have already made it clear that they're going to vote against all of it, but are also going to take credit for them when they pass.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1461696513080446983) [American corporate criminals in the crosshairs (finally)](https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/12/with-a-fountain-pen/#recidivism) from Pluralistic

 > Finally, she's promised to tackle DPAs, vowing to "hold accountable" companies that breach their conditions, with "serious consequences."

People talk about "two systems of justice," contrasting the difference between the treatment of white and non-white offenders by the police and courts.  But the reality is that we have something more like *four* judicial systems, when we think about the distinctions between normal crime, white collar crime, and corporate crime, which *literally* have different systems dealing with them.  When I think about abolishing or reforming the police, a key aspect to me is treating people like corporations, requiring them to compensate victims for damages and putting them on probation.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [4 unexpected places where adults can learn science](https://theconversation.com/4-unexpected-places-where-adults-can-learn-science-169796) from The Conversation

 > Yet nearly 80% of the U.S. population lives within an hour’s drive of a biological field station.

Not quite related, but it strikes me as funny and unfortunate that the [citizen science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) movement---which seems to have largely petered out, for the moment---never really gave any thought to education.
