## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Schisms

Let's jump right into watching the show try to pull off a horror story.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46154.2. The *Enterprise* has entered the Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually dense globular cluster. We are faced with the daunting task of charting this vast region.

[Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amargosa_Valley,_Nevada), (formerly) [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_Junction,_California), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amargosa,_Texas), and [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amargosa,_Brazil) all have places named Amargosa.

Also, note Riker's clock, which shows both the stardate and Earth-like time.

 > **DATA**: Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry reading this afternoon.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I wouldn't miss it for the world.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I can't wait to see what he's come up with.

Could you imagine if any of these people actually *respected* their colleague?  I mean, I don't like the poetry at all, but if I can sit quietly and (pretend to) pay attention while they can't, that seems like a huge problem.

 > **RIKER**: Two, three days. Do you have to hold that thing that close? I'm sorry. I've been on edge all day.

Personally, I'd say "all series," rather than all day, because lashing out at Crusher doesn't seem out of the question for him, but whatever...

 > **LAFORGE**: Well, your poems were clever, Data, and your Haiku was clever, and your sonnet was clever. But did it evoke an emotional response? To be honest, no, I don't think so.

Feel free to disagree, but I feel like even "clever" seems like a huge reach.  The poems that we hear don't do anything interesting with rhyme, meter, diction, or imagery.  I'd argue that, even among the people who have clung to *Ode to Spot* for decades, the poems only work to the extent that you enjoy or feel nostalgic for the performance, here.

In fact, while La Forge suggests that Data prioritize what he wants to say over how he says it, I'd actually argue that Data (the writers) did exactly and *only* that, with little thought given to the presentation beyond forcing the text into the desired form.  It actually reminds me of going to school, where a teacher might assign writing a poem for homework, and gets twenty-odd poems exactly like these, written with the express and exclusive purpose of completing the assignment.

 > **LAFORGE**: And there's no evidence of an EPS explosion.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Sensors seemed to think there was.

This seems like a new step in Riker's refusal to prepare for things, because I see no chance at all that La Forge didn't start the conversation with the sensor readings, but Riker brings it up like he wants to correct the engineer.

 > **MOT**: Ah, Mister Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today? Trim your beard?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **MOT**: Oh no, just a little off the top. I took way too much off last time. I was just telling my colleague, Mister Setti, how thick and luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes I get carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest that you start using a conditioning agent.

This seems like even more racism than we've gotten accustomed to, no?

Mot, by the way, previously showed up in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), where they made a big deal about his great reputation as a barber...but this seems to indicate that he doesn't pay much attention to his work, at least when working on Worf's hair.

 > **RIKER**: Ensign Rager, cartography needs a better position to study cluster FGC thirteen. Bring us about, heading one twenty-three mark four.

This sounds like a new catalog, because I can only find [ghost guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGC-9) and locomotives using those initials as a prefix.

 > **RIKER**: First time navigating through a globular cluster, Ensign? You have got to compensate for gravimetric interference before

The first officer making patronizing comments to one of the few Black women that we've seen on this show?  OK, yeah, that tracks.

 > **RIKER**: No, it wasn't made of wood. It was smoother, more metallic.
 >
 > **TROI**: Computer, make this a metal table.

Notice that everybody else addresses the computer directly, but Riker uses Troi as a go-between.

 > **COMPUTER**: Specify light source.

As usual, the computer almost goes out of its way to frustrate people.

 > **COMPUTER**: They have not been present since twenty-three thirty-two hours.

I must have asked this before, but why does the computer *not* flag it when people vanish?

 > **RIKER**: Other than the tetryon emissions in cargo bay four, our internal sensors haven't recorded anything unusual in the past three days.

It recorded people vanishing, no?  Or does it not bother to even log that?

 > **RIKER**: Ensign Rager and I were lucky to have escaped. Lieutenant Hagler's dead. Whoever it was sent that thing was more than simply curious.

Did the *Enterprise* crew, I wonder, go beyond curiosity when dealing with new forms of life, especially inorganic life?  I feel like the thinking dirt in [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %}) or the nanites in [*Evolution*]({% post_url 2023-05-04-evolution %}) might like to have a word, to say nothing of the Borg.  And while you might argue that the Federation only responded to what they saw as attacks in those cases, I'd counter that we don't know how the aliens interpreted La Forge's scan.

## Conclusions

We don't get much out of this attempt at a horror story.

### The Bad

We see a lot of disrespect between colleagues, this time out, some partially blamed on sleep deprivation, but we also see the same recurring racism and sexism, including using women for emotional labor and saying patronizing things to Black women.  We also see trying to take credit for things that colleagues said.

The computer continues to seem utterly useless, refusing to notify anybody when members of the crew vanish or make the smallest decision about how to present a table.

And, as usual, we see uncomfortable interaction by novel aliens presumed to have hostile intent, despite acting mostly how they act.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Q outs a young woman as another Q for more tests, in *True Q*.
