This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **First Woman**, *Dream to Reality*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Released:  2021

 * Creator:  Brad Gann, Steven List, Brent Donoho, and Kaitlin Reid for NASA and the National Institute of Aerospace
 * Medium:  Comic
 * Length:  Approximately forty pages, or one hour, nine minutes of audio
 * Content Advisories:  Some anxiety and frightening situations

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Dream to Reality

NASA described the comic as follows.

> Dream to Reality follows Callie's trailblazing path as the first woman on the Moon. Callie and her robot sidekick, RT, overcome setbacks, disappointment, and tragedy along the way. From her childhood dreams of space travel to being selected as an astronaut candidate, Callie takes us on her journey to the Moon.

For this post, I read the comic and listened to the [audio version](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/first-woman-issue-no-1-dream-to-reality), but didn't touch any of the augmented/extended reality parts.

I should note that I actually only know that these comics exist, because the Trump administration had the comics removed from NASA's website via his [anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/), which imagines that hiring practices that look beyond white men as candidates, or even acknowledging the existence of other people as this does, amount to "illegal and immoral discrimination programs."  From that perspective, I guess that the executive order did something good, drawing attention to some important content.

And yes, technically we already talked about NASA material with the [**Lost Universe**]({% post_url 2024-05-04-lost-universe %}) role-playing adventure, but this has different creators at an entirely different group within the agency, an offshoot of the [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) rather than the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope).

## What Works Well?

A minor point, but especially after the cover, I appreciate that the artists actually *drew* the backgrounds inside the comic.  Over the years, I've watched professional artists take advantage of government work on the Internet---not an unreasonable thing to do, in general---to borrow public domain space photography for a nominal boost of realism that mostly draws attention to the uncanny valley as the sketched-in space station hangs in front of a photo-realistic Earth, for example.  Here, even though they work at/with the *source* of much of that photography, they wisely keep the Lunar landscape and skies drawn in a consistent style with the characters and technology.

Also, while I thought that I might find it cloying, the comic relief by RT actually sort of got an occasional smile out of me without thinking that it took from the storytelling.  Drawing a firm distinction between his operation and a certain mainstream AI assistant (page 5) especially got to me.

And maybe shockingly, the comic doesn't really pull its punches.

![Page 9, panel 1 of the comic, where a young Callie looks at a computer surrounded by her parents, bemoaning that none of the astronauts at the time look like their family](/blog/assets/first-woman-1-p9-1.png "Can't imagine why Apartheid-era trust-fund babies would find this threatening...")

A book like this could have quickly fallen over into focusing exclusively on the women and/or non-white astronauts, or trying to get by without mentioning race, so I appreciate that the book says it bluntly.

The audio not only dramatizes the comic, but also provides extensive descriptions of both the art and a lot of the rationale *behind* what we see in the art.  It seemed suspicious that the reading would spend an average of over a minute and a half per page, but it actually pays off, given how much more background information and context that we get from the story.  For a great example of that added context, the comic doesn't mention it and I probably never would've recognized [Florida A&M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_A%26M_University) as a [historically Black university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities).

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

For no clear reason other than jumping on the trend, Callie parrots the sort of nonsense that we hear from the LLM-boosters.  She actually insists that her robot will suddenly "have all the answers" if they "let it load as much data as it finds."  And it really feels uncomfortable and more than a bit sleazy to implicitly agitate for letting tech giants scour the Internet for "information," especially in a story that otherwise wants to empower individuals.

Maybe similarly, near the end, we have an awful "you need to do the extremely unsafe thing to save yourself" sequence.  And that seems like maybe not the best example to set for children.  Yeah, disable all the safety mechanisms, because we couldn't bother to plan this mission out in a way that decreased the chances of a crisis.  And they do it *twice*.  I don't want to say that it doesn't sometimes work or become necessary, but glamorizing recklessness feels awful, again especially in this story.

## Opportunities

As mentioned, the Trump administration has, in effect, banned any government work that acknowledges that women and non-white folks---to say nothing about intersectionality---have at least the same qualifications as the white boy dingbats making official policy on unsecured devices and failing to preserve the records.  Therefore, you can probably best support this project by getting these sorts of people out of office and replacing them with people who'll properly fund science and education initiatives.

I know.  Some casual reader or other probably finds it disappointing that I turned to partisan politics for this.  But:

- You can't exactly donate five bucks, fix things in a Forgejo repository, or leave encouraging comments when we live in a world where one political party wants to make the acknowledgement of female astronauts a *debate*, while transferring funding from the public agencies doing this work to private corporations that made "rapid unscheduled disassembly" a household term.
- Free Culture revolves around cooperation, and so has an *inherent* (largely liberal) politics to it.

When that aggressing party stops trying to erase projects like this, *I* can stop talking about opposing them politically to get more work like this.

## What's Adaptable?

Apart from our leads---probably worth mentioning, since society does (probably rightly) make a big deal about astronauts---we have the **Galactic Alpaca** franchise and the Spiders and Gorgons soccer teams.  Likewise for whatever that t-shirt represents, the mustached egg-person with bacon arms floating on cloud; sadly, the audio version doesn't tell us anything about it.  This version of NASA also uses some sort of two-wheeled "PUFFER" rovers to do work.  Oh, and I suppose that they did create the Lunar Outpost that forms the backdrop of all this.

## Coming Attractions

In a week, we'll read the other **First Woman** comic, *Expanding Our Universe*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic and/or audio drama?
