As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > But the thing that‚Äôs most shocking about the Trump ad isn‚Äôt the lies. It‚Äôs how dated it seems, how out of touch. How much it seems to just be rehashing ads that Trump used against Biden and against Hillary Clinton.

It always amazes me how the right-wing both obsesses about everybody seeing them as strong individuals---see their panic of people dismissing them as "weird," for example---but only have fear to fire themselves up.  Regardless of where you go in the world, their type lives in terror of women circulating in society, foreign traditions enhancing people's lives, children having an education to make good decisions, and more.  And it always comes off as sad.

Admittedly, I'd prefer to eliminate the Senate entirely, or fold its membership into the House of Representatives---since we abandoned the idea that state governments appoint Senators, it doesn't serve any real purpose---but yes, as long as the Senate does exist, we need to prevent its members from isolating themselves from their constituents' demographics.

Hashtags:  #USPolitics #Trump #Media

I've said for a while, now, that the "press operas" would rather see Trump elected, because the billionaires at the tops of their various org-charts care more about avoiding paying taxes than they do about the safety of anybody other than straight white men.  Like the police, it doesn't matter than an individual journalist has progressive leanings and tries to do good work; the system won't *let them* do that work, because the systems employing them---hundreds of years old and supported by laws, in the case of policing, decades old and enforced by ensuring that journalists can't reliably work anywhere else, in the other---will always focus on protecting capital from people, usually in the name of "peace" or "order."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A record number of city councils and county commissions tackled prison gerrymandering after the 2020 Census](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2024/07/30/local-2020/) from the Prison Gerrymandering Project

 > In addition, a handful of communities avoid prison gerrymandering by forgoing redistricting altogether, a particularly common practice when a new prison has been built in the area since it last drew new district lines. Communities can maintain equal representation without redistricting if their population outside of the prison has not changed. We‚Äôve discovered a number of p[laces that have chosen not to redistrict](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2013/05/16/excluding-avoiding-redistricting/) because the only significant change in the total Census population is the correctional population.

We see yet another way that the right wants to free itself from needing to do silly things like "campaign on policies that people want" to get in power (and the fight against it).  By counting prison inmates as their citizens, they multiply the voting power of the surrounding community---likely small and heavily conservative, because who else wants to live near a prison?---while reducing the voting power of the families of the incarcerated.

 > It is good that Rabbit has fixed what was a shockingly bad security design‚Äîas [<u>we reported at the time</u>](https://www.404media.co/researchers-prove-rabbit-ai-breach-by-sending-email-to-us-as-admin/), it is not a good security practice to hard code API keys‚Äîwhich are essentially master login tokens to critical services‚Äîdirectly into source code.

I'd like to smugly point out, here, that even in the one-off scripts that I publish that connect to remote services, I keep the API keys in a separate configuration file that I purge before publishing.  If *I* can do it, then surely people who manufacture actual consumer devices for people to use can do it.  Mind you, I also don't take money for alleged carbon-negative cryptocurrencies to (secretly?) fund those projects, so maybe I have more sense than they do...
