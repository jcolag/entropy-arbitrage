As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Yes, this story has less global importance than exploiting fictional assassins to plan pogroms of progressives.  However, Republicans and the media don't take the important stories seriously, but they *do* take this story seriously, meaning that this story makes a significantly better pressure-point.

Mix this with all the contradictions---and thus *conflicts* brewing---in Project 2025, and we have a real chance of pushing these people to destroy each other over the next few years.

 > The working woman, by recognizing her rights, raises her head in pride and gets ready for the struggle. The time of her degradation has passed, she is no longer the slave sold for a few coins, she is no longer the servant of, but the equal to man, his partner, by his being her natural protector, and not her lord and master.

 > Strength at Home is "trauma-informed," says Casey Taft, who created the program as a staff psychologist at the National Center for PTSD in the VA Boston Healthcare System. It aims to help men understand the impact of their emotional wounds, whether stemming from childhood or combat, in a collaborative, empowering manner.

Note that we also learned, last week, that [Trump thinks domestic violence isn't really a crime](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/9/8/2342412/-Shocker-Trump-thinks-domestic-violence-isn-t-really-a-crime), because why would his misogynist, self-absorbed rear end...?

More critically, though, while I support the use of the Duluth Model because it has racked up so many successes, I welcome innovations that do better.  As long as domestic violence goes down, that makes the world better.

 > Despite the lack of money bail, the city has experienced high court appearance rates and low reoffending rates. Between 2019 and 2024, 89% of defendants awaiting trial in the city showed up to their scheduled court appearances â€“ and 90% remained arrest-free. Even among those accused of violent offenses, 98% were not rearrested for violent crimes while on pretrial release.

You already know that Republicans have pushed to put the social safety net in private hands for decades, and to make it as unreliable as possible.  Pensions have become investment plans, for example, and we've seen this push since at least the 1980s.

I have so far not commented on the murder, except through the occasional and strategic boost of a toot.  However, I do have two things to say in almost every situation like this.

First, I don't support murder or ever celebrate anybody's death.  Occasionally, we might have no choice but to resort to violence, but that still represents a failure.  Some of the angriest arguments that I've had with friends came in the wake of Osama bin Laden's assassination, because I don't find *anybody*'s death a good thing, and will not sink to the level of the people who do.  I care about every life, even the ones wasted by their owners on hate, even if I care more about the individuals who don't do that, and focus my attention on the lives that fewer people care about.

Related, though, as with bin Laden, I also fully believe that the world has become safer with Kirk out of it, because he didn't "practice politics" at all.  He practiced *terrorism*, using (the threat of) unlawful violence to achieve political objectives.  Why did he support gun rights?  Why did he "debate" and make "critical" remarks about people's rights?  He wanted people to feel less safe, so that at least some people who disagreed with him would shut up and stay home on election day.  He did this with liberals, not because of open-mindedness, but because his shtick would make no sense if he went to engage with conservatives, because they already live in a world with enemies imagined around every corner.  In my eyes, the Republican calls for violent responses---until they realized that they share philosophy with the killer, then suddenly wanted to talk about ballrooms---recognized that removing Kirk from the equation makes us safer at a time when *they* need to capitalize on fear, as well, because they see their coalition fracturing over tariffs and the Epstein files.

Always remember that the entire conservative project rests on a foundation of belief that they have a "sleeping giant" at their backs, that everybody but a handful of radical weirdos secretly believes as they do.  And so, you'll notice that a lot of their activity centers on trying to lend credibility to that idea, usually by either magnifying their support and/or suppressing opposition.  In their eyes, each of us should worry that nobody really shares our views, and so maybe we should rethink them.  And yet, the last five hundred years has only proven the contrary, as no large cohort materializes for them except in their shadowplay of gerrymandering and disinformation.

I've said this before, but it bears repeating:  The conservative movement acts like a wounded, cornered animal, because it doesn't have much more in it than that.  Its ideas of harming some to help the rest don't work in practice.  They don't have the numbers desperately believing that maybe this time it'll work.  And they compounded their problems by throwing their lot in with physically and psychologically ailing leadership, where they need to pretend to understand complete nonsense.

The movement will die, because it doesn't have a place in a world with alternatives, hence the behavior reflective of the cornered and wounded.  That doesn't mean that they won't hurt many people, like wounded and cornered animals frequently lash out even at attempts to help.  But the current attempts to suppress views that contradict Kirk's hagiography, for example, illustrate that conservative leadership knows more than anybody else that they don't have much time left.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > And what will it take to revive working peopleâ€™s faith in democracy, not just as a philosophical ideal, but as a real, practiced force that will improve their lives?

This gets to the critical issue, which I keep thinking about, that we can't afford to "go back to normal" when we get through this---and in the aggregate, we *will* get through this, because our ideas work better than theirs---because "normal" didn't serve many people well.  We need to move forward to better, as Reconstruction fought to improve on the founding of the country.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The Scandalous Play in Mansfield Park](https://daily.jstor.org/the-scandalous-play-in-mansfield-park/) from JSTOR Daily

 > When the bohemian and button-pushing Thomas Bertram comes to the country homestead from partying in the city, he declares he wants to stage Elizabeth Inchbaldâ€™s Loversâ€™ Vows, a loose translation of August von Kotzebueâ€™s Das Kind der Liebe, with the help of their new neighbors, the attractive and scheming Crawford siblings, Henry and Maria. This is a shockingly scandalous choice for an amateur theater debut. Edmund is roped into the production reluctantly, while Fanny wants nothing at all to do with it.

I need to read **Mansfield Park** soon.  I love Jane Austen for the meta-textual moments like this, but haven't made it through her entire body of work, yet.

 > From before the Revolution onward, physical punishment or even killing were ways to enforce belonging, to mark the boundary between insiders and outsiders, and to decide who had the right to govern.

And again, maybe we should take the opportunity to stamp it out, this time, instead of pretending that only people "over there" deal with these problems.

...But I suppose that we can also afford to wait until the Republicans kill a few more of their own over their personal purity tests.
