As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Completely Unrelated

Because today is [International Workers' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day) (an American holiday that the United States abandoned due to the associations between workers' rights and socialism), after being reminded of it by the team at the [**On the Media**](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm) podcast, I did a little bit of research into [Aaron Copland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Copland)'s 1935 worker anthem *Into the Streets, May First*.  As far as I can tell (checking renewals from late 1962 to early 1964), the song has lapsed into the public domain, assuming that it was ever protected under copyright to begin with.

However, I couldn't find a *rendition* of the song that has been placed under a Free Culture license.  Until I can find one (or, I suppose, ask around and make it happen...), I'm just going to point everybody to **On the Media**'s [acceptable attempt](https://vimeo.com/267689369) at singing an amusingly complicated piece of music.  Enjoy!

Anyway, if you're reading this post on purpose, it's probably not for recommendations from eighty-five years ago, so...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How to Get Your Food from Farms, Not Corporations](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akwxwe/how-to-join-csa-community-supported-agriculture) from VICE

 > A CSA is a direct partnership with a food producer that typically involves paying a lump sum upfront as "shares" to help fund the farm's efforts during the growing season.

And one more...

 > "People can feel connected through all sorts of means. We found that more traditional strategies, like spending time with a friend in person, doesn't necessarily work better for people than nontraditional strategies, like listening to a favorite musician," says Paravati.
