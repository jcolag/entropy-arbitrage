As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...it’s not just that the tech sector is leading capital accumulation — it’s the extreme concentration of capital. A few corporations now represent about 20 percent of market capitalization in the United States and 35 percent of stock market capitalization, compared to about 20 percent in 2010.

I do want to point out---and I always mean to write a full post about this---that even before Trump, we started to see the signs of Silicon Valley's interest in authoritarian governance.  During the Bush administration, then through Obama's, we saw companies systematically attack the Bill of Rights.  The Constitution doesn't bind corporations, but consider that you have probably signed non-disparagement contracts limiting your speech about an employer or vendor, non-compete contracts limiting your freedom of association, terms of use denying you access to systems if you defend yourself from their invasive actions depriving you of "arms," had [software installed on your computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal) without your knowledge or consent, had your files searched, and so on down the line, accustoming people to not "needing" civil liberties, even as they managed more of our lives.  In that sense, why would it surprise anybody that these companies would side with *governments* with the same view of civil liberties?

 > By removing ourselves from a toxic environment, we make it that much harder for those whom we’ve left to hold their ideology whole. As political economist Albert Hirschman argued in “Exit, Voice, and Loyalty,” withdrawing from a dysfunctional group forces those who remain to confront the loss and re-rationalize their position.

I do wish everybody the best of luck as we continue through this season.  In the current political climate, it does interest me significantly that we have people who want people to "debate" them[^dHzSnG], but act wounded when you point out that their position makes no sense, and don't want to hear contrary evidence...

[^dHzSnG]:  Which, yes, debate makes perfect sense for their situation, because it functions as a children's game where you don't need to get anything *right* as long as you score rhetorical points.  Debate also serves as a forum where all positions have the same validity, no matter the actual truth.

One has to imagine that this probably works for housed demographics, too, since it lets people externalize their responsibility for their own health, though starting with younger homeless people makes a lot of sense, too.

 > Trump has shown a tin ear for the problems Americans are facing. He recently bragged about the increased costs his tariffs are adding to consumer goods, touting “record-setting” tariff revenue. Those costs are being passed on to consumers, who aren’t obsessing over oversized golden ballrooms.

Hashtags:  #Trump #Ballroom #Economy

Much as I hate to start rumors, Trump looks nearly dead, and his decline has become clearer for years, so I wonder if somebody "gave" him this project to keep him away from anything important, like asking a toddler to keep track of all the screws when putting something together.

Also, though, have we ever had a clearer political metaphor than an impotent man obsessed with his virility spending all his energy on his enormous ballroom?  A lesser person than myself might ask what he planned to put in there...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/115662386700957760)

 > The true mathematician is always a good deal of an artist, an architect, yes, of a poet. Beyond the real world, though perceptibly connected with it, mathematicians have intellectually created an ideal world, which they attempt to develop into the most perfect of all worlds, and which is being explored in every direction. None has the faintest conception of this world, except he who knows it.

 > In other words, externalizing emotional distress through writing fosters safety. Expressive writing turns pain into a metaphorical book on a shelf, ready to be reopened with intention. It signals the brain, “You don’t need to carry this anymore.”

Hashtags:  #Writing #Psychology #Emotions

In late 2021, I noticed that I found myself constantly surprised at a new week or month, and couldn't really account for anything that I worked on.  As an experiment, I started writing a nightly "diary entry," really a semi-structured text file, and interestingly, it works (similar to what this article describes, stress-wise) in proportion to how seriously I take the process.  If I push myself to handle the day's events from memory, then the memory "sticks" and I feel better.  But if I "phone it in"---looking through recently updated files to figure out what I worked on, checking streaming service histories for what I watched, blowing off the actual comments for the day, and the like---then it doesn't seem useful.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How Public Groceries Can Make Food Affordable Again](https://jacobin.com/2025/11/trump-grocery-prices-public-option/) from Jacobin

 > The private sector created this mess, and it can’t get us out of it. To solve the food affordability crisis, we need to take back control from the giant companies that used the pandemic as an excuse to jack up prices and pad their margins at consumers’ and workers’ expense. The solution is ambitious but simple. It’s time for public groceries.

Granted, this article would've hit harder months ago before Jacobin's favorite New York mayoral candidate made such grocery stores a campaign plank, but still...

 > ILAB and USAID were doing the long-term projects of developing structures and monitoring programs, which freed up the TIP office to work more nimbly. It could tackle acute problems now, like mining camps in northeastern Peru, because it wasn’t focussed on creating the long-term, sustainable change that large development projects hope to achieve. TIP could move quickly to an emerging problem, and through a combination of diplomacy, convening, and seed funding, start an intervention that would be incorporated later on into the slower-moving but deeper institutional approach of traditional development funders. With the latter’s funding and staff cut, that model breaks down.

As I have said many times before, I hate the "Trump 2.0" frame---I actually hate confusing version numbers for sequences in general, but it seems especially inane, here---but this highlights a corner of the government that feels unfairly obscure.

 > In a new study, they show that people who see uncertainty as an opportunity are more positive about social diversity, more supportive of social change, and less likely to vote for right-wing populist parties. In other words, it is possible to influence the assessment of uncertainty in a targeted manner.

I imagine that conservatives have always known this, explaining why they constantly insist that any uncertainty or need for rethinking old ideas will destroy civilization as we know it, an opportunity-free zone.
