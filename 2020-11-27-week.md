As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

After all that boilerplate preamble, though, I ultimately decided to take the holiday week off from pre-planned posting on Twitter.  I announced the [launch of Replybrary <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1331237133089087488) on Tuesday morning, but that was about the extent of things.

Rest assured, though, that I am thankful for my readers, no matter what route you might take to reading what I write.

## Bonus

Even on a holiday week, I might as well uphold the tradition of the extra article.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Trump’s Attacks on Democracy Are Poisoning His Voters’ Minds, New Polls Show](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dpg8d/trumps-attacks-on-democracy-are-poisoning-his-voters-minds-new-polls-show) from VICE News

 > More than half of Republicans said that Trump had "rightfully won" the election, with only 29 percent saying that Biden had rightfully won.

This, of course, has been most of the point of Trump's political career, to undermine trust in the democratic process.  This runs parallel to the general Republican attacks on trust in governance by refusing to govern.  Unfortunately, the work of fixing this country is only just starting, with around a quarter of the population actively hating everything we stand for under the guise of patriotism.
