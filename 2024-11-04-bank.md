While recent and probably attributable to somebody's copyright, tomorrow marks [Bank Transfer Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Transfer_Day) (or at least its anniversary), an activist effort calling for people to move their banking from major banks to credit unions.  And...I don't know, if you read these posts, then you should probably do that, if you haven't.  I mean, I don't like to moralize, but do you want your money in the hands of a consolidating group of enormous companies that have no qualms mistreating you if it can get them a few extra pennies for investors *or* in the hands of a non-profit[^1], member-owned institution that has roots in your community?

[^1]:  In this sense, non-profit means that the organization has a purpose to serve its members, rather than to maximize shareholder value.  Credit unions technically do need to turn a profit to not go bankrupt, but generally minimize that profit if the elected board doesn't have specific investment goals for the surplus.

I don't remember when I switched over, but I prefer it for two reasons.  First, when I need an actual person, they put in far more effort than bankers can justify; about the only way that I can think to improve on the service involves them sending the clerk to me.  And second, even if I only need to interact with an automatic teller, I know that they don't have my money propping up some vulture-capital scheme so that the CEO can get a nicer yacht.

Anyway, on we go to the projects.

## Cohost Export Script

{% github jcolag/cohost-export %}

While I consider the code largely settled---unless somebody wants to contribute ideas based on their archives---I realized that I needed to tweak the README file a bit.  And so, it now has an actual title instead of the ugly repository name.

I wouldn't call it the most critical change, but I wanted to get it in, and didn't have another change where I could slip it in.  If I didn't commit to covering everything in these posts, I'd probably ignore it...

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

I did a bit of work on the page (HTML) headers, cleaning up the `fediverse:author` credit and adding the post tags to the [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) data.  I don't know if the latter actually sees use, but it felt worth completing the set of metadata that the blog presents.

Connected with the Open Graph work, I noticed that Jekyll's metadata handlers didn't provide the `description` tag, or rather provided the site's description, rather than the post's.  Digging into the relevant plugin, it turns out that it looks specifically for a description line in the post's front-matter.  Posts haven't had descriptions, though, but the *teaser* field comes close, so I started renaming what they have to what they need in the structure, so that the build and announcements pick everything up correctly.  I have *only* changed the metadata line's name on current posts, so far.

Visually, a few more domains have link-annotation icons for some clarity, and the GitHub previews now have an explicit size.  The latter should speed up page layout, by letting the browser set aside space in advance.

For the big change, the look of the Codeberg preview cards started to bother me.  I threw it together, so the user/repository title would sometimes wrap to multiple lines, sometimes stay on one line and run off overlapping elements to the right, and so forth.  By contrast, the GitHub cards change the font size of the title based on its length.  HTML and CSS don't have the capability of setting the font size to "whatever makes the text fit in this space," but CSS *does*---as you probably already know---have the ability to set an *image* to whatever size fits in a space, so the plugin creates an inline SVG image with only the required text.  And because the SVG code sits inline, rather than in a separate file, the CSS can style the text in the image, as well, like using the `fill` attribute to change the color when switching to dark mode.

Finally, the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club) tag page has a bit more explanation, particularly explaining why I chose the "book club" term over the alternatives.

## Codeberg Pages

{% codeberg jcolag/pages %}

I didn't do much, here, but---like the Cohost export code, above---I wanted to make the purpose of the repository clearer than (only) a title.

To that end, the README now links to the actual page, and indicates (roughly) what to expect there.

## Next

I want to touch up the Codeberg preview more.  I also might publish code to generate a similar page for Cohost comments as I did for my posts.  Don't expect me to publish the resulting export, because most of the comments don't make any sense without the context, but I floated some ideas in there that I might want to spin into an occasional blog post, so putting it into a readable, searchable state will help.

On top of that, I have some potential ideas for more toys for **The Light's Edge**, and so may start fiddling with that.
