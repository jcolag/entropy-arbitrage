## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Star Trek Generations

As you might recall, we already covered the first act of the film for the [original cast's portion]({% post_url 2022-04-28-generations %}), so we'll jump in as **The Next Generation**'s crew appears.

Oh, and since [**The Next Generation** itself ended]({% post_url 2025-11-20-all-good-things-2 %}), over on **Deep Space Nine**---deep breath, here---O'Brien learns about the Cardassian criminal justice system in *Tribunal*, the crew meets what should have become the franchise's signature metaphor in *The Jem'Hadar*, the station gets its own ship and more information on the Dominion in the two-part *The Search*, Ferengi and Klingon cultures clash in *The House of Quark*, Dax needs to deal with their past in *Equilibrium*, Kira deals with an imposed identity crisis in *Second Skin*, the crew wonders whether you can treat enemy children as people in *The Abandoned*, the crew learns about Cardassian security systems in *Civil Defense*, and Dax falls in love with a nobody in *Meridian*.  It turns out that it takes time to produce a feature-length film.  No, I won't try to summarize the multiple seasons of two shows between this film and the next in two weeks...

It took him *eight years* to get a promotion; I wonder what seems different about his career.  Though I suppose that they didn't make this embarrassing spectacle out of anybody else's promotion.

 > **PICARD**: Number One. That's "retract the plank" not "remove the plank."

 > **RIKER**: Of course, sir. Sorry.

I see that moving to the silver screen hasn't affected Riker's treatment of his colleagues from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Also, the quiet line reading gives the impression that Riker actually didn't know the difference.  As a joke, it only works---to the extent that any of it does---if they have this conversation in loud, theatrical voices.

 > **LAFORGE**: Data. That was not funny.

Agreed, but not for the reasons that they think...

Seriously, they did want us to laugh at the "alien" character portrayed by a Black man, who has told us repeatedly that the Federation treats him like a perpetual outsider, getting this treatment, but not the white woman.  We could dismiss the victim and talk about *who* did this, because the strict hierarchy pervades everything that this crew has done, but Data has almost as much institutional power as Riker does, though he represents a different "perpetual outsider" disadvantaged group.  And maybe both interact, since bigotry often uses protection of white women or [chivalry]({% post_url 2024-03-17-chivalry %}) as its pretext for violence.

 > **PICARD**: Will, just imagine what it was like. No engines. No computers. Just the wind and the sea and the stars to guide you.

No heart transplants, no prosthetic vision aids, not much voluntary diversity, casual violence for entertainment, inbred self-entitlement driving world affairs...

Notably, Picard had almost exactly this conversation with La Forge in [*Elementary, Dear Data*]({% post_url 2022-12-08-dear-data %}), so he seems to genuinely pine for the days when his youthful brawling would've killed him outright, rendering his preference of era moot.  {% emoji shrugging person %}

 > **RIKER**: Bad food, brutal discipline. No women.

And he *had* to make it creepy.

I really need to stress, here, that of the entire senior crew, only Riker would really have any reasonable chance of starring in **Star Trek:  The Colonial Generation**[^3hxlyG].  Picard?  Dead, after bleeding out on a tavern floor.  La Forge?  Blind and probably toiling away in a tobacco-growing labor camp.  Worf?  Either not on Earth if we take his extraterrestrial nature literally or part of some foreign flotilla, since international cooperation doesn't happen much.  Crusher?  No medical degree and almost certainly stranded at home.  Troi?  Equivalent to Crusher.  Data?  Same as Worf.  Yar?  Same as Crusher and Troi minus the credential issues, assuming that she didn't also die from an evil petroleum spill or in her R-rated Dickensian underworld.  Oh, I guess that *Wesley* would make the cut, of all people.  Hooray for child labor, I guess.  All that to say that, reboot this show in the late 1700s to early 1800s, and the cast becomes Will Riker and Wesley Crusher, though they presumably smack Wesley around when he brings up his book-learning.

[^3hxlyG]:  Yes, redundant.  Also, while I've ended up down here to talk about the ridiculousness anyway, in the spirit of full disclosure, well over twenty years ago, I tried to work out a project that I called **Trek 'pon the High Seas**, a Shakespearean *Star Trek* where the characters---borrowed from contemporary fiction (or broad stereotypes) who parallel a character, recontextualized as human where necessary---sail from island utopia to island utopia of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  The Next Generation version of the idea had the ship chartered by...[Jean Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Picard), the ~~stargazer~~ astronomer, because I couldn't ignore such an on-the-nose option, even if not fictional.  I almost certainly didn't get the iambic pentameter right, but I'll make sure that this version of the pre-show doggerel makes it to the December [newsletter](https://https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) (click **...** in the upper-right, then **Follow**) for anybody who wants the laugh...

Riker didn't *need* to make this creepy, in other words.  He could have had a good-natured speech about the value of inclusion (and health care), but no, he decided that he needed to objectify women as valuable to the crew only to the extent that he can---how can I put this delicately?---dock his little *Enterprise*, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: Put it through down here. The best thing about a life at sea was that no one could reach you. This was freedom, Will.

For wealthy, white, heterosexual, cisgender men with no disabilities, who didn't mind stepping on other people for their own advancement, sure, freedom.

 > **TROI**: Here. Take the wheel. Captain, are you all right?

Why do they need somebody to sail a simulated ship?  Do they think that they might lose their way?  Perhaps they might hit some imaginary shoals?  Given where the plot goes, the inability or disinterest in distinguishing fantasy from reality seems like it should have some relevance, but...nah.

 > **PICARD**: Stand down from red alert. Number One...will you begin an investigation? I'll be in my ready room.

Maybe if he didn't bottle up his emotions all the time, he wouldn't almost collapse under this relatively minor stress.  No?  We still don't do those sorts of lessons?  Never mind, then.

 > **SORAN**: Soran. Doctor Tolian Soran.

You already know this from the [first **Generations** post]({% post_url 2022-04-28-generations %}) if not sooner, but you probably recognize Soran because [Malcolm McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell) plays him, tooling around media from **A Clockwork Orange** to **Mozart in the Jungle**.

 > **LAFORGE**: Data, whatever possessed you to push her in the water in the first place?

Wait, did they actually hold off on having this conversation until after the emergency?  Actually, no, they opted out of this emergency to have the conversation, which...that still marks an improvement, I guess.

 > **DATA**: That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more human, to grow beyond my original programming. Still I am still unable to grasp such a basic concept as humor. This emotion chip may be the only answer. Geordi?

I need to point out two major issues, here.

First, adding a chip feels like growing beyond original programming only in the most literal sense of adding new explicit programming.  We've seen this kind of idea from Data, who thought that a beard or gray hair dye---in [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}) and [*All Good Things...*]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}), in turn---would gain him the respect of his peers, so another superficial fix for another social problem makes sense.

Second, what kind of weirdo considers humor a "basic" concept?  No two people find exactly the same things funny, and nobody has a (working) algorithm for creating jokes.  And in that frame, Data does "understand humor," in that he understands that people tell jokes, and sometimes they don't land.  He seems to mean that he expects to become an instant expert in telling jokes.  Notably, though, La Forge seems to either not understand humor, himself, or gaslights Data into believing that humor works in mechanical ways, such as his too-old assessment of Data's attempt at a joke in [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %}).

 > **PICARD**: This could signify a new Romulan threat in this sector. Inform Starfleet Command.

Again, two things.

First, yeah, they found a Romulan corpse, therefore the Romulans must want to invade, because losing fire-fights with scientists at space telescopes *totally* makes sense as an invasion beachhead, and doesn't sound paranoid at all.

Second, why has Picard not changed his uniform?

 > **RIKER**: You want me to contact Starfleet?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Is there a problem?

Other than the ambulatory problem that you assigned to contact Starfleet, you mean...?

 > **DATA**: Yes. I hate this! It is revolting!

And yet, they chose to make us sit through...oh, they mean the *drink*, not the tedious scene.

 > **DATA**: It appears to be magnetically sealed. I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo. Open sesame. You could say I have a...magnetic personality. Ha-ha-ha! Humor, I love it!

And somehow this *passes* for humor.  I officially regret every decision in my life that has led me to this point.  Eighty more minutes of this slop.

As I mentioned in the first post, I remember defending this movie to someone who suggested that they didn't write any of it for non-fans.  And...yeah, did I ever make the wrong call, there...

 > **PICARD**: Oh, it's just family matters. You never met my brother and his wife, did you?

We did, in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}).

Also, why **would** she have met them?  Sorry, I forgot that almost everybody else in the crew has had multiple episodes for their family members to wander around the ship, *and* that we had that weird run where it looked like the two of them might have dated.

 > **PICARD**: Robert and René, they're...burned to death in a fire.

This passes for character development, I guess, killing his entire family off-screen[^25gjv8] so that he can finally mourn *something* instead of waving it off.

[^25gjv8]:  Not that I want to actually see them die in a fire, but we only met them once, and then the series gave no indication that Picard stayed in touch with them until now.  Also, notice that Marie---the wife, whose name I needed to look up while I snagged the reference for the prior post---apparently withered away while this happened, because who could ever care about a woman, not a blood relative, who probably won't sleep with him...?

 > **PICARD**: That's all right, Counselor. These things happen.
 >
 > **TROI**: Captain, it's not all right.

Look at her, almost doing her job...

 > **PICARD**: I can't help keep thinking about all the experiences that René is not going to have. Not going to Academy, reading books and listening to music, falling in love. Building a life. Well, it's not going to happen now.

In two lines, the kid went from wanting to *see* the Academy to, based on Picard's phrasing, joining Starfleet, the more important part of his life than reading books, listening to music, and falling in love.

 > **TROI**: I didn't realize he meant so much to you.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I'd come to feel that René was as close as I would get to having a child of my own.

...Didn't he say the same thing about Jason from [*Bloodlines*]({% post_url 2025-10-23-bloodlines %})?  Did he also die in a fire, and the writers didn't even care enough to tell us about that one...?  Actually, bringing that episode up, Picard indicated there that his rift with his family started with his wanting to join Starfleet instead of running the family business.  That makes me wonder if René's interest in the Academy actually drives Picard seeing him as his, the one member of the family not condemning him for his career.

 > **PICARD**: Right. Oh, from being a small child, I can remember being told about the family line. The Picard who fought at Trafalgar. The Picard who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry. The Picards who settled the first Martian colony. When Robert married and had a son, I---

The [Battle of Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar) occurred as part of Napoleon's big plan to conquer Britain.  This could've served as a sly callback to Picard's insistence that sailing circa 1800 would mean freedom, but nah, he doesn't even seem to care which side his ancestor fought for.

The [Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Chemistry) didn't get awarded in eight years (so far), suggesting that the relevant Picard won in 1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940, 1941, or 1942, rather than bumping a more worthy project off the list.

And, especially as you consider the current loudest voice for colonizing Mars, you'll notice how much this story reinforces Picard's privilege.  Everybody in his family for six hundred years has had access to fame.

 > **B'ETOR**: You've done it, Soran. Wait! I hope for your sake you were initiating a mating ritual.

You remember she and her sister from [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-02-redemption %}), right?

 > **PICARD**: Guinan. It is very important that you tell me everything that you know. We think that Soran has developed a weapon, a terrible weapon. One that might even give him enough power to destroy---

I hinted at this a couple of years ago, but did Picard kick off the sequence of events that led us here?  In [*Captain's Holiday*]({% post_url 2023-09-07-captain-s-holiday %}), we found that Picard had carefully studied the legend of an ancient weapon that could do the same stop-all-fusion-in-a-star thing, which subsequently fell into his lap.  Picard then used (claimed to use) the *transporter* to "destroy" the weapon with a tiny explosion, not a thing that really happens elsewhere.

We have seen that captains of this era have a habit of coincidentally showing up to stumble across legendary weapons---think [*The Arsenal of Freedom*]({% post_url 2022-10-06-arsenal-freedom %}) and [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %})---and seemingly claim them for Starfleet, assuming that they don't destroy them in the attempt.

Now, a few years later, we have a technology in its infancy laundered through the Romulans, which does the same thing.  Did Picard use that squib to cover stealing the important historical artifact?  It would certainly make the story work better, if Soran now uses a weapon that can only exist because Picard only pretended to destroy it, a darker parallel to Soran only still around because Kirk helped orchestrate his rescue from the Nexus.  But it would've also made the story work better if the multiple references to the colonial era connected, or if we had any prior reason to believe that he cared about his family.

 > Captains log, stardate 48632.4. Doctor Crusher has informed me that Data's emotion chip has been fused into his neural net and cannot be removed. However, she believes he is fit for duty, so I have asked him to join me in Stellar Cartography.

Yeah, blame the writing on the *doctor*, a people-doctor, even, not even a script-doctor.  They totally don't want to subject us to the emotion chip subplot (again), but Crusher insisted on it...

 > **PICARD**: Wait. The *Bozeman*. Why would it make a course correction?

The *Bozeman* showed up in [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}).

 > **DATA**: The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout this sector. As a result any ship passing through this region would have to make a minor course correction.

I feel the need to point out that, when Picard said to list all effects, Data chose to prioritize "minor course correction by some ship" over "gravity has shifted significantly."

 > **DATA**: Veridian Three is uninhabited. However, Veridian Four supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

Sounds like their version of the Prime Directive applies, to me.  They need to let Soran do what he wants, because stopping him would interfere with the natural development of the pre-industrial society.  After all, [*Emergence*]({% post_url 2025-10-30-emergence %}) that some kinds of creatures have a fixed purpose, such as death, and we should accept that quietly...

Anyway, we'll stop here for the week, and pick things up in the next scene, after Picard gives the order to go.

## Conclusions

I suppose that we got more out of this half of the film than I expected.

### The Bad

We see more hints that non-humans have more trouble with career advancement.  And we also see such people subject to abuse by authority figures, which they see as funny, but seemingly only when a human hurts or embarrasses a non-human.

Speaking of the role-reversal, they still see no issues with Data wasting everybody's time.  It offends them for him to have embarrassed a white woman, but they don't find his attempt at a joke at somebody else's expense troubling.  They indulge the whole emotion chip nonsense, until it puts somebody in danger.  And he seems happy to consider a ship making a small change more interesting than the gravitational changes across the region that caused it.

Many wish that they lived in the days of monarchy, slavery, and little medical help, because they don't like computers helping them navigate.  To the extent that others disagree, they do on the basis that they can't objectify the opposite sex.

We have several scenes showing us that they don't or can't deal with grief in a healthy way, and it doesn't go well for them.

They still see Romulan plots around every corner, even when all evidence points to them as the victims in a situation.  People also seem to see a desire to join Starfleet as inherently important.

Picard, at least, seems to have bizarre ideas of family, almost laying claim to a nephew who might eventually have a similar interest to him.  And this continues to hint that Picard comes from an extremely wealthy background.



### The Weird

They seem to think that they need somebody to steer their holographic toy ships while they play sailor.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we kill everybody but still somehow make us sit through two meals, in the second half of (and third post for) **Generations**.
