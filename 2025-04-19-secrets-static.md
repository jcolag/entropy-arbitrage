This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads through **Secrets in the Static**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Secrets in the Static: The Ghost Town of Wavelength**
 * Location:  <https://thoughtpunks.com/secrets-in-the-static-the-ghost-town-of-wavelength/>
 * Released:  2025
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  [Thought Punks](https://thoughtpunks.com/)
 * Medium:  Role-playing game
 * Length:  Approximately five thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  I didn't really see anything

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Secrets in the Static

The game describes itself as follows.

 > A TTRPG idea inspired by Lynchian horror, embodying surreal suburban dread and the unsettling blend of media and reality. Pulled from my playtesting slush pile in memory of David Lynch. Shared under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 license. Credit “Rev from Thought Punks”. This was a beta playtest module. The formatting and presentation style reflects that. This also stands out as an example of [minimalist world-building](https://thoughtpunks.com/crafting-minimalist-settings-for-tabletop-roleplaying-games/).

That doesn't particularly inspire confidence for me, but they released it on the heels of [Lynch's passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch), and if we hadn't recently discussed a role-playing game---[**Cairn**]({% post_url 2025-02-08-cairn-1 %})---at that time and another planned soon, I probably would've joined in the tribute.

Oh, also note that the team originally released this under the similar name **Echoes in the Static**, so if you see that name floating around, it probably refers to this.

## What Works Well?

Taking away the surface trappings---announcing the world's alleged inspiration and the peculiar connection to an era that I'll explain later---this actually feels like a fun setting.  I don't know if it would definitely work as a game, since even the text states (see *Collaboration and Mystery*) that characters should have conflicting memories, which wouldn't work well around a gaming table.  As a setting for scripted media, though, it could probably work fairly well.

To the game's credit, I think that a lot of people will also appreciate that it maps out the entire campaign arc, with mostly three large acts and a variety of approaches to dealing with the central issue.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Given the premise, it feels like a bizarre choice to have the town "trapped" in the early 1990s.  Lynch's career spanned almost sixty years, and his works most identified with the 1990s only give that impression from of our memories watching them, since they tried to mostly seem timeless.  Maybe they chose the era as when we still lived in a literal broadcast media landscape, television and radio primarily over the air, but even that feels unnecessary, when the Signal could plausibly come from any device.  The text calls out "quaint diners, artisanal crafts, and warm neighbors," but none of those feel anchored in the era, either.

It also seems awkward that the text starts talking about the lowercase-s *signal*, then never uses the term again and replaces it with capital-S *Static*...and then becomes the *signal* again near the end.  I realize that they probably hacked together a lot of this at the last minute as a David Lynch tribute when he passed away, and the project may not even have started as this project, but it does raise questions like whether those terms should mean distinct things, somehow.

## Opportunities

They ran a [crowdfunding campaign](https://crowdfundr.com/32VFe7?ref=ab_7oVhSvGNW2J7oVhSvGNW2J) that appears to have ended, so one imagines that you can probably soon buy a copy of the larger game.  I can't help noticing, though, that the campaign material doesn't say anything about maintaining the public license.

## What's Adaptable?

The forgotten town of Wavelength, set in upstate New York, seems like the biggest, though the admittedly vague signal/Static could also move pretty much anywhere.

## Coming Attractions

For the next few weeks, we'll start reading **pilogy**, I guess they call it, a novel about a fictional computer science club.  Breaking it into four posts, we'll start next week with the beginning through _e^(6pi*i/5)_.  If you reach _e^(8pi*i/5)_, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game's setting?
