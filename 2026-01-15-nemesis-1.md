## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Nemesis

Since last time, **Deep Space Nine** and **Voyager** both wrapped up their stories, making this film the then-latest event capping their era.  Less important for our context, in *our* world, **Enterprise** came close to the middle of its second season.

And, as with [**Insurrection**]({% post_url 2026-01-01-insurrection-1 %}), I go into this never having seen the film.  I do know a *bit* of the story because a writer marked up a leaked script at the time with snide---and probably offensive, given the culture of 2002's Internet---commentary as PDF comments.  But I also haven't seen *that* in over twenty years, and have no idea if it started with an actual script.

I guess that we'll skip most of the Romulan-specific material---I gladly leave it to somebody else to figure out what we can glean about Romulan culture---plus the hilariously bad "oops, all serifs" titles.

 > **PICARD**: Duty. A starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty. I have commanded men in battle. I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies. I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species, but none of this compares to my solemn duty today as...best man. Now, I know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union. But have you two considered what you are doing to me? Of course, you're happy, but what about my needs? This is all a damned inconvenience, and while you're happily settling in on the *Titan*, I will be training my new first officer. You all know him. He's a tyrannical martinet who'll never, ever allow me to go on away missions!

O frabjous day, callooh, callay, I guess.  We get to suck some momentum out of what almost looked like an interesting plot for mediocre delivery of stale jokes[^z0SkpQ].  Crisis averted. {% emoji face exhaling %}

[^z0SkpQ]:  This whole scene really reminds me a lot of a less-adept attempt at aping the Muppet version of [**The Frog Prince**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince_%281971_film%29), which has the running joke of the king (Jim Henson) giving speeches with his assistant quietly giving the rabble directions on how to react, such as "large cheer" or "polite laughter...oh, building to riotous applause," because the king doesn't have their attention otherwise.  Unless Picard later needs to "bake the hall in the candle of her brain," though, I assume that they accidentally stumbled on the vibe.

This also seems like the worst best man speech.  Nobody shows up to the reception to hear more about the best man's anxieties.  They show up (for the open bar, yeah, but also) to have a laugh at the groom's expense, and in many circles, to hear some horrible secret that will probably corrode the marriage, exactly the sort of thing that you'd expect from these backbiting weirdos.  I don't *recommend* that move, but you know that they all want to hear about the time in [*11001001*]({% post_url 2022-08-25-11001001 %}) when Picard walked in on Riker trying to seduce a hologram...

 > **DATA**: That is the regulation, sir. Starfleet Code section twelve, paragraph four...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Data!
 >
 > **DATA**: Sir?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Shut up.

Once again, Picard sets Data up specifically so that he can cut his "friend" off.

 > **PICARD**: Fifteen years I've been waiting to say that!

Did I hallucinate all the times that I heard him say it before?

 > **WORF**: Romulan ale should be illegal.

Seriously, what do these films have against Worf, other than the blatant racism?

 > **TROI**: That was a lovely toast.

And we still need to massage his ego, I guess.

 > **RIKER**: No, no speeches and no clothes.

Can he not be creepy about even one thing?

 > **DATA**: Ladies and Gentlemen and invited transgendered species. In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift. Given Commander Riker's affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift, in honor of their conjugation. {% emoji musical notes %} Never saw the sun shining so bright. Never saw things going so right. Noticing the days hurrying by. When you're in love, my how they fly. Oh, blue skies, smiling at me... {% emoji musical notes %}

First, let's try to ignore the ugly past-tense of an adjective and consider that they seem to think that gender expression (and fixing it) applies to an entire species, *and* that they apparently invited at least one entire species to the event[^29_xZy].

[^29_xZy]:  Full disclosure, at the one wedding that I officiated, I went with "family, friends, workers, and anybody who might have wandered in accidentally," specifically to avoid this sort of problem.

Now, as to the term itself, we often find it deployed as a slur, so don't *actually* ignore or forgive it, especially since it delivers like the worst grudging acknowledgement that other people exist.  And the phrasing classifies transgender folks as "other," not only by separating them into an entirely separate species, but in separating them from "ladies and gentlement."  In other words, having undercut the momentum of the story with this, it now wants to get things moving again with outright bigotry thinly disguised as respect for diversity.

Then, given how much 1930s nonsense that they have all subjected them to, I refuse to believe that anybody there considers 1926's [*Blue Skies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Skies_%28Irving_Berlin_song%29)---written to replace a Rogers and Hart song for the far less famous **Betsy**---remotely archaic, given that Benny Goodman's 1935 version often feels definitive.

Also, did we really need *two* films prominently featuring the song-stylings of Data?  Actually, since the film's release, the copyright on the song *and* its use in one of the first "talkies" **The Jazz Singer** a year later have both expired, so let's blot this nonsense out with Al Jolson[^ZD19p3] hamming it up over the same song.

[^ZD19p3]:  I should note that Jolson has a highly mixed legacy, to say the least.  You could make a fair case that he misappropriated Black culture and stereotypes---including Blackface, at times---to make a name for himself, *but* contemporary Black-run publications also generally liked his work and saw him as something of an ally.  He also seems to have at least tried to live up to that by lifting up Black performers and productions, even traveling across the country to take Black performers to dinner when local establishments denied them service.  And it seems worth having that conversation, because fans should consider comparing that track record to Data, a character mired in misappropriation of East Asian stereotypes, even wearing yellow-face in a painfully literal sense, but with nobody involved in the character's creation advocating for Asian or---as a different demographic has seen those stereotypes as indicating them---autistic performers.

Apparently, they ad libbed the dialogue, and still somehow came up with something less offensive in 1927 than this franchise could manage in 2002 with writers and editors...

 > **WORF**: Irving Berlin...

Yeah, of everything going on, here---eight and a half minutes in, by the way, admittedly not as obnoxious as [**Insurrection**]({% post_url 2026-01-01-insurrection-1 %})'s opening---let's blame American treasure [Irving Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin).  And since it never occurred to me until I linked to his name, it seems worth mentioning that Berlin died during **The Next Generation**'s run, making him much more human and tangible than he probably seems today.

 > **TROI**: It's tradition, Worf! You of all people should appreciate that.

Didn't they get transferred?

 > **WORF**: I will not do it!

Didn't *he* get transferred?  Does nobody have anything better to do?  At this point, it looks like they hijacked a war-ship to serve as their party bus from one wedding reception to the next.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, come now! A big, handsome, strapping fellow like you? What can you be afraid of?

More laughing at Worf's masculinity.  Please stop...

 > **PICARD**: What sort of signature?
 >
 > **WORF**: Positronic.

Huh?

OK, much as I'd rather avoid fictional technology discussions, here, this weird me out too much to stay silent.  While positronic things don't actually exist, the construction of the term leads one to believe that they would work like electronic devices, but with [positrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron) running down the wires[^sm1iur] instead of their positive-matter electron counterparts.  Carl Anderson had only discovered the positron (theorized a few years earlier by Paul Dirac) in 1932, so it had the cultural currency to Pulp science fiction writers that dark matter did for writers in 2000--2010 or so.

[^sm1iur]:  Technically, the "holes" run down the wires, spaces where the mobile electrons (or positrons) can jump from atom to atom.  For a variety of reasons, individual electrons move so slow down a wire that most people can walk faster, whereas the empty spaces shift along propagating signals near the speed of light.  Nobody cares, I realize, but I'd feel guilty not making that distinction after so many years working with electrical engineers...

Anyway, I bring this up, because a "positronic signal" detected from space makes exactly as much sense as an "electronic signal."

 > **RIKER**: Captain, diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

Oh, no, that has always gone...well, entirely fine, I think, right?  I suppose that it went less-fine in [*The Defector*]({% post_url 2023-07-06-defector %}), but Picard mostly did that to himself, as I recall, with the script even calling out Custer's Last Stand as a seeming allegorical inspiration for his bigotry and paranoia.

 > **PICARD**: ...where we will all honor the Betazoid tradition. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in the gym.

I need to point out the difference in how they treat insecurity, here.  If Worf feels insecure about his body, they all harass him.  When Picard feels insecure about his body, though, everybody accepts that he'll take time off work to go improve his body in twenty minutes.

 > **PICARD**: You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

Oh..."snap," I guess?  People said that in 2002, right?

We should see this as insulting, because it implies that Riker's identity will get muted by his wife's, because---ha, maybe---that only happens to *women*. {% emoji person facepalming %}

I don't really know how their "evolved" future became even more sexist than 2002, but there you go.

 > **DATA**: I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities. Over that rise, sir, half a kilometer. The radiant electromagnetic field is interfering with my tricorder, but we are within a few meters of the signal.

For reference, [**All Good Things...**]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}) gave us some hovercraft thing in London, but somehow Starfleet has opted for discount-[Speed Buggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Buggy) to solve mysteries.  This serves the dual purposes of giving the franchise some toyetic garbage to hawk at a rapidly fleeing audience that at this point probably no longer included children, and making sure that we kick off the adventure again trying to mold Picard into a virile action hero tearing up the wilderness---on an inhabited, pre-industrial world, remember, because it apparently has nothing to do with the story---with his carless driving.

 > **WORF**: Very astute!

I find this scene disproportionately funny both because, as usual, Michael Dorn nails the line far better than any of Picard's "witticisms," and because they somehow decided to leave in the footage of the arm flailing around trying to find Worf's ankle for a few seconds.

 > **PICARD**: This doesn't feel right.

I know, fifteen minutes in, and...oh, he probably doesn't mean watching this slop.  Actually, I have no idea what he means, because we have already moved on from this vague sense of unease.

 > **DATA**: This is not the appropriate time for a conversation.
 >
 > **B-4 HEAD**: Why?

Oh, yes, everybody has missed the irritating "waste everybody's time to save himself a couple of seconds" Data thing, so let's introduce a new character to do only that, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: Bee-four? Doctor Soong's penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end.

I mean...three.  The end came at three, because he named the fourth after his girlfriend to transfer the identity, as we saw in [*Inheritance*]({% post_url 2025-07-31-inheritance %}).

Really, though, given how often that they've had to go to planet Kappa-Six or whatever, what makes him think that he went with B-4 as a homonym of "before"?  For all Picard knows, the name refers to the fourth iteration on the second design, and happened to get lost on the planet.  If he had an information-related name, then I could understand the idea of a whimsical theme.  For example, calling the prototype *Dope* would make sense of the line, implying both an early revision likely to not work and---referring to "the straight dope"---fitting neatly with Data and Lore.

 > **PICARD**: Number One, keep me informed, and Geordi reassemble him.

Yes, do that, because exactly this action in exactly this situation went *so* well for them in [*Datalore*]({% post_url 2022-08-11-datalore %}), and Picard had a bad feeling about this, like, three minutes ago...

 > **JANEWAY**: Jean Luc, how'd you like a trip to Romulus?

I won't explain that [Kate Mulgrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Mulgrew) plays the admiral, because I have to assume that everybody reading these posts has watched at least an episode or two of **Voyager**.  But as mentioned at the top, that show ended with the crew returning home.  Sadly, we never got the sequel film where the crew needs to join forces with the Harlem Globetrotters to fend off a Borg invasion of their Delta Quadrant hotel[^hzuDOX].

[^hzuDOX]:  I apologize for anybody's flashbacks, there.  The rest of you can go ask your parents...

 > **JANEWAY**: There's more. He's Reman. Believe me, we don't understand it either. You're the closest ship, so I want you to go and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire Quadrant.

It seems worth mentioning that Janeway's first comment at least reinforces, if it doesn't confirm, the impression that we got *way* back in [*Balance of Terror*]({% post_url 2020-04-16-trek-balance %}), that the "Romulan Star Empire" doesn't have a lot to it.  One imagines that "Reman" refers to an inhabitant of Remus.  And the map in that original episode strongly implied that the empire consisted of two planets, Romulus and Remus, presumably names applied by humans after the mythical [twin-founders of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus).

In all this time, we have never gotten a mention of any planet under their control except their home world, and this first reference points to the only other planet that we even know exists in their neighborhood, suggesting a tiny base of power.

Also, it shows their real impression of the constant Romulan threat that the only ship that can respond to anything only finds itself there as it breezes through the neighborhood on the way to a second wedding reception.

 > **JANEWAY**: The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans. You seem to get all the easy assignments!

In other words, go watch **Insurrection** and [**First Contact**]({% post_url 2025-12-18-first-contact-1 %}).

Also, though, having watched those films recently, her sarcasm makes no sense, for (at least) three reasons.  First, and most direct, he didn't get assigned either of those missions; he pushed his way into them, because he and the crew couldn't tolerate the spotlight shining somewhere else for a couple of hours.  Then, Starfleet served as the bigger antagonist in **Insurrection**.  Third, neither of those misadventures feels like anything near as difficult as what they dealt at the forefront of the war against the Dominion on Deep Space Nine *or* what Janeway herself dealt with on *Voyager*.  Hell, Picard spent most of **Insurrection** pretty much on vacation.

I will grant you that Janeway only returned to the Federation recently, and so might only know what happened in the other films from conversations at cocktail parties and assumed that nobody would violate orders to stay away *twice*.

 > **PICARD**: Coup d'état?
 >
 > **RIKER**: The Praetor's power's always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind Shinzon for him to have overthrown the Senate.

They must feel so jealous, considering that [*Conspiracy*]({% post_url 2022-11-03-conspiracy %}) had them leading an insurrection against Starfleet, and nobody gave them control of any government...

 > **LAFORGE**: An individual more like you, you mean.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Maybe he's not supposed to be like you, Data. Maybe he's supposed to be exactly the way he is.
 >
 > **DATA**: That might be so, but I believe he should have the opportunity to explore his potential.

And he will give him that opportunity by...forcing a new personality on him?

Compare this to [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %}), where we got the strong impression that Data only set up the hardware, then let the personality figure itself out.  Now, he pretty much wants a clone, which in no way foreshadows upcoming events, given how ham-fisted and unrelated it all seems.  It actually sounds more like they meant it to echo the Romulan coup, then decided not to remind us that most of the protagonists often act like complete jerks...

 > Captain's log, stardate 56844.9. The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates. All our hails have gone unanswered. We've been waiting for seventeen hours.

They whine when they have work to do, and they whine when they have no work to do.

 > **PICARD**: She's a predator.

Or, "she" realizes that every time some Federation goon passes anywhere near their territory, they start looking for things to shoot, as both Worf and Riker demonstrated for us, moments ago.

 > **VICEROY**: Enterprise. We are the Reman war-bird, *Scimitar*.

Through voice alone underneath the prosthetics, you probably recognize the Viceroy as [Ron Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Perlman), who has worked in the industry for about fifty years, including plenty of voice-over work, but has recently become more prominent for consistently calling out Donald Trump on social media.

 > **SHINZON**: I hope you'll forgive the darkness. We're not comfortable in the light.

And you presumably already know that [Tom Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hardy) plays Shinzon, and would become significantly more respectable than this...while also starring in the *Venom* films[^AqPOy6].

[^AqPOy6]:  No offense to the *Venom* films, which many people have told me that I'd probably enjoy, but I don't think that anybody would call them the highest-class work coming out of Hollywood, probably a point in their favor...

 > **SHINZON**: Deanna Troi, of Betazed. Empathic, telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All this I knew. But I didn't know you were so beautiful.

Symmetry, I suppose, demands that the franchise repay Troi during her (alleged) swansong for all the times in the first season when she praised the great writing, such as [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %})'s "even the name sounds mysterious."  Actually, maybe they intended Picard assuming that *B-4* meant *before* as a callback to that, calling out the (surely irrelevant) inside joke that nobody in the audience would have caught.

 > **RIKER**: You seem quite familiar with our personnel.

Given that the script has "treated" us to bigotry, blatant sexism, and now adolescent jealousy as Riker gets his dander up because somebody complimented his wife, I hope that we won't need to wait long for Picard's inevitable hypocritical monologue about human perfection.

 > **SHINZON**: Oh I am, Commander Riker. May I touch your hair?

Given Riker's offended reaction, I have to assume that they wrote this to reference the common racist microaggression of a white person wanting to touch a Black person's hair.  And given that Shinzon points out that he has researched the crew, and the way that we see him needling people, I can only assume that he asked because Riker has done the same to colleagues.

If so, that might make Shinzon my favorite character in this mess, certainly the only one to cheer on with whatever crackpot scheme that he ultimately pulls out of his naughty bits.

 > **PICARD**: We came to Romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do it now.

As usually, Picard *hates* the idea that somebody might have more power than he does in a given situation, especially some weirdo alien...

 > **SHINZON**: Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize that we are one. I'm talking of the thing that makes us the same. Peace. We want peace. Right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true? But you're also thinking that the chance of peace is too promising to ignore. Am I right?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Yes.

Having spent a lot of time with Picard, I have to imagine that he only agreed with the first part, because he has actually yet to find a chance of peace too promising to ignore.  Well, OK, actually, it did happen once, but the Picard in [*Yesterday's Enterprise*]({% post_url 2023-08-10-yesterday-s-enterprise %}) grew up in an entirely different timeline, and even in that post, I pointed out the anomaly in his behavior.

Also, to repeat, half an hour into the story, and the antagonist strikes me as the least objectionable character...

 > **SHINZON**: Then you know it's a very rare syndrome. Genetic. Apparently all the male members of a family have it. Eventually I was treated, and now I can hear as well as you can, Captain. I can see as well as you can. I can feel everything you feel. In fact, I feel exactly what you feel. Don't I, Jean Luc? Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus! Just the two of us. Or, should I say, just the one of us. I think you'll be wanting this. 'Til tomorrow then, Captain. We have much to discuss. Computer. Return lighting to previous level.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: There's no doubt, Captain, right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft's syndrome. He's a clone. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.

To recap fifteen years of soap opera, I believe that we have the following.

- Picard had an estranged brother and nephew, who we met in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}) and who died shortly before [**Generations**]({% post_url 2025-12-04-star-trek-generations-1 %}), but he picked up a secret son in [*Bloodlines*]({% post_url 2025-10-23-bloodlines %}) and now a secret twin brother[^KtyASj].
- Riker got his secret twin brother in [*Second Chances*]({% post_url 2025-05-01-second-chances %}).
- Data got his first secret twin brother in the aforementioned *Datalore* and picked up a second one, here.
- Troi got her secret sister in [*Dark Page*]({% post_url 2025-07-10-dark-page %}).
- Worf got his secret brother in [*Sins of the Father*]({% post_url 2023-08-24-sins-father %}) and revealed his surprise adoptive brother in [*Homeward*]({% post_url 2025-08-21-homeward %}).
- Yar died, but got a secret (maybe) sister in [*Legacy*]({% post_url 2023-12-14-legacy %}), plus her retroactive lookalike half-Romulan daughter in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}).

[^KtyASj]:  Honestly, once you realize that cloning really only involves gestating an embryo whose genetic material matches a donor, using "clone" as a noun feels like a slur in waiting, rather than a term that makes a meaningful distinction.

And notably, nobody cares about La Forge or Crusher, except to acknowledge that they grew up with legal guardians of some sort, but no, nobody in the crew can meet them, because they live on New Canada or they died or something...

 > **RIKER**: Why?

Good question, given that one Picard has seemed like *way* more than we needed all this time.  But really, why does anybody have a new kid?  Keep a failing marriage together, give the older one someone to roughhouse with, fix the mistakes made when raising the first one, cheap labor in family enterprises, organ banking...

Also, I like how everybody stands there watching Crusher look into the DNA-periscope thing that presumably shows her exactly what shows up on the giant TV two feet away from it.

 > **DONATRA**: Do I serve you?

If Donatra looks familiar, then you might recognize her as [Dina Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Meyer), who has carved out a career mostly in genre fiction.  I have a soft spot for the short-lived **Birds of Prey**, myself, where she played Barbara "Oracle" Gordon, though most people probably recognize her from **Starship Troopers**, which I have admittedly never seen.

 > **SHINZON**: The Romulans had somehow gained possession of your DNA and I had been created, and when I was ready they were going to replace you with me. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet. It was a bold plan.

Look, I don't want to tell the Romulans how to Star Trek, but except for the (already mentioned) time that Picard murdered a bunch of superior officers, I definitely wouldn't have ever called him anywhere near "the heart of Starfleet," unless his family funds it.  We got a whole speech back at the beginning about how he would continue to captain the *Enterprise*, even though everybody should have moved on by now, and he probably needs to start planning for retirement.  And even if he does have far more clout than anybody has ever indicated, dim-witted as Starfleet personnel tend to seem, I feel like even they would notice if Picard suddenly became thirty-seven years younger and a few inches taller.

 > **SHINZON**: As happens frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan. They were afraid that I might be discovered and that it would lead to war. Not quite the face you remember.

I have to wonder what *film* this line refers to, since Hollywood has always had exactly this reputation of dropping important projects because the previous executive(s) championed them.

Plus, since he mentions the face, younger Tom Hardy looks more like Q than Picard, no?  And honestly, while talking about the aesthetics, could the production team not have done *anything* about the squeaky latex sound every time Shinzon moves?

 > **SHINZON**: I had always hoped I would be two meters.
 >
 > **PICARD**: As had I.

Somehow, it doesn't surprise me that Picard wishes that he stood taller...

 > **PICARD**: But how many Romulans died for your freedom?

It seems notable that the first time that Picard has shown any empathy for Romulans or people from any non-human culture, he does it to condemn a slave revolt for not going through proper channels.  Compare this to how he dragged his feet throughout [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}), when tasked to stopping a crew of mass murderers wiping out Cardassians based on some crackpot conspiracy theory.  Or compare it to how he personally treated the Borg in **First Contact**, not only wiping them out as violently as he could manage, but also murdering members of his own crew for having had contact with the Borg.

A better-educated person than myself would probably draw some specific parallel to how people throughout the Western Hemisphere cheered on the [Atlantic Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Revolution#Atlantic_Revolutions) as the best sort of social progress that they should consider following up...except for the [Haitian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution).  Not only did it receive little praise, but we left it out of many history books centering on the "Age of Revolution," and the distaste for *that* instance of violence colors relations with Haiti to today, as generation after generation of European-descended leadership sees Haitian leadership as iterations of organized crime and any violent crime as alleged evidence of civil strife.

 > **PICARD**: If you had lived my life you would understand my responsibility to the Federation. I cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.

Which part of this conversation doesn't look like Picard allowing his personal paranoia against the Romulans---and possible fear of cloning---influence his decisions?  Shinzon offers him a peaceful Romulan Empire, which would benefit the Federation, and all he has to say is "nah, bruh.  What if it doesn't work out?"  He doesn't want to hear more, see the reforms, talk to people who he met during [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-07-04-unification-part-2 %}), or really anything.

 > **SHINZON**: Were we Picards always warriors?
 >
 > **PICARD**: I think of myself as an explorer.

I see that the captain has chosen to continue rewriting his past, which started with his nostalgia for exploration at the start of **Insurrection**.

 > **PICARD**: ...new worlds. I'm trying to believe you, Shinzon. If there is one ideal the Federation holds most dear is that all men, all races, can be united. What better example, a Starfleet captain standing in the Romulan Senate. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship. In time, when that trust has been earned.

I thought that the Federation held truth most dear, or maybe that only applied during [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}).  Or maybe I misunderstood that and should have gone with leaving cultures to develop free of interference, where Picard gave us that attack-on-the-Federation's-soul monologue at the midpoint of **Insurrection**.  The conversation reminds me of the old [if you don't like my principles, I have others](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/09/groucho-principles/) quip, as if Picard suddenly remembers some deeply held conviction whenever it lets him berate somebody.

More to the point, though, notice that he talks about "uniting" people.  He doesn't see it as people coming together, where they all have agency, but an emptier idea that leaves plenty of space for top-down control in the name of unity.

Also, the fact that Picard sees his standing in an empty Senate chamber as some deep symbol of peace seems absurd, or at least self-congratulatory.  I vaguely remember that my eighth-grade class got to stand in the United States Senate chamber on one of their days off, and I can tell you that my presence there meant squat to how the country got run since then...

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain, there is something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs. Look at this! When the *Scimitar* de-cloaked, there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band. There! You're not going to believe this. It's thalaron.

Two minor items, here.

First, maybe lead with the *something else*, since everybody admitted that the main thing didn't seem important.

Second...actually, let's get to Picard's response, somehow in another scene, as if they *so* didn't believe it that they silently walked into another room before continuing the conversation, as totally normal people do.

 > **PICARD**: I thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.

OK, so yes, pardon another science digression, but I do find it hard to believe this revelation, in fact, because you can't tell me that people have theorized a new part of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum).  We have *defined*---not theorized and found, because we already know that every wavelength exists, pretty much by definition, and we only need to slap labels on the parts that we care about---the whole thing.

You might as well say, for those of you who don't want to follow the little physics lecture, that we suddenly noticed that Shinzon spells his name with the letter *zwipu*, long theorized to sit in the alphabet between *en* and *oh*.  We didn't even notice[^S9F2TF], because we read the screenplay in ASCII until we checked the logs.  No, you can't do that, because we define, rather than discover, the alphabet...

[^S9F2TF]:  Shortly after writing this, I stumbled across [SCP-033](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-033), a pretty funny (fictional, if you haven't encountered the SCP Foundation before) account of a small integer (*θ'*) that we never noticed before, pretty much the same idea as my newly discovered letter.

 > **PICARD**: Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its biogenic properties.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.

Wait.  This theoretical kind of electromagnetic radiation---light, if you don't mind oversimplifying things a bit---already has well-known properties.  Those properties led the Federation to *stop* researching it.

Also, you can measure out the radiation in tiny pieces, I guess with little measuring spoons for the photons.

The danger, I understand.  Broadly speaking, you have a danger proportional to the radiation frequency---red light has a lower frequency than violet, to orient you, here---which maps to the energy level of the photons.  Electromagnetic radiation starting around UV-C (which you might remember getting some press in the early days of the COVID-19 spread) will reliably [ionize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation) atoms and molecules, adding enough energy to the system that electrons start shedding, and so it starts directly damaging matter that it contacts.  If you increase the amplitude, though, even non-ionizing radiation will eventually burn.

The rest of this makes no sense, though, and I feel like it could've made sense if they didn't go to such lengths to specify everything, such as insisting on electromagnetic radiation, not to mention telling us that they banned knowing about something that might kill them...

 > **PICARD**: Come. Beverly, come in. Remember him?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: He was a bit cocky as I recall.
 >
 > **PICARD**: He was a damn fool. Selfish, ambitious, very much in need of seasoning.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: He turned out all right.

Did he, though?  Cocky, selfish, and ambitious all still feel pretty apt.

 > **PICARD**: I really wanted to believe Shinzon. But this thalaron radiation just can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.

Can he not...ask?

I have no idea where this "story" has to go, as I write this, but "I escaped the slave labor camp using a war-ship that I made from scrap with help from a subjugated culture" could neatly explain some dangerous bits.

For comparison, imagine coming on a recent-to-current Earth culture with no knowledge of the history of local technology.  What do you find, in terms of how people get around?  We take these metal boxes with wheels, load them up with a material that can react with close to the ferocity of a dozen sticks of dynamite.  We then use a continuous stream of those explosions to push the device faster than anybody can hope to react, leaving the pilots to fend for themselves alongside millions of fellow travelers with little more regulation than a multiple-choice test and a couple of scaled-back practical exercises.  Oh, and those explosions throw off dangerous fumes, which might kill the pilot if the system doesn't have proper ventilation and harms the health of people spending significant time near the thoroughfares.  Can you read anything about an individual commuter's intent based exclusively on those fumes?

 > **RIKER**: Imzadi.

It can't possibly take Riker this much effort to do something in a not-creepy way.  I already feel like these two have terrible chemistry together, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, but when it looks like your sexual partner has gotten in the way of your awkward thrusting, and you want them to step aside, maybe edit out the sex scene...

 > **SHINZON**: Imzadi. He can never know you as I can. He can never touch you as I can.
 >
 > **TROI**: This isn't real!
 >
 > **SHINZON**: Feel my lips.

It seems worth mentioning that this sexual assault comes soon after Picard and Crusher made it clear that Shinzon reminds them so much of a younger Picard.  Does that tie into young-Picard ruining his friendship in [*Tapestry*]({% post_url 2025-02-27-tapestry %}) after their sexual encounter?

 > **SHINZON**: Transport! Begin the download. Tea, hot.

Oh, no, the entirely predictable result of the crew's short-sighted actions have come back to haunt them as B-4 does the thing while Shinzon gets a beverage in a sinister tone of voice. {% emoji eyeroll %}

Out of curiosity, do you think that Shinzon had any back-up plan, here, if Picard doesn't have B-4 put back together?  Does he have the rest of the secret family members waiting[^EL6Fdn] on a cloaked ship in orbit, waiting for their chance...?

[^EL6Fdn]:  Yes, I spent a significant fraction of the 1980s wondering when Garth Knight would team up with KARR, too.  And while I wouldn't want to *watch* it, the hypothetical version of this film where Shinzon brought together Tom Riker, Lore (or B-4, here), Kurn, Sela, and whoever else that they could scrounge up at least sounds like it has some potential...

By the way, I can't imagine that the writers did this on purpose.  I mean, if they did, surely they would never shut up about their clever writing, and you'd find it mentioned in all the secondary sources.  But even if totally accidental, I have to appreciate the craft, here.  When the franchise introduced the Romulans in *Balance of Terror*, it seemed hard to avoid the impression that they wanted the enemy ship to look like a mirror to the *Enterprise*.  That episode kept reminding us that the Commander had almost exactly Kirk's instincts, and he shows a similar thinking that the time for militarism has passed; he takes advice from his jaded older friend and misfit assistant, reminiscent of Kirk's relationship with McCoy and Spock.  This, by contrast, feels like a ham-fisted attempt to bring that part of the Romulan arc full-circle, with a literal copy of the captain assisted by at least one literal copy of one of the crew...and Ron Perlman as Deanna Troi, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: Are you ready to plunge the entire Quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
 >
 > **SHINZON**: It amazes me how little you know yourself.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I'm incapable of such an act.

Seriously?  Do I even need to do this...?  [**First Contact**]({% post_url 2025-12-25-first-contact-2 %}) strongly implied that Picard used his recruitment by the Borg in [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-10-26-both-worlds-1 %}) to militarize the Federation, and starting with [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %}), Picard seemed intent on provoking a war with the Romulans, or his threats of starting a war in *The Wounded*.  Picard not only seems capable "of such an act," but he spent years seeming anxious to do it.

Anyway, we'll break here, after Shinzon has the unconscious guard killed.

## Conclusions

We got quite a bit out of this, despite most of my verbiage here trying to make sense of the story.

### The Bad

This half of the film spends quite a bit of time with Picard's body image issues and dismissing them as irrelevant in comparison to everybody else's body image issues.

We continue to see microaggressions and outright racism against the android and Klingon, the latter contrasting with seeing Picard's insecurities treated as respectable as opposed to Worf's.  They recognize microaggressions aimed at their majority, though, as offensive.  The plot of this half also focuses almost entirely on anti-Romulan paranoia, with a propensity towards violence against them shown multiple times, and Picard bristling at their having the upper-hand in a conversation.  Picard does show some empathy for Romulans, but only in the context of opposing a slave revolt for harming people in its liberation.

They also show us quite a bit of sexism, showing that they insult men by treating them as potentially subservient to women, plus Riker treating Troi like his property to protect.  And Riker also wants you to know that he will leer at people when he can.

Maybe related, we still see that nothing rates as a higher priority than the boss's ego.

Starfleet allows captains to use their ships as party buses.  And they may also let those captains retroactively rewrite their orders to match whatever they happen to have done in a particular situation.

The crew seems to have no situational awareness, finding the equivalent of a USB drive in the parking lot and immediately plugging it into their computers to see what they found.  They also don't seem to know how to prioritize reports, saving the shocking and actionable news for the end.  The implication that they could have substituted Picard with Shinzon also suggests that nobody in Starfleet really pays much attention.

The Federation bans research into phenomena theorized to pose a danger to people.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we---I don't know---all feign shock at the big death that **Picard** will shrug its shoulders at multiple times, as we wrap up **Nemesis**.
