Today marks [World Wildlife Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Day), a United Nations event to raise awareness of...well, the world's wildlife and its contributions to ecology and beneficial effects on humans.

On that brief note, on to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The repository now includes everything (so far) to use the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) (not minimized) CSS file to generate the equivalent CSS needed to create the link-annotation icons like you saw (if reading this on the website) about thirty words back.  It doesn't do anything too sophisticated.  In short, it takes a pair of lines that might look like the following.

```CSS
.si-unitednations::before { content: "\f5ab"; }
.si-unitednations.si--color::before { color: #009EDB; }
```

Then, it matches the icon name with an entry in a mapping file, which might look like this.

```YAML
unitednations:
- (ld)
- unesco.org
- un.org
```

Notice that the list includes a specifier---the `(ld)`---to show a shadow in both light and dark mode.  And given that information, it produces the CSS code to annotate that link, looking like this.

```CSS
a[href*="un.org"]::after,
a[href*="unesco.org"]::after {
  color: #009EDB;
  content: '\f5ab';
  font-family: 'Simple Icons';
  text-shadow: 1px 1px light-dark(black, white), -1px -1px light-dark(black, white);
}
```

Had the YAML only specified light-mode or dark-mode shadows, instead of both, the script would've set the other color to `transparent`.  Black and white serve as placeholders, for now.  Combined, that gives us an icon for, in this case, the [United Nations](https://un.org), outlined in black in light mode and white in dark mode, so that the light blue doesn't vanish against the beige-yellow or dark blue.

If you need something like this, the mapping file has a comment at the top explaining the format.  Now that I see it, I probably should've switched to using YAML for configuration a long time ago, purely for the convenience of adding comments...

At some point, I'll need to add code (and maybe a second configuration) to *also* handle the programming language icons that you can see in the code snippets in the last few paragraphs, and then maybe integrate that into a general download process.  In theory, I'd also like to separate the sites by category, as I do in my manual CSS.  For now, though, this will serve the purpose when I decide to upgrade the font next.

## Open Badges

{% github jcolag/badging %}

After a couple of weeks off, the Open Badges code now has example profiles, based loosely on the examples in [the documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0).  It also has the start---nothing completed, yet---of using [ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) signatures to create the "proof" that the badges need, including a quick script to use [OpenSSL](https://openssl.org/) to generate the key pair, with notes in the comments on how to verify and (manually) create the signatures.

Beyond that, you'll see some clean-up around the code, before I get ready to figure out how to make the badges "prove" themselves.  Oh, and the README file now actually says something that somebody stumbling across the project might find useful, as opposed to "Experiments with Open Badges."

## Next

I'd expect more work on Open Badges, this week, plus I have a new idea or two for **Notoboto**, as I work with some extremely long notes that I've written.

Also, maybe I'll get a hit of inspiration on the CSS work and make that better.  At some point, for example, I should *probably* update [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to something more recent than "whatever version they had when I started the blog," which means going through the same process of fixing the code-points for *those* icons.
