As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I don't have anything constructive to say, here, but I do hope that they can make some progress.

The thought popped into my head early in the week, so I scheduled it once I worked out the important parts of the quick joke (as opposed to trying to fit too much of the story into five hundred characters) and the right context.  For example, while I considered trying to schedule a thread of four toots every hour, one for Marley and each of the three spirits, the conceit doesn't really go anywhere once *Stave II* starts; nobody would care about a toot that said "Wait, why did nobody invite me to their parties? I bring the fun... #KnowMeBetterMan" or something similar.

 > The shop was a hub for writers, political figures, poets, and photographers to gather and form a community around‚Äîwith Vally being at the center of it. It resisted apartheid as one of the few places inclusive of different racial backgrounds, and many township and migrant workers were regulars at the store.

Granted, nobody would call this a *critical* story, but it caught my interest...

 > Aside from being inhumane, the seizure of personal belongings raises serious constitutional questions ‚Äî especially since sweeps often take place with little to no warning and authorities often fail to properly store belongings. Six unhoused New Yorkers recently sued the city on Fourth Amendment grounds, citing these practices.

Hashtags:  #Housing #Policing

Like many societal problems, a lot of this stems from the fact that we don't stop to ask about the goals of policies like homeless sweeps when they go into effect.  If we discussed it ahead of time, then we'd see that the policy has nothing to do with *solving* homelessness and everything to do with *hiding* homelessness so that we'll stop making the people responsible for causing widespread homelessness feel guilty by pointing out the flaws.

 > For even longer-duration storage ‚Äî over weeks ‚Äî many experts put their bets on hydrogen gas. Hydrogen exists naturally in the atmosphere but can also be produced using electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored in pressurized tanks and when it reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell or turbine, this generates electricity.

A lot of this looks promising, though I suppose that they also looked promising a decade ago...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113725865724222720)

 > Is a preface exquisitely written? No literary morsel is more delicious. Is the author inveterately dull? It is a kind of preparatory information, which may be very useful. It argues a deficiency of taste to turn over an elaborate preface unread: for it is the attar of the author‚Äôs roses, every drop distilled at an immense cost. It is the reason of the reasoning, and the folly of the foolish.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Project 2025 isn't just a guide to the masturbatory fantasies of the worst people in American politics ‚Äì far more importantly, it is a detailed map of the fracture lines in the GOP coalition, the places where it is liable to split and shatter.

This goes further than Project 2025, by the way.  Consider how Trump's opposition to funding the government crumbled shortly after people half-joked about "President Musk" giving orders.  It takes impressively little to provoke them.  We saw this during Trump's first term, where he'd change policy in reaction to *mean tweets*, though almost nobody realized that they could do it.
