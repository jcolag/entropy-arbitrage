## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Chain of Command, Part 1

I suppose that we should get rolling on this.

 > **NECHAYEV**: Thank you, no, Captain. I'm afraid there's no time for the usual pleasantries. I'm here to relieve you of command of the *Enterprise*.

Finally, after all the times that he's done blatantly illegal things, right...?

Anyway, you probably don't recognize [Natalia Nogulich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Nogulich) for anything other than this role, but seems to have guest-starred on plenty of shows.

 > **NECHAYEV**: The Cardassian forces which were recently withdrawn from the Bajoran sector, have been redeployed along the Federation border. They have mobilized three divisions of ground troops and their subspace communications have been increased by fifty percent. We believe that they're preparing for an incursion into Federation space.

I'll mention this again next week when talking about the following week's post, but this line tees up **Deep Space Nine**, which would premiere three weeks later, as the Bajorans ask Starfleet for help managing the old Cardassian outpost.

 > **NECHAYEV**: I hope we won't need to make that decision. We have decided to send the *Enterprise* to meet with the Cardassian representative and open talks. We're hoping that the presence of the Federation flagship on the border will send a message to their leadership about just how seriously we view the situation.

This feels like the flip-side of Picard's frequent warmongering---though not exclusively him---the idea that many people don't have actual opinions about going to war beyond wanting somebody else to make the decision for them.

 > **NECHAYEV**: I disagree. The Enterprise will be in a dangerous situation and I want someone on the Bridge who has a great deal of experience with the Cardassians. No offense, Commander, but that's not you.

Finally, somebody calls out Riker's constant disinterest in preparing for missions.

 > **RIKER**: I was going to explain this to you after the ceremony, sir.

Super-professional behavior, here, not following orders and procrastinating on telling the boss.  And he'll repeat the latter move later, as if he doesn't constantly suck up to Picard...

 > **TROI**: I wouldn't call it resistance. More like uncertainty. Most of them had served under Captain Picard for several years. They knew him, they knew what he expected. Now they're being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things, and they're uncertain how to react.

Except that they always follow Picard without question.  Jellico has different ideas and methods, and they mostly only bristle and whine.  They try to paint him as a jerk, but Picard has made these sorts of changes before, often less respectfully, and they jump to it.  Heck, episodes like [*Allegiance*]({% post_url 2023-08-31-allegiance %}) hinge entirely on the idea that the crew always follows whatever nonsense orders Picard coughs up.

In fact, it seems worth pointing out that Troi actually lies, here.  We haven't seen any uncertainty about his orders.  We've seen something much more like adolescent defiance.  Riker, upset that he didn't get promoted, refused to follow orders---with an implausible story about an inability to staff four shorter shifts---and avoided reporting the status to the new boss.  La Forge rolled his eyes at orders that Data's toadying tells us can definitely work without too much trouble.  And...well, let's let him say it.

 > **JELLICO**: I'm glad you brought this to my attention, Deanna. Unfortunately, I don't have time for a honeymoon with the crew. You've clearly given this a lot of thought, so I'd like you to take charge of the morale situation. Please see to it that they make the adjustment to the new routine quickly and easily. I have a meeting with the new Security Chief in five minutes, so the duty roster will have to wait. Thank you, Counselor. By the way. I prefer a certain formality on the Bridge. I'd appreciate it if you wore standard uniform when you're on duty.

Honestly, I love how they frame the uniform thing as one step too far, as if Troi---and I apologize for criticizing a performer's appearance, but I do so for a point---doesn't look like a complete buffoon in her catsuits and dresses that would make it impossible for anybody to take her seriously, even if they gave her something useful to do.  And as long as I need to talk about her appearance anyway, I might as well point out that I remember when this aired, everybody in my circle had a long laugh that this show spent five-plus years trying to make her "sexy," only to apparently accidentally discover that she looks better in the same uniforms that they have for everybody else.  They spent an entire year packing her into that progressively shrinking denim monstrosity, when they could've dressed her like an adult.

Oh, and I didn't bother to specifically quote his first line in the episode, but you might recognize Jellico as [Ronny Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Cox), who got his start in [**Deliverance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance) as the non-banjo part of [*Dueling Banjos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dueling_Banjos), had a run---as I hinted in [*The Quality of Life*]({% post_url 2025-01-16-quality-life %})---on [**St. Elsewhere**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere) near the end of the series, and a bunch more, plus his non-film music career.

Looking back from the future, we know that Jellico will get promoted to Admiral and become a recurring character on **Prodigy** as Janeway's foil.

Anyway, back to my line of thought from before this line, we know Riker's beef with him, and La Forge's.  Now we have Troi's.  And I've talked a bit at various times about how much this crew creepily seems to want to model a nuclear family with Picard as its patriarch.  In that context, and the childishness that we see on display, here, this feels uncomfortably like sitcom children trying to reject a possible father figure.  Jellico has committed the unforgivable sin, in other words, of replacing their surrogate father.

 > **WORF**: Shuttle-craft Feynman to Enterprise. We have cleared the shuttle-bay.

Despite the fact that they find multiple wrong ways to pronounce the name, the shuttle presumably references physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), who had recently died and probably hit the peak of his popularity at around that time, with popular-among-techie books presenting him as fun[^1].

[^1]:  Full disclosure, I read those books at around this time and found the anecdotes of him trying to one-up everybody completely insufferable, and I still judge people pretty harshly when they try to quote or emulate him.  And it'd probably surprise you (or maybe it wouldn't) how many scientists and engineers own bongos because Feynman played bongos.  And speaking of insufferable, Christopher Nolan's **Oppenheimer** casts Jack Quaid from **Lower Decks** as Feynman.

 > **CRUSHER**: That's why metagenics and other biological weapons were outlawed years ago. Even the Romulans have abided with those agreements.

Even the *Romulans*?  Wow, given all the attempts that they've made to commit genocide and conquer other planets, which...I guess something like that vaguely happened with Sela's nonsensical plots in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}) and [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-07-04-unification-part-2 %}), but this sounds a lot more like the usual assumptions about Romulans that they lurk around every corner with horrible plans.

 > **RIKER**: Well, I'll say this for him. He's sure of himself.
 >
 > **TROI**: No, he's not.

Note that Troi will use her empathy to help Picard undermine aliens and talk about her colleagues behind their backs, but apparently won't use them to actually help colleagues get through their problems.  I mean, it seems like, if she senses her boss has a confidence problem, then it sits directly in her job description to help him, rather than undermine him.

 > **RIKER**: The Federation will not start a war.
 >
 > **LEMEC**: That has always been your position. However, I have heard reports that a small team from the Federation has already been sent into our territory. Of course, I don't believe it. Such an attempt would almost certainly fail, and even if it succeeded, it would trigger a very serious response on our part.

Not only do we see the Federation's terrible reputation again, but Lemec brings receipts, making it clear that he knows about Picard's mission, strongly suggesting that the Federation won't take these negotiations seriously.

 > **MADRED**: A challenge. You should prove to be an interesting challenge. Possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years.

You might recognize Gul Madred as [David Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_%28actor%29), who---apart from a long career appearing pretty much anywhere that you might care to look, especially in genre fiction---we've seen as St. John Talbot in [**The Final Frontier**]({% post_url 2022-04-14-tff %}) and Chancellor Gorkon in [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}).

## Conclusions

We don't get much out of this episode, unless you enjoy watching adults engage in teen angst.

### The Good

We do finally see *some* objection to the lax and careless behavior that we often see in the franchise.

### The Bad

We see an alternative to the Federation's desire for a war, a vague apathy that they'll fight if they need to, but don't want to make the choice.

Unprofessional behavior pervades the episode, with multiple characters complaining about or rejecting their duties, seemingly on the basis that they don't personally like their new manager or don't see him as matching their vision of leadership.  Troi tries to cover this as a lack of personal confidence.

They continue to show the Federation's paranoia, both in assigning officers to engage in espionage based on a vague rumor and in referencing the Romulans as a low-bar for morality.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in seven days, when we argue about lighting arrangements in *Chain of Command*, part 2.
