Let's talk some about Black History, the fight against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, and why it all matters in the same sort of way.  In different ways, I've already said a lot of what I think that I want to say in this post, so I'll try to make this one quick while linking to prior writing.

![Shirley Chisholm reviewing a data table posted on a wall](/blog/assets/39254053445_5b1b5aa9fd_o.png "I may have spent an embarrassing amount of time trying, unsuccessfully, to work out the relevance of the data")

Generally, I try not to stay out of history-and-heritage months unless I have something specific to say.  Early in the life of the blog, I tracked down [a bunch of stories by Black Americans]({% post_url 2020-02-09-afam-lit %}) in the public domain for everybody to read at their leisure, and provided a translation of Victor Séjour's [*Le Mulâtre*]({% post_url 2020-02-23-mulaitre %}).  After that, I talked about the idea of [casting a Black actor as Superman]({% post_url 2021-03-07-super %}) in a too-late-for-February post, working from the apparently now-abandoned idea of having Ta-Nehisi Coates write a screenplay for the character.

And so we come to another February where somebody has provoked me into speaking.

## Cowardice

We have an administration [bashing "identity" months](https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-marks-black-history-month-while-pentagon-declares-identity-months-dead-/7959465.html), while demanding that agencies [purge evidence of diversity](https://futurism.com/the-byte/trump-nasa-purge-mentions-women) including (before they grew spines) [in education](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2025/01/25/air-force-pulls-class-with-tuskegee-airmen-video-after-dei-order/), complete with a goofy [flowchart to help people decide what documents to snitch on](https://futurism.com/the-byte/leaked-government-decision-tree-nsf).

I have this theory, though, that we can sum up with a W.E.B. Du Bois quote that I posted to Mastodon during the week, which you can find in [Friday's roundup]({% post_url 2025-02-14-week %}).

> There is but one coward on earth, and that is the coward that dare not know.

{% cite W. E. B. Du Bois %}

If you've read this blog for long, you probably already know that I think this.  When the Supreme Court planned to (and eventually did) gut affirmative action---the precursor to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, given a new, more explicit name in hopes that the bigots would stop inventing scandals to justify getting rid of it---I wrote a post explaining [affirmative action in terms that even a right-wing Supreme Court Justice could grasp]({% post_url 2023-07-09-affirmative %}).

In particular, I made the point that all these programs have a single idea at their core.

> **Show your work**.  If someone claims that you made a biased decision, can you refute that?  Can you back your claim that you found the objectively best candidate, and that the best candidate happens to coincidentally come from a commonly represented group?  If you can, then congratulations, you practice affirmative action.  If not, then can you really make those claims?

In other words, you *might* find that you can't find any better candidates for a position than white men, and so you might have a staff exclusively composed of those white men.  It could absolutely happen.  But without going to the trouble of making it possible for somebody---internal or external---to audit that analysis, then you actually have no idea how your selections stack up to the full pool of candidates.

## Executive Disorder

And yet, Trump's [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/) has this nonsense to say.

> Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our long-standing Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.  Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.

First, I should point out that DEIA policies *implement* the civil rights laws, not violate them, as you probably already know.  In addition, he blamed the [Potomac River midair collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Potomac_River_mid-air_collision) on a process that *verifies* that you have the best candidates, doubling down on it in [another Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/immediate-assessment-of-aviation-safety/)[^1].

[^1]:  Unrelated, the White House website and Executive Orders look much more like some incel's personal blog than a government apparatus.  The index doesn't even work as well as literally every other index page on the web for thirty years, and apparently doesn't number the EOs like any other administration would.

Oh, and don't forget the other insistence on [purging schools](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/) of telling kids about slavery and the existence of transgender folks.

> These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity.

He also whines that "unit cohesion" suffers when troops have individual identities in [yet another Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/), which the Department of Defense actually studied many times and found the contrary, but we can't expect anything like a connection to the real world with this doddering puppet.

## Collapsing Identity

For clarity, I don't want to pretend that this doesn't have real-world consequences.  Unable to actually roll back civil rights law at the moment, these directives and assertions will undermine support for the idea of equality, even if only through constant repetition of the lie that you can only have qualified candidates *or* candidates other than straight white men.  I try to prioritize how to fight back against these policies, not how to sink into despair about them, so while I laugh at these dolts, I don't do so by dismissing the severity of the damage that they'll inflict.

And laugh I will, because if the existence of slave plantations and transgender people undermines your "foundation of personal identity," what does your self-image even look like?  Actually, I already know the answer to that, and got into those views in [*Weird Enough?*]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %}).

> Nobody has any problem with weirdness, except for the people trying to get away with something.  Only confidence tricksters ("conmen") can't afford to embrace weirdness, because they can't afford to draw attention to themselves.

They need to look (and feel) as normal as possible, otherwise their con collapses.  If you know that most Americans (nearly 85% in some polls) support abortion, most Americans (about two-thirds) support immigrants and refugees, most Americans (another two-thirds) want to expand the social safety net for poor, middle-class, and older people while thinking that we do too much for the wealthy, and more, then it starts to look...well, *weird* (and conspicuous) that Trump plans to use the Department of Justice and FBI to hound his political opponents while President Musk eliminates agencies that would force his companies to comply with the law.  This brings me back to what I wrote in my [*Devils, in Detail*]({% post_url 2024-12-15-devils-detail %}) post, noodling around with the concerns with popular culture humanizing certain kinds of fictional villains.

> What, after all, do we hear most from these right-wing types?  They all want to return to "a simpler time," a time when people didn't have these big problems with gender and race and labor relations and whatever else.  But we know that people have *always* had those problems, especially in the West, where we needed to fabricate [race science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism) to justify colonizing places where other cultures already had societies, when we wanted their land.
>
> And worse, you can tell that *they* know it, too, by the policies that they propose to allegedly fix problems.  Housing, they want to fix by arresting homeless people (and now families of immigrants).  Labor, they want to solve by eliminating unions, so that everybody negotiates personally and in secret.  Sexism, they want to solve by keeping women at home and (ideally) pregnant.  Other gender and sexuality issues, they want to solve by forcing gender and sexual minorities back into the closet.  Race, they want to solve by not allowing anybody to talk about it.  They want to stop protests and definitely stop strikes.  And the list goes on, seemingly endlessly.

And let's not forget the [demands for loyalty](https://theconversation.com/how-trumps-plan-to-surround-himself-with-inexperienced-loyalists-could-backfire-244246), an attempt to exclude people who don't agree with them.

They want to return to---as I tried to point out---not a simpler time in history, but a simpler time in their lives, a childhood when they could avoid knowing about unfairness in the world and (therefore) feel a twinge of responsibility for fixing it.

## Actual History

And because of that, they lash out in irrational fear.  Weirdness exposes their criminality, so they insist that everybody, even you, think and act like them, or would if you could.  Diversity draws attention to their bigotry and *mediocrity*, so they need to get rid of it.  The "identity" months, such as Black History Month, quietly teach about the necessity for diversity *and* why we need to put in extra work to achieve it, so they obsess over getting rid of them.  Differing opinions means exposing their intellectual bankruptcy and obsolete ideas about everything, so they need to stamp those out and dismiss anybody who values them.  They've tied so much of this hatred and ignorance to their identities that describing the failures in our history feels like a personal attack, so they shriek about people shaming them for their identity.  And maybe most important, even if not directly relevant to this post, they need you confused and despairing, so that you believe that nobody can stop them.

In a lot of ways, this makes history deep resistance and diversity initiatives a competitive advantage.  Learn about [Phillis Wheatley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillis_Wheatley), [Benjamin Banneker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Banneker), [Sally Hemings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings), [Harriet Tubman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman), [Nat Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner), [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass), [Zora Neale Hurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston), [Florence Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Price), [Claudette Colvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudette_Colvin), and so many more.  Learn about our country's system of slavery, subsequent [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws), and its modern equivalents in racialized prison sentences and forced labor; race riots such as the [Tulsa massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre) and the [Wilmington coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_massacre); and other events illustrating that Black history and white supremacist history substantially overlap.

And most of all, understand that---despite the phrase's use as the slogan of Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign---we stand stronger together.  Diversity makes us better, by *allowing* us to pick the best candidates, rather than sifting through a choice of trust-fund babies who only really know how to whine about how they can't get ahead.
