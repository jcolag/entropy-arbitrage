As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

At this point, I'd settle for not having Supreme Court Justices who find it a *benefit* to use laws from a time when many Americans didn't have any realistic civil liberties, but I do like the premise.

Given that Project 2025 seems to have fallen out of the headlines, it seemed worth circulating this reminder, especially as the "don't lecture people who don't want to vote for Democrats" crowd starts getting loud again...

It bothers me a bit that the article doesn't mention its behavior under the conditions found at a landfill, where you can often find food---also biodegradable with significantly less chemical manipulation---preserved for *decades*.  I don't think that it helps anybody to have a bag or clam-shell case that can only biodegrade if you remember to send it to the recycling center.

 > Of Trump‚Äôs funding, $50 million came from a single check from wealthy banking family scion Tim Mellon. Trump is being bankrolled by a billionaire boys' club‚Äîa group of immorally wealthy men sitting on a mountain of cash, who see his candidacy as their best chance to end democracy and bring in an era of neo-feudal plutocracy.

Hashtags:  #Trump #USPol #Plutocracy #Fundraising

I should also note that, unless I grossly misunderstand election financing, if a billionaire would prefer to directly donate a lump sum to Trump's campaign instead of laundering it through dozens of charities, Super PACs, the legal equivalent of straw donors, and other screens, then they see Trump's position in the campaign as an emergency to fix, not a success to support.

Unfortunately, that means that he'll almost certainly (have his supporters) lash out more, possibly inciting violence where he can.  However, this also means that enough effort could crush the Republican Party badly enough that we can start actually fixing the country...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://images.theconversation.com/files/600881/original/file-20240614-21-qgfh6a.jpg|A car fails to yield as a family attempts to cross a road in Long Beach, CA|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Traffic engineers build roads that invite crashes because they rely on outdated research and faulty data](https://theconversation.com/traffic-engineers-build-roads-that-invite-crashes-because-they-rely-on-outdated-research-and-faulty-data-223710) from The Conversation

 > Look more deeply, and you can start to see how our underlying crash data gives everyone a pass but the road users themselves. Everyone wants a data-driven approach to road safety, but today‚Äôs standard view of crash data lets automakers, insurance companies and policymakers who shape vehicle safety standards off the hook for embiggening these ever-larger cars and light-duty trucks.

This doesn't end at vehicle-size, for a lot of us.  On Long Island---which has a shape pretty much as you'd expect---where I live and so know fairly well, traffic engineers have told me that their predecessors decided that, because the island looks a bit like a tiny California on its side, and since people looked at California at the time as traffic engineering's big success story (stop laughing...), that they only needed to take what engineers did in California and scale it down.  Among other things, this means that we often need to get up to highway speed in four or five car-lengths, because that proportion worked well when the area scaled up to the size of California.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [You Probably Unwittingly Voted to Give Elon Musk a Huge Raise](https://www.404media.co/you-probably-unwittingly-voted-to-give-elon-musk-a-huge-raise/) from 404 Media

 > What this means in practice is that, because of its millions of investors who put billions of dollars into its investment vehicles, Vanguard itself has 232 million Tesla shares, and owns 7 percent of the company. It is the second-largest shareholder of Tesla stock, behind only Musk himself. This money is not actually ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äôs,‚Äù it is the money of all of the investors and 401(k) holders using Vanguard to invest. But Vanguard does not ask those individual investors if they want to give Elon Musk a gigantic raise. Vanguard votes on their behalf.

This gets back---appropriately enough---to something that I wrote about when Musk bought Twitter.

 > If this service ever gains credibility for circulating useful information, what dollar value puts the service into the hands of someone who wants to discredit the community?

And while [I framed that as social media]({% post_url 2023-04-23-federation %}), because I had that topic on the table, we really need to start looking at *every* service that we rely on in these terms.  What would it cost for a hypothetical attacker to subvert your power company, your favorite television show, your favorite foods, or yes, the investment back that manages your retirement savings?  If it cost Musk another twenty billion dollars---for example---to interfere with Vanguard's leadership so that he could have them vote for him to get his fifty billion dollars, then he would definitely do that.

In this case, he didn't *need* to do that, because wealthy people understand class solidarity far better than the rest of us do.  But if we don't know those numbers, then we don't see the blatant connections.
