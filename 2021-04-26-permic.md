The holidays for today are a bit thin, but having something of an interest of languages, Old Permic Alphabet Day, celebrating the [Old Permic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Permic_script), an adaptation of the more common [Cyrillic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script).

Pardon the low quality of the image, but you're here on Mondays for code.

## Doritís Onomáton

Especially given the work involved in [releasing **All Around the News**]({% post_url 2021-04-25-aatn %}), I deliberately kept my work to a minimum while still moving the ball forward.  In this case, that meant focusing on **Doritís Onomáton**, especially since I'm going to want to release an **AAtN** app at some point.

I added a bunch of alphabets and abugidas...the latter probably done poorly, so if anybody sees improvements, I'd appreciate them.  I also separated the scripts into a separate file for maintainability.

In addition to that, I finally added a rudimentary About box, swapped the direction of swipe gestures for consistency with other apps, and added a tap gesture to copy a name to the clipboard.

## Next

I should probably add an option to show the session's saved names and fiddle with a few of the abugidas.  This also needs a server before I can justify submitting it to app stores.
