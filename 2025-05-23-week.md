As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

It shouldn't, at this point in my life, but it still always shocks me to re-remember that we in the United States live under a legal regime where we don't see "probably didn't actually do the crime" as a reason to avoid executing a person.

Even though the media *still* tries to make Trump look like a serious person who might get things done right, this time, I can't help noticing that I no longer see Trump hats and flags, nor do I hear any talk radio coming out of passing cars, even as the temperatures rise, meaning that we all have more windows open than we did a few months back.  That tells me that he has lost a *lot* of support in less than four months.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Education #Disability #Trump

You'll notice that Trump (and most Republicans) likes to set the country up for what I've heard called "policy laundering."  You divide the country by removing federal-level regulations or enforcement to "leave it (whatever issue) up to the states."  This creates a patchwork of laws and regulations that depend heavily on how much money each state has and how well they can resist pressure from special interests.  Then, once the special interests have flipped one state, they start arguing for the standards to lower in neighbors, because dealing with multiple jurisdictions confuses them so much.

Therefore, they always "leave it to the states" when it might improve our standard of living at the expense of the wealthiest elites, but will gesture emphatically at the [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) when it means that they can censor views that they don't like or something similar.

 > All over the world they are waiting for the signal from us. They---the junkers, the kaisers, the militarists, the capitalists---have converted all Europe into an ocean of blood, a valley of tears, a ghastly nightmare of existence. But the people long to return to the state of human happiness. All over the world there is an untold longing for peace.

 > Another reason Middle Paleolithic evidence appears rare in East Asia is because what now seem to be less typical variations of the Quina tool kit previously found in China had been overlooked, likely due to archaeologists‚Äô narrow definitions based on European examples.

Hashtags:  #Archaeology #Paleolithic #China

It occurs to me that the narrative prior to this evidence actually plays well on both sides of the cultural divide.  As mentioned, it makes perfect sense for the West to dismiss China's development---especially after they've shown us up so often---because their tools don't look identical to ours.  But it also fits how China sees itself that it could "skip" a common stage of development and move to more advanced technologies.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Despite increasing scrutiny from legal systems, evidenced by [rulings against Google for illegal monopolies in search and advertising](https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates), the political influence of Big Tech appears to have increased. The symbolic image of US Big Tech CEOs in the front row of the presidential inauguration underscores their deep connections with government bodies, potentially hindering much-needed oversight at a time when human rights and democratic structures face unprecedented challenges globally.

I think that we've all felt the effects of this decline in progress.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Viruses that roam the fungal kingdom](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2025/the-strange-viruses-that-infect-fungi) from Knowable Magazine

 > Some [viruses] have no coat at all, notes Suzuki, who coauthored an article about [fungal virus diversity and evolution](http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/eprint/VMWEA5KUHTZT3HDMXYGB/full/10.1146/annurev-phyto-021621-122122) for the _Annual Review of Phytopathology_. They never seem to leave their host‚Äôs comfortable embrace. And in one interesting case, Suzuki and colleagues came across a virus that has no coat of its own but [borrows the coat of another virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20151). They named the borrower _yado-kari_, the Japanese term for hermit crab, which translates to ‚Äúborrowing a room to stay.‚Äù They called the other virus _yado-nushi_, for ‚Äúlandlord.‚Äù

I'll tell you, the more I read about fungi, the more it feels like an idea created for some science fiction story.  Every time, we learn that it looks intelligent, invisibly supports the ecosystem, has infections that don't match anything else, and so forth.
