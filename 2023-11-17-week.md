As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Buying groceries online makes life easier for anyone who has trouble purchasing food in person, including people with disabilities, those with limited transportation access or those living in remote locations.

I don't know if I've ever mentioned it before, but it turns out that giving poor people money *that they can spend* reduces poverty.  The more you condition that money---forcing them to show up in person, requiring that they constantly push their job search forward, auditing their financial information to verify that they can't survive without the money, and so forth---the less it reduces poverty.  Therefore, especially if you want to play the role of Class-Not-Race Guy, for some reason, then you should actively support policies that get more unconditional money into the hands of poor people.

Oh, I bring something like this up a bunch of times every year?  Who knew...?

At my own high school---if you'll pardon the personal history---whether we took her classes or not, a Black female science teacher probably became the first person to challenge many of us to become better people, and that work (of course) went sadly under-recognized.

Even in business-friendly majors, I watched for close to twenty years at my own school, as they replaced or removed any class that didn't apply directly to getting a typical programming job.  I can only imagine how bad things have gotten in entirely separate departments.

Oh, hey, it looks like advertising destroys everything it touches, and maybe we should stop relying on it as the method for funding basically all mainstream art everywhere.  As a reminder, the United States Supreme Court [nearly banned advertising in 1967](https://theconversation.com/advertising-is-obsolete-heres-why-its-time-to-end-it-101639), and the [PageRank paper <i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf) details the toxicity of advertising in its first appendix.  Again, then, maybe we should stop relying on it to fund everything...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw Israel/Palestine %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Digital Blackout: Systematic censorship of Palestinian voices](https://globalvoices.org/2023/11/08/digital-blackout-systematic-censorship-of-palestinian-voices/) from Global Voices

 > Some users face challenges hosting live videos. Posts containing hashtags like ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Stand With Palestine‚Äù are often hidden or removed, under the pretext of violating the platform's content policies.

The stakes feel too high and I feel far too unqualified to say anything definitive about the overall situation, but it does consistently strike me how language and institutions somehow always find a way to "accidentally" favor one side to the exclusion of the other.

 > Max Fawcett, head of Christie's jewelry department in Geneva, said the diamond was unique because of its deep rich blue color and its unmodified pear brilliant shape.

I hate the politics and economics around diamonds and other gems, like anyone who pays attention.  However, even I can't help but take a beat to admire this thing.
