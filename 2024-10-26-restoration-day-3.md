This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes the first phase of reading **Restoration Day**, from *A Place of Safety* to *Hidden Worth*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Restoration Day**
 * Location:  <https://deborah.makarios.nz/restoration-day/>
 * Released:  2018
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Deborah Makarios](https://deborah.makarios.nz/)
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately one hundred two thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Restoration Day

The author describes the book as follows.

 > Princess Lily was born to be queen, but she leads a pawn’s existence in the shadow of her guardians’ control. She dreams of the day when she will take her rightful place in the world.
 >
 > At last her chance arrives, with a quest for the three Requisites of Restoration Day, the royal rite which renews the life of the land. But she’s been hidden away too long, and Arcelia has changed.
 >
 > Stripped of everything but the identity which has become a life-threatening liability, Lily will need to do more than cross the board if she is to emerge triumphant as the queen she knows she must be. The land she thought was hers becomes the field for a gripping game—and this time she’s playing for her life.

Beyond that, you know what I know, at this stage.  I don't [follow Makarios on Mastodon](https://theres.life/@DMakarios), but following Free Culture-related tags means that I do see posts related to her books from time to time.

## What Works Well?

We finally get new characters added to the cast with some substance.  I could see "Gran Vi" and her family shifting into leading roles in other stories, rather than tokens who service the plot that often populate fantasy stories.

Appropriate to our setting the book aside, too, it feels like the plot has started to pick up some momentum.  We have mostly replaced Lily's childish insistence that things will work out neatly for her with something that resembles an actual path forward, likely following clue to clue.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Jumping between the two narratives feels wasted, to me, especially since one of the two usually only has one or two things happen before moving back.  It also doesn't feel like it develops anything new, only rehashing the idea from prior chapters that Candra has put itself in service of delaying the Magister at all costs.  On its own, it'd probably read better, but dropping the main thread every couple of pages for an arrow or a battering ram makes it almost feel like a joke that we'll never get.

Maybe similarly, the book also introduces a set of vibrant characters (as mentioned), only to inexplicably condemn them to several pages of exposition that I can't imagine informing anything else that we see.  I get that this sort of conversation would really happen, and I even like the writing, but it feels like we could've gotten the same information with more emotional impact if the book had gone down the "show, don't tell" route instead of an explicit family history.

## Opportunities

Other than paying for the books and leaving (kind) comments, I don't see many options.

## What's Adaptable?

This section introduces us to Woodward's sanctuary and the Leaf and Bud Inn, plus a variety of characters.

## Coming Attractions

We'll shelve **Restoration Day** for now, so that it doesn't overstay its welcome, though we'll almost certainly return to it someday.  Coming up next week, then, we'll read the episodic comic **Everybody Loves Eric Raymond**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
