Quite possibly, nobody celebrates it but me, but today marks the anniversary of the first installment of the [Great Moon Hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moon_Hoax) in the New York **Sun** newspaper.  Teased a few days in advance, six weekly articles allegedly reprinted from the **Edinburgh Courant** claimed that none other than [John Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel) pointed his fancy new telescope at the Moon, only to find an assortment of fantasy animals---the beavers without tails make a nice touch---and a civilization of bat-winged humanoids.

And with that, on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the sixth.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the ninth of September.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For August, I wrote up my few-weeks' thoughts about the Framework laptop, provided updates on the people-search websites, discussed my media consumption, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you may have already seen previews for some of that.

## Social Media

As mentioned, while you'll notice that I did update a thing or two that currently only sits on GitHub for now, I have toned down my contributions there.  In all probability, while I might move most of my normal operations to Codeberg or someplace similar, I won't *give up* GitHub, if only because people look there[^1], and a lot of projects will continue to use it as their hub.

[^1]:  Job applications, in particular, increasingly ask for a GitHub profile.  And unlike {% x %}, the activity map makes an abandoned account conspicuous, to a degree that "I don't agree with Microsoft corporate policy" will likely explain.

As such, expect some daily activity to continue over there, but it'll increasingly shift to serving as a backup of repositories hosted elsewhere, rather than the place to file issues and pull requests...not that I've gotten more than a couple of either that I didn't create, in all the years that I've used GitHub.  And therefore, expect these posts to increasingly point to projects on Codeberg and maybe other sites.

## Cooking

Last time, I discussed making pumpkin seed butter, and mentioned that I had a meal in mind for it.  If you have read along with these posts for a while, you might remember that I once posted a hand-wavy recipe for [toasted oats and banana]({% post_url 2022-05-30-andrews %}), heating the oats in a pan until they start to brown, then adding (among other things) a banana, which serves to hydrate the oats while also cooking the fruit.  And then I stirred in a small amount of peanut butter at the end.  I make it regularly.

Taking that approximate template, I swapped the banana out for shredded sweet potato, as they've started to come into season.  It needs to cook significantly longer to cook the sweet potato through, but once I figured that out, it came out really well, a dull orange with bright flecks of green, even if that scheme doesn't become seasonal for a bit, yet.  It tasted great either way, though.

After that, I revisited the "churning" process---one has to imagine that nobody would seriously call it that, but I don't have a better term---following the process of toasting in an oiled pan before dropping it in the food processor.  I used up that bag of "peanut butter stock," giving me about a jar and a half[^2], the half also getting some cocoa powder and a small amount of sugar.  Also, I revisited the pumpkin seed butter this way through, and it came together much faster, this time (but still took a lot of scraping and oil), and it came out much smoother.  (A contaminant may have gotten into the batch, though, so I'll probably reserve it for cooking, like with sweet potato and pumpkin.)

[^2]:  For years, I hung onto glass jars as companies started phasing them out in favor of plastic.  Everybody asked why, even as I used them for food storage...

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage %}

...Let's talk about Creative Commons iconography.

I know, this feels like the situation where you walk into a college class and, rather than teach, the professor sits on the front corner of the desk, sighs, and talks about some barely related topic on their mind, until somebody else needs the room.  But I promise that I genuinely need to do this to make sense of the change that I'll report later.

When Creative Commons launched, they did so with several sets of "button"-style images to indicate the license used.  You know the images that I mean.  They insisted that, while you *could* do so, you shouldn't download them.  Rather, you should hot-link the image from their server, so that people can search for the image URL, such as this one.

```
https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png
```

And the search results would magically turn up works released under the relevant license.  Change the sizes a couple of times, iterate through the license versions that you care about, and you should end up with a decent collection of works...in theory.

Somehow, search engines never got the message, making "search for a specific URL across the Internet" surprisingly difficult, unless you pay for one of those Internet marketing setups that specifically looks for URLs on pages, designed so that you can beg people who link to your competitors to point in your direction instead; you know, the serious class acts.  And anyway, nobody paid attention to what Creative Commons said[^3], so they downloaded the images and used them on their own servers, defeating the purpose, even if somebody managed to invent a search engine that would actually *search*.

[^3]:  They still don't, perhaps explaining why you can't go too long on social media without somebody asking which Creative Commons license that they can use to exclude AI training (or military work, or whatever).

Fast-forward over the years, and Creative Commons has mostly said that they'll continue to maintain the images on their website for people who followed their early advice, *but* since nobody pays them any mind anyway---and probably because they have grown to hate the idea that people see their licenses as different, based on the effects that those licenses have---and searching for the URLs doesn't do what it should, maybe don't use the button images at all.

### Wait, I Use One

This blog has always disregarded that later advice, and hot-linked the image, down at the bottom, when linking to the license used around these parts, in hopes that somebody, somewhere, would invent a search engine that only finds the literal target text instead of trying to guess what question you meant to ask or assuming that you confused a search engine for a web browser.

Do you follow me, so far?

OK, then.  During the week, when working on yesterday's post---more on that, later---I had reason to wonder what license Creative Commons uses for those button images[^4].  Looking it up, for probably the first time, I [discovered this](https://creativecommons.org/policies/#:~:text=How%20you%20can%20use%20CC%20trademarks).

[^4]:  A draft of yesterday's post included the CC Pro and CC BY-NV images.  When I went to write the image credits, I realized that "released into the public domain" didn't tell the full story, because they derived from somebody else's work.  And if Creative Commons released the original images under a share-alike license, then I should note that in the credits.

> CCâ€™s trademarks are not licensed under a Creative Commons license. You are authorized to use our trademarks subject to this Trademark Policy, and only on the further condition that you download images of the trademarks directly from our website...

They do *not* provide a public license for the "buttons," in fact, and now you can now only legally use them if you download your own copy to serve from your website, while also following their trademark policy.

OK, then why do I put one on every page?  It doesn't land in the repository, because I hot-link it, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a huge *licensing* problem, but it does cut against my philosophy for the blog to use the images, now that I know that Creative Commons didn't release them under a public license[^5].  Likewise, if they only allow the use for people who download them, then that does create an explicit licensing problem for the blog, and I certainly don't want to do that.  And yes, it makes *sense* that they wouldn't license those images, because derivative works would undermine their claim to the brand, which would in turn allow people to maliciously claim that they have new versions of the license that has bad effects, destroying their credibility without them even needing to send out a single ill-advised press release about LLM-training as Fair Use or the magic utility of non-commercial licenses.  But an unlicensed image used across my blog still seems like a problem for me to fix.

[^5]:  I keep saying that I treat Creative Commons like I treat the Free Software Foundation, an organization that maintains useful licenses, but who we should probably otherwise ignore, because they don't understand or support the movements that they see themselves as leading.  People got sick of them with their AI Signals thing, but nonsense like the images, the non-commercial licenses with no definition of commercial activity, and so forth should've made a much bigger mess of their reputation.  But I definitely see value in the licenses.

Then I remembered that weird [page of alternative license logos](https://freedomdefined.org/Logos_and_buttons) that I always stumble across and then ignore, because it never made any sense to create off-model branding assets for licenses[^6]...or at least, it didn't make sense to me until now.  I used the aforementioned 80Ã—15 image, and they have a set measuring 80Ã—16, the *Small buttons*, which I'll call close enough.  For whatever reason, though, they only have buttons labeled Attribution, Share-Alike, GNU FDL, and Public Domain, not CC BY-SA.  However, a few minutes with Inkscape fixed that, producing this.

[^6]:  OK, I also find the majority of them unspeakably ugly and dated.  The "best viewed with Internet Explorer"-looking set doesn't even seem to want to parody that idea.

![CC BY-SA](/blog/assets/cc-by-sa.png "I don't love the style, but it'll suffice.")

It looks like [Bryan Tong Minh](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Bryan) created the originals---plus the [SVG template](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_button_small.svg) used above---and released them into the public domain (thank you, Bryan, wherever you've ended up), based on Marc Falzon's Free Culture Definition ball, also released into the public domain, so *this*, I can use without concerns over licensing.  And so can you, if you want, in the public domain like the rest, since I only rearranged elements of the originals, and probably couldn't claim copyright on it if I tried.  Since Thursday's post, if you scroll to the bottom of the page, you'll now find that image (hosted locally) representing the license instead of the official image.

I didn't bother to use a font that would match the other examples, so I wouldn't actually recommend using my specific CC BY-SA logo if you might also want to use any of the others.  This uses a fairly generic sans-serif font that looks readable at such a small size, [DejaVu Sans](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/), in particular.  Because of that existing distinction, I also changed the "ball" to the alternate blue/purple color scheme found in [K Tucker's alternate seal](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Libre_Knowledge_Culture_Society_ethereal_SVG.svg) that adapts the ball.  It also seemed appropriate to change the ball in some way, because this has no association with the team behind the Definition of Free Cultural Works.  If somebody makes a consistent set with either color scheme or another one entirely, I'll probably replace my image without much concern.

Yeah, I know, that seems like a lot of ranting to get to "I replaced a tiny image that most people never even noticed," but you have to admit that stating the action would've made no sense at all without the story.  And it also seemed worth explaining my (extremely late) discovery that the Creative Commons images don't actually have any licenses covering them.

### The Font, Too

While I kicked all this nonsense around, it occurred to me that this might also warrant some thinking about the [CC Symbols font]({% post_url 2024-11-11-veterans %}) that the blog started using last year.  Again, it *probably* qualifies as Fair Use, or beneath the threshold of creativity to warrant copyright, but if Creative Commons protects its "trademarks," does that extend to the "component icons" represented in the font?  I mean the images such as the human figure standing in a circle, or the copyleft symbol.

The specific legal answer probably doesn't really matter, because we probably shouldn't all rely on the same font, anyway.  I'll talk about dealing with that issue, later in the post.

## Question Copyright, The Good Parts

{% codeberg jcolag/qco %}

For a long time now, I have insisted, at least to myself, that I had this project coming down the pipe, and finally put it together, as regular readers probably noticed in yesterday's post about [creating the archive]({% post_url 2025-08-24-trawling-qco %}).

From 2007 to 2024, though petering out for a lot of that run, Question Copyright mostly published anti-copyright material, but also occasionally had some interesting ideas around the Free Culture movement.  I always had issues with that framing of Free Culture, and never particularly cared for the organization, but when they folded last year, I remembered that they did write some good things.

Some quick recovery, eliminating anything that didn't interest me, and adding a quick index file, and---with apologies to William Goldman---I present [Question Copyright:  Just the Good Parts](https://jcolag.codeberg.pages/qco), ten articles out of their seventeen-year run that I think have *some* potential to spark a good idea.

They released their entire site into the public domain early on, though, so if you would've made different decisions, you can put together your own "good parts" archive at your leisure.  Read yesterday's post for an overview of how to streamline the process a bit.

## Libera Marks

{% codeberg jcolag/libera-marks %}

As mentioned earlier in the post, because Creative Commons can---and probably should---enforce its copyright and trademarks on it iconography, and because I don't know if that extends or can extend to the various "component icons" that visually describe their licenses---the person representing attribution, the copyleft symbol, the non-commercial symbol, and so forth---it seemed worth creating an icon font that covers the seven Unicode code-points with images that nobody will confuse with anybody else's branding assets.  Like I said, it probably doesn't *matter* if this needs to happen, legally speaking.  Even if the icons don't meet the threshold of creativity to qualify for copyright, and even if the font would comfortably qualify as Fair Use, we might as well have alternatives to work with.

Therefore, referring back to that page of alternate logos, you'll notice further down the page that Terry Hancock---who you might recall as the driving force behind [**Lunatics**]({% post_url 2022-04-30-lunatics %})---started creating an alternate set of icons, distinct enough that they couldn't cause trademark issues.  Downloading those icons, I created a quick public domain and "CC" icon based on Hancock's existing designs to round out the set, and got to work.  The copyright symbol, this project leaves to other fonts, since that {% cc %} has a long enough history that it makes sense to let that look "native."

For my first pass, I tried out [Fantasticon](https://github.com/tancredi/fantasticon), the software rather than the science fiction convention, which takes a quick JSON configuration file.  However, it doesn't look like it can handle *all* of Unicode, only the lower blocks.  Therefore, it would only replace the no-derivatives icon, since that lives in math-adjacent-land.

For the next attempt, I hauled out [Fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/).  Having had a couple of bad experiences with it about twenty years ago, trying to make everything from BÃ©zier curves without really understanding the tools or the model, I hesitated a bit.  But they now support a scripting language.  That means that I can do something like this.

```
New()
Reencode("unicode")

Select(0x229C)
Import("svg/Fd_sq_icon_nd.svg")

# Continue for the other images and code-points
```

And...that does the same thing as Fantasticon did.  And it also doesn't quite work with these icons, when it does add them, because they appear tiny and somehow inserted into the *following* line of text instead of where I typed them.  The first problem comes from the encoding, to expand the spaces that the application will play with.  The other problem requires some manipulation of the glyphs.

```
New()
Reencode("ucs4")

Select(0x229C)
Import("svg/Fd_sq_icon_nd.svg")
Scale(96, 96)
Move(-64, 64)

# Repeat for each code-point and icon.
```

The scale, I (almost) get.  Hancock's icons have a default size of 64 by 64 pixels, and Fontforge assumes that its glyphs will present themselves as much larger.  I don't know why six thousand pixels---64 pixels times 96 comes to slightly more than that---makes sense, because I can't find it in the documentation, but it works.  Likewise, I can't wrap my head around the need to shift an image into position at all, though I imagine that it has something to do with Fontforge's assumptions, probably based on how certain fonts worked twenty years ago.  Instead of the `Move()` call, I can open the image in Inkscape and play with the view box, but that would turn this project into a manual process, which would make it more difficult for me to get right if I want to swap out the icons for new sets, or for somebody to reproduce this at home.

Speaking of "trying this at home," if you use arbitrary vector images for this, you'll need to change the `Scale()` and `Move()` calls to adjust to each glyph's needs.  I happened to luck out by finding a (mostly) complete set all constructed on the same assumptions.

Changing the `@font-face` CSS to point to the replacement font, this works directly with my existing plugin, since the font does the work of mapping from code-points to glyphs, allowing me to note works released as public domain {% cc pd %}, CC0 {% cc 0 %}, CC BY {% cc by %}, CC BY-SA {% cc by-sa %}, CC BY-ND {% cc by-nd %}, CC BY-NC {% cc by-nc %}, CC BY-NC-SA {% cc by-nc-sa %}, and CC BY-NC-ND {% cc by-nc-nd %}, including retroactively in posts where I used the icons.  I don't really like the designs, mind you, but they do convey the same information as the Creative Commons versions, to the extent that the Creative Commons icons really convey much of anything---see below---and I didn't need to do any of the design work, so I'd consider that a wild success.

For the sake of distancing the font from Creative Commons proper---since this scheme should work to describe plenty of licenses, ignoring the CC mark itself---I decided to call them Libera Marks, as in the Esperanto word for "free."  If I replace the icons in the future, I'll keep the name, because I expect to compose the entire user base for this for a while to come, and don't want to rewrite the CSS again, but will split the one with Hancock's icons off into another name and continue to maintain it.  Or each version will get a different codename, such as "Libera Marks: TH."

### You Might Want a Different Font

Note that, in the absence of an explicit statement to the contrary, such as what you see with the various button-style icons, Hancock published his work under CC BY-SA 2.5, so I updated the licensing for the whole font to the modern 4.0 version.  This does mean that you probably can't use it in a work that you release under the terms of most licenses.  I don't like to give much oxygen to those licenses, specifically due to these incompatibilities, so I don't *personally* mind that.  But I have also now charted out a path for you to build a font with whatever icons that you want in those positions, and you can find *plenty* of icons released into the public domain or under compatible licenses, if you don't want to make your own.

And honestly, I would expect more people to make their own, given that we now have two fonts that use a dollar sign to represent commerce.  I can't imagine that the rest of the world has given up on that particular fight...

Actually, now that I think about it, *most* of the now-traditional icons stink, if we want to convey information to people who don't already know it.  What about a person standing in a circle says "you must identify your sources"?  What about a crossed-out dollar (or your favorite currency) sign favors the interpretation of not using the work in a commercial transaction over (for example) taking a vow of poverty?  As I think about this in terms of distancing the symbols from literally Creative Commons---which the Unicode Consortium already should have done, rather than suggesting trademarked symbols---it feels like an opportunity to fix so many other things about the situation[^7].

[^7]:  Yes, I have some ideas for more generic images.  More on that in upcoming weeks, either through a second font or as a proposal for others to pick up on.

## Next

I need to clean up a bit of work on the Libera Marks font, especially making sure that I identify the licensing of everything correctly.  Yes, that means revisiting [REUSE](https://reuse.software/), since I have responsibility for the font, but limited my creative work fairly narrowly.

After that, I'll probably start mirroring repositories to Codeberg, so that I can push to both sites.
