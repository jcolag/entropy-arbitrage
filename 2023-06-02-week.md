As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > It's reasonable to expect that the new work requirements would force many people to make hard choices between the caregiving arrangements for their loved ones and keeping their benefits.

Hashtags:  #SNAP #GOP

Eventually, this game needs to end, right?  At some point, people have to stop hearing their fantasy that everybody who receives public assistance can secretly work full-time and treating it like a legitimate political opinion.

 > The root cause of these crises is our societal addiction to an outdated economic paradigm based on the single-minded pursuit of GDP growth at all costs.

Hashtags:  #GDP #Sustainability

I don't know that I necessarily believe the proposed alternatives, but GDP certainly doesn't make any sense.

 > The hospice care announcement prompted ongoing tributes and media attention on his 1977--81 presidency and the global humanitarian work the couple has done since co-founding The Carter Center in 1982.

Hashtags:  #JimmyCarter

It makes me happy that Carter has done well, but also bothers me that the media has all but abandoned the story of Carter's health, whereas we get updates whenever {% sfx ahem %} certain other former presidents do or say pretty much anything.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/110464130165172237)

 > So, it's one thing to say "there should be accountability," but when we think about and define "accountability" based on bad actors and bad deeds, part of our system of justice tells us that, yes, there should be serious, swift, and severe consequence, but also we must look to those who were harmed and ask, "Are we doing enough to allow them the ability to recover from that harm?"

I doubt that'll solve the overall problem, which has many other factors, but we still need to break this nonsense apart.

Good for them.  I hope they all rip each other apart, so that their conspiracy-mongering nonsense can crawl back into the shadows where it belongs.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I honestly probably would've guessed higher, but we should still probably fix this.
