This conversation has come up a couple of times, recently, originally as idle thoughts, so get ready for some unpopular opinions on intellectual property, as I try to put together a "permanent" version of my thoughts on it.  But here, I'll try to corral those ideas into another argument for Free Culture.  We can pretend that I wrote this to honor [Culture Freedom Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20120515063156/http://www.culturefreedomday.org/home/free-culture), yesterday, in a "draw the target around what I hit" kind of way.

![Our old friend C-Man running down an alley in pursuit of piracy](/blog/assets/c-man-running.png "We can't rightly speak well of copyrights without hauling out Free Culture's most prominent pro-copyright voice...")

Anyway, as I've surely mentioned before somewhere, I tend to believe that the Free Culture movement sabotaged its goals, starting in its earliest days, by aligning itself with copyright reformers and abolitionists, and my recent thinking about Free Culture has led to a lot of thinking about copyright.

## Quick History

About a year ago, I mentioned in a [post on the Free Culture movement]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}) that I can at least partially understand conflating the two movements.  Creative Commons has its origins in the controversies around music sharing-or-piracy on [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) and (unrelated) the [Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act), even though I think that it has caused us more harm than good.  Therefore, while they had the important "people could opt to share art like they do software" idea, they also had the far less interesting "we should have music that people can legally share on Napster" idea, hence the non-commercial and no-derivatives licenses, where you have permission to handle marketing or distribution on behalf of the artist, but don't dare try to make it your own.

It actually gets weirder.  In the decade prior to those controversies, the music industry began a series of lawsuits that still continue today, such as [*Grand Upright Music v Warner Bros Records*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc.), primarily targeting hip hop performers who used modified samples of older songs in their music without a copyright license.  Creative Commons tried to get involved in *that*, too, with a variety of sampling licenses that would give the audience permission to recycle small snippets of a song in another work.

## Going Wrong

And with that bit of history, I want to introduce the first problem with this philosophy of tying Free Culture to anti-copyright sentiment:  People predominantly share and remix mainstream, commercial, popular works, because people *know about them*.  Independent works, of the sort that the creator might make it available under the terms of a Free Culture or adjacent license, looks like a rounding error, if it exists at all.  Hip hop artists (I assume) didn't sit around researching bits of music that they should sample for songs; they chose from what they knew about[^1], so a public license that allows sampling doesn't make an impact, except to the people already sold on the concept of something like Free Culture.

[^1]:  Some quick research turns up that, in the early days, hip-hop artists had a fairly strict, if informal, honor code that they could only use classic music taken from the original vinyl, with a partial intent of drawing attention to the source.  If you think about the ramifications, it means that they would choose what a turntable-using DJ would have on hand, and by association, known enough that people would request it.

Similarly, the last couple of years have shown us that a lot of the complaints about longer copyright terms---I'll [complain about copyright](#not-that-copyright-doesnt-have-problems) later---have had little substance to them.  We heard for a quarter-century that extending copyright would massively stifle free expression, because we **needed** Mickey Mouse in the public domain.  When the copyrights on *Steamboat Willie* expired, they told us up through 2023, we would see a "flowering of creativity."  In a world where it takes less investment than ever to create and distribute a cartoon or much of anything else, we've seen plenty of not-quite-informed explainers on what people think you can do with Winnie-the-Pooh, Mickey Mouse, or others, but not much on the creative side[^2].  In the United States, the copyright on the final original Sherlock Holmes stories finally expired in 2023, I believe, but we've only seen characters from Arthur Conan Doyle's stories from the same people who successfully used the character *before* those last copyrights expired[^3].

[^2]:  OK, technically, we've seen a couple of *parodies*, such as the infamous horror films, which I find interesting, because a parody almost always qualifies as Fair Use, both highly transformative and using the original for criticism, rather than as competition for the original.  And because of that, those creators could've published the same parody in 2020, 1960, or 1930 without much risk.

[^3]:  In particular, the creator of CBS's **Watson**, Craig Sweeny, did a lot of the writing on CBS's **Elementary**.

Would it have gone down differently if *The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place*'s and **Winnie-the-Pooh**'s copyrights had expired in 2003 and *Steamboat Willie* in 2004 as expected prior to the Copyright Term Extension Act?  I tend to doubt it.  I don't even know if I believe that it would've mattered if the copyrights had expired decades sooner than that.  In fact, as I've said before, I strongly suspect that the attraction of these characters comes from the feeling of getting away with "stealing" an audience from Disney or another large corporation.  But to do that successfully, only creating a derivative work doesn't cut it.  You'd need to compete commercially with Disney, which costs a lot of money *and* carries the risk of violating trademark law as you---for example---use their corporate mascot in another context.

## Enforcing, Not Rewarding, Creativity

While I like the public domain as much as anybody---maybe more, given the amount of money that I spent in the late 1990s and early 2000s tracking down obscure books and stories with the hopes of extracting some weird character or other from them---I can't help getting the impression that copyright terms don't actually matter much[^9].  Every time that somebody insists that this next Public Domain Day will change the world, it flops, and they start talking about the next one[^4].

[^4]:  Actually, it occurs to me that even the various movements in this space don't really believe that copyright terms matter significantly.  I know this, because most of us believe, as somewhere between an article of faith and cherry-picked data, that copyright actually harms *commercial* projects.  [**It's a Wonderful Life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life) became a Christmas staple *not* because everybody loved it, but because its copyright lapsed in 1974 due to a clerical error, which meant that television stations could show it with much lower royalties relating only to the music, until the owners of the underlying story copyright argued that their copyright applied to the film, too.  Likewise, [**Night of the Living Dead**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead) might not have spread zombies throughout popular culture, had the distributor not deleted the film's copyright notice without replacing it.  If this holds true for more than a handful of anecdotes---and if we ignore the part of the idea where "wild success" means that people exploit art without compensating the artists---then it can't really matter how long you lock up media that we don't know about.

[^9]:  Since I originally published this post, a reader who does a lot of Free Culture and adjacent work pointed out to me that [copyright terms often matter most in music](https://mastodon.social/@hairylarry@gamerplus.org/114543928483783898), where that restricts what you can legally play/record on a budget, since it takes a particularly talented person to throw together a replacement song that has the same features that drew you to the original, as the post (later) talks about doing with stories.  I apologize for that clear oversight.

In fact, let's go a step further:  Assuming that you don't plan to defraud your audience by pretending that your work actually comes from a major studio or publisher, as in my hypothetical Mickey Mouse example, does a work's copyright protection *really* prevent you from creating your magnum opus?

I ask, because the aforementioned post on the Free Culture movement got me thinking a lot about negative liberties (the absence of restrictions) versus positive liberties (enabling and empowering people) in this space, and it occurs to me that copyright places *extremely* limited restrictions on us.  For example, Batman stories have a copyright, so we can't...well, copy them.  DC/Warner/Discovery has the art under copyright, so we can't create derivative works of Batman doing other things.  But copyright doesn't extend much further than that.  Nobody can copyright the idea of a billionaire playboy taking his frustrations out on underprivileged communities while hiding his identity in a fur-suit, though we might have more progressive politics recommending that we don't.  You can't use Batman himself, at least not for another decade when those copyrights start expiring.  Let me explain what I mean by way of an example, the basis of a hypothetical Batman story that doesn't rely on the Batman copyright.

> As sole scion of the wealthy Burke family, Dillon Burke returns to the city of Trivale to take control of Business Unit Resource and Knowledge Enterprises, the family business.  But the Burke heir hides a secret, that witnessing the murder of his parents as a child led him to become the Black Knight, a masked vigilante.  Leaving the day-to-day management of B.U.R.K.E. to trusted confederates, Dillon embarks on a nocturnal campaign targeting the city's clownish mobsters (including Don Pierrot), two-faced politicians (including city legislator Janus Doble), femme fatale cat-burglars (including Katherine Moone), and immortality-obsessed international crime-lords (including Professor Jenner Monde).

See?  OK, in the spirit of full disclosure, I cheated the *tiniest* bit, such as taking the Black Knight and Pierrot names from stock characters.  And more specifically, the Jenner Monde name comes from a "double disguise" in the first *Fu Manchu* novel, as in the implausible Asian crime-lord poses a Swedish professor posing as the crime-lord.  Even here, in other words, I couldn't help borrowing from the public domain to give this idea some superficial credibility.  But a Black Knight story would almost certainly pass muster, despite the transparent and deliberate mimicry of a more famous character.  Even if Dillon starts training his wise-cracking, acrobatic Red Squire, nobody has control over the ideas, only the expressions of those ideas.

And that makes me wonder if we have all gotten copyright wrong.  We think of it in terms of negative liberty---I can't publish a story where Frodo and Elrond open a restaurant, because the Tolkien estate would skin me alive, while the Tolkien estate can do whatever it wants with the characters, restricting my negative liberty so that they can have theirs---but maybe it involves some positive liberty, in that it encourages us to keep creating new expressions and variations on especially important or popular ideas.

### Examples

In fact, let's talk a bit about what popular culture we only have because significant copyright terms exist.

Do you want a quick example?  Imagine, if you will, the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  In the comics, a brilliant inventor who uses a wheelchair gathers together a handful of misfits to save a world that hates and fears them.  That probably sounds familiar to most of you as the [X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men), the sprawling comic book franchise that launched in September 1963[^5].  Except...that also describes the [Doom Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Patrol) from (as Marvel fans used to say) the Distinguished Competition in **June** 1963, three months looking almost precisely like the amount of time that it would've taken Stan Lee and Jack Kirby to get their idea from concept to the newsstands at the time.  Wait, though.  About a year later, DC seemed to like the X-Men innovation of having younger heroes band together, and later the familial aspects, so they launched the [Teen Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans), which they'd even later link to the Doom Patrol.  And hey, proving that you don't even need to change much to get away with these new versions, about twenty years later, Rob Liefeld launched [Youngblood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngblood_%28comics%29), mostly only changing the names from his **Teen Titans** pitch.

[^5]:  Release dates for comic books get weird, because they come from a combination of mail regulations, trying to skirt those regulations, and keeping books on shelves for as long as possible to minimize the number of copies that vendors take refunds for not selling.  As such, the specific release months probably happened earlier, but we only care about the difference, here.

Or we could talk about the many high-fantasy worlds that "take inspiration from" or "pay homage to"---by which I mean largely copy but file the serial numbers off the merchandise---[**The Lord of the Rings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), with [**Dungeons & Dragons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) surely the most persistent and famous of them.  Or we could talk about the probably *hundreds* of space opera stories that did and still do the same with [*Star Wars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars)---itself riffing on the original [Buck Rogers serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_%28serial%29), with some other influences---with [*Battlestar Galactica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica) probably the most popular.  We still get major motion pictures, though, whose scripts don't do much more than lightly remix elements of one of those two franchises.

Heck, speaking of Tolkien, I also can't go through this without talking about the more...problematic branch of the family.  Send some hobbits to a slightly modernized Dickensian boarding school and blend in ideas from other under-copyright British books, and you get the [*Harry Potter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) franchise.  If I remember correctly, [*Twilight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_%28novel_series%29) started its evolution as *Harry Potter* fan fiction, and [*Fifty Shades*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Shades_%28novel_series%29) started as *Twilight* fan fiction.

And don't forget about the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes.  With the enduring popularity of his adventures, we've had a consistent glut of Great Detectives, private (or amateur) investigators with an almost uncanny way of seeing the hidden truth of a situation.  They range from [transparent parodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin_versus_Herlock_Sholmes) to [looser pastiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Pons) to more [sincere variations of the archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Monk), not to mention all the "person who concludes everything from a quick glance" detectives across media.  At the start of the twentieth century, in fact, you can find many short stories---such as *The Adventure of the Clothes-Line* (1915) by Carolyn Wells---that mine humor out of all the detectives possibly teaming up on mundane cases, only to get in each other's way.

Parodies aside, we likely wouldn't have had many of these without copyrights preventing the adaptation of the property that inspired it.  And sure, a bunch of them *stink*, so you might not object to erasing [Hawkshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkshaw_the_Detective) from history; I found both incarnations of **Battlestar Galactica** absurdly tedious, myself.  But something in that set probably interests you, especially as the lower-hanging fruits get cordoned off by copyrights and creators try to find new directions.  I don't think that we'd feel better off if we only had people taking Tolkien (or *his* assorted influences), Buck Rogers, Sherlock Holmes, and the Doom Patrol in whatever directions they wanted.

Note that I can't find any evidence of *anybody* making this argument before, by the way, let alone as a covered-up or forgotten motivation for copyright laws.  In fact, all writing that I can find on implementing copyright laws hews to the (weirdly neoliberal) idea that, if you give us art, then society will let you control who can sell that art, markets everywhere.  I can find alternatives to copyright proposed, such as directly giving artists money or land for their work, and I can find people (mostly Thomas Jefferson) whining about how a temporary monopoly on art will become a slippery slope that sends us careening into a cyberpunk novel...not that he used those particular metaphors.  But everybody seems to agree that we use copyright as a lure to convince artists to create art, so that they can enforce copyright on it...even though everybody seems to also agree that artists make art no matter what.

As such, I don't dig into this argument to suggest that I've found some secret reasoning behind copyright, but rather that I might have found an overlooked value to it.

## Responsibility, Too

In the groove of thinking about copyright as a potential (if accidental) good, it also occurs to me that copyright also means that we not only *can* control what we create, but we also *must* control our work.  We talk about things "falling" into the public domain, and it feels a lot like how we (rightly) make fun of it when a company "goes open source" by [throwing something over the wall](https://opensource.com/business/16/9/how-to-open-source-your-software).  You can do whatever you want with it, but you now need to learn that it exists and find a use for it.

I can hear many of you rolling your eyes, but think about this seriously.  Project Gutenberg has tens of thousands of books without copyright protection, with some minimal organization such as their [bookshelves](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/) that you *probably* didn't know about, and I doubt that anybody knows how often they update those pages.  [Wikisource](https://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page) has an overlapping but distinct collection of millions[^6] of books.  The books that they host account for a *tiny minority* of books in the public domain, because scanning, transcribing, and proofreading books involves enormous amounts of labor.

[^6]:  Checking through their most common languages, they have over six hundred thousand English texts, almost six hundred thousand German, almost a hundred thousand in Spanish, four hundred thousand in French, two hundred thousand in Hebrew, two hundred thousand in Italian, two hundred thousand in Polish, six hundred thousand in Russian, one hundred thousand in Ukrainian, and almost five hundred thousand in Chinese, with at least another seventy languages represented.  I'd estimate somewhere in the neighborhood of six million books, total.

How many of those books do you know about?  How do you discover the texts in the public domain that most resonate with you?  Do you have any sources other than the usual sites?

I suspect that you see my point.  In many ways, works really do "fall" into the public domain, where they become part of an undifferentiated mass that nobody knows how to navigate.  If you find them, you can do anything that you want with them, but best of luck to you in finding anything that you didn't already know about.  Nobody has a material interest in getting you to read [**The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman**](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman), for example, so nobody will seriously recommend it to you.

Works under copyright get forgotten, too, but they do each have at least one champion in the author/artist/creator.  Where we forget those works, we do so because the creator doesn't have a strong enough voice in the culture, rather than because nobody cares.  That would take a *lot* of effort to fix, because big-name authors have the existing audience and help from their publishers in absorbing all the attention, but we at least know *how* to fix that problem.  But I don't know that anybody has ever proposed a plausible way of making the public domain discoverable, much less solved the problem for anything other than the already-most-popular works.

And the creator's responsibility for copyrighted works doesn't end with "selling" the work to people, though we could argue that it centers on it.  For example, to keep the work relevant, an author might revise a book and release new versions.  Or they might stop publishing it, if they change their minds and find it harmful.

Again, though, think of the works in the public domain *most celebrated* by people.  The works recently owned by the famous and powerful eclipse almost everything else.  We (pretend to) care about Mickey Mouse, because---as I noted earlier---it feels like we got to "steal" from Disney, not because anybody enjoys *Plane Crazy* or those other early cartoons.

Some people will object to this on the terms that the argument feels market-oriented and anti-cooperative, but remember that no less than [Frederick Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels) characterized [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) as saying "freedom is the recognition of responsibility" (or need), not to mention the [Committee of Public Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Public_Safety)'s insistence "that a great responsibility is the inseparable result of a great power," probably the source of the [spurious Voltaire attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility).  Taking responsibility for what you make feels like a core idea in any functioning world.

In that sense, copyright probably benefits us by making somebody the custodian of these works, rather than leaving them for "anybody"---meaning nobody, in practice---to deal with in a volunteer capacity, like a company producing "Open Source Software" by dumping a zip file on a server and shrugging their shoulders.

Again, I've never seen anybody make this argument, even to *defend* copyright, let alone as a rationale for the laws.  To the extent that it proves out, then, it does so accidentally, not by design.

## Who Cares

I'd call that a legitimate question.

Out of this conversation, I can see three possible directions of possible use.

First, acknowledging benefits in copyright, where they exist, makes us more credible critics of the system.  If I hate copyright because how *dare* Disney maintain its stranglehold on Mickey Mouse, then I show that I only care about negative freedom (avoiding restrictions), and to repeat myself, show that I probably don't actually care beyond talking points.  But if you point out that copyright has enabled this or that good thing, *and* we don't like that Disney maintains a stranglehold on increasing amounts of the culture, now that starts to sound like a legitimate argument.

Next, if we think about what good copyright can produce, then we can build our copyright laws, both new and updated, to focus on those benefits, rather than the abusive aspects that I'll talk about in a bit.  When we think about licenses---more on that, later, too---we can build new licenses so that they capitalize on the best aspects of copyright while working around the rest.

Finally, I think that this can help direct what little Free Culture movement that we have.  The massive flaws with generative AI exposed the uneasy philosophy at the core of a movement that combined opposition to copyright with an ethos of sharing, when we saw person after person opine something like "AI companies definitely shouldn't do this, but since we release material under public licenses written by people who oppose copyright, then shouldn't we also oppose copyright in all forms?"  And I think that anti-copyright stance has always made people *in the community* uncomfortable, because licenses don't work unless you have copyright; you can't *let* somebody do something, unless you have the authority to decide who gets permission.  If we can sever the link between sharing our work and opposing copyright on principle, that gives us more of a vision.

## Not that Copyright Doesn't Have Problems

I should mention that, despite my weird off-book ideas of benefits to copyright, I still bristle at the longer copyright terms.  No matter where this post ended up going, I don't see any value---to anybody other than the few large media corporation representing a significant fraction of the overall market---in cordoning off any art for multiple lifetimes.  For example, most of the world currently uses a Life+70 rule, the life of the author plus seventy years, as a copyright term, with the United States among the few countries that haven't made that rule retroactive.  In 2026 (next year), that means the public domain starts at creators who died in 1955; people who died in 1956 still have heirs who own their copyrights.  As an example of the absurdity, then, we could pick somebody along the lines of French composer [Gustave Charpentier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Charpentier) (1860--1956), whose first work **Didon**, published in 1887, still requires permission to use in a lot of the world.

We could probably find more extreme situations than a copyright lasting for a hundred thirty-four years, if we pick a jurisdiction such as Mexico (Life+100) and diligently search for long-lived artists who might not even rate a Wikipedia page.  In theory, in such a jurisdiction, the public domain will include the works of people who died in 1925 or earlier.  If those creators dying in 1926 lived for a hundred years and published something as a young adult, then that work could get a hundred eighty-two years of copyright.  A childhood doodle---unpublished, but those works traditionally have a Life+X copyright term anyway---could have a full *two centuries* of copyright protection.  And who even knows what you do, if we can't find convenient documentation of when an artist died...?

The copyright term should balance neatly against the benefit that the culture receives, because we also need the benefit of making these properties available, *in case* people figure out how to use them for something new.

That doesn't even get to how copyright interacts with unregulated capitalism, where market concentration and the ability to sell copyright (or cede it as a "work for hire") combine to funnel control over franchises to a handful of companies that only care about using those works to shovel your attention (and money) in their direction.

We also might as well talk about the massive flaws in how people and companies have abused copyright for neocolonial purposes, too.  In brief, so that I don't overstep my knowledge on the subject, copyright tends to not cover things that Western business cultures haven't traditionally cared about, so people can feel free to lift rhythms for songs or aspects of performances, but not melodies.  But people can also copyright "fixed forms" of these copyright-free aspects, giving that company control of, for example, somebody else's family stories.

That last sounds like a hypothetical example, but the Lakota people currently face a situation where [a company claims copyright on learning materials](https://walledculture.org/how-can-you-save-a-dying-language-when-copyright-lets-somebody-own-its-key-learning-materials/) gathered from existing Lakota speakers, including---not mentioned by this particular article---family stories.  And they enforce that copyright against---in a major ongoing legal battle[^7]---the exact families who gave them the information that they turned into a commodity.

[^7]:  Not under a Free Culture license, but NPR's **Code Switch** has an [episode on the Lakota legal fight](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/1245044444/lakota-language-consortium-preservation) that fleshes out the shorter article.

And don't forget how, parallel to how we've conflated Free Culture with anti-copyright sentiment, the twenty-first century managed to conflate copyright with [opposition to breaking encryption](https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/14/pregnable/#checkm8).

## Back to Free Culture

Putting all this together, I think, makes a fairly good argument for Free Culture, both as a general concept and as a practice.  Free Culture retains the benefits of copyright---the custodianship of works and the encouragement to make more---but also actively seeks involvement, by selecting a public license that says that you can use this work *if* you agree to share in the custodial duties.

It reminds me of the older idea that, no matter how much humanity tries, we only really have two forms of governance in the world, democracy and oligarchy.  You might believe that you can have a dictatorship, but the dictator will eventually need to share power to function, either with lieutenants---who will inevitably mediate and filter between the leader and the people to amass power of their own---or with the people at large.  You might think that you can have an anarchic society, but either you set up accountable structures that enforce equality, or warlords start carving up the territory.  Everything else transitions to one of those two states, rather than surviving on their own.

Similarly, I've also pointed out repeatedly over the years that [democracy has become the only viable form of governance]({% post_url 2021-05-30-winning %}), with alternatives either having lifespans around that of a pet rodent or requiring constant, *massive* infusions of cash.

Those feel like relevant analogies, here.  The public domain epitomizes anarchy, in that it has nobody with official power, and it predictably becomes a space where big corporations play, not because anybody keeps the rest of us out, but because they have the resources to find what they want, develop it, and to drown out any competition.  For the rest of us, our window into the public domain only shows us what everybody else talks about, a different kind of concentration of power, around a handful of dead authors and artists.  And even among that "rest of us," you can quickly see that aspiring-warlord behavior arise, as people talk about how much they love the public domain, ask for works in the public domain that meet their extremely specific parameters, so that they can use it for a project, and then try to sell you access to their under-copyright work[^8].

[^8]:  I've probably mentioned before that I walked away from a lot of communities that focused on public domain works specifically because of this obsession with enclosure.  They love their anarchy, but not after they have property to defend.  I most commonly see this today on social media, where people have various hashtags to the effect of "made with Free Software" or "using public domain materials," as if it makes them progressive to have exploited the community with little interest in giving back beyond letting people *see* their work.

On the other side, we have the aforementioned copyrights with unregulated markets, where you have full control over your work *in theory*, but in practice, you can probably only get any mileage out of your strict control by giving a lot of that power over to...well, a fairly literal oligarch.  Either that, or you give up on enforcing your copyright, and end up in that previous paragraph.

Free Culture gives us that equivalent to democracy, the opposite pole from copyright's oligarchies.  You still have ultimate responsibility for your work, but people have an invitation to join in carrying out those responsibilities.  And *maybe* we should start treating it that way, instead of an appendage to a movement that incorrectly believed that we'd all put Mickey Mouse in our projects once the cartoon copyrights lapsed.
