Today is [World Teachers Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Teachers%27_Day), meant to bring attention to how teachers affect students and society.

At a time when a large segment of the population considers itself directly opposed to teachers---trying to destroy collective bargaining, ignoring that they're buying classroom supplies out-of-pocket, and accusing them of brainwashing---and many local governments are pushing teachers back into poorly ventilated, crowded classrooms to pretend that there isn't a pandemic, it seems like a good time to have some sense of what teachers really do.

It's also [Child Health Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Health_Day), [World Architecture Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Architecture_Association), and [World Habitat Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Habitat_Day).  Is it a coincidence that I was just talking about a health crisis (that affects children directly and indirectly) and architecture?  Probably, but there's a connection, regardless.

## Entropy Arbitrage

I found some bugs in the scripts I use to maintain the blog.  I keep forgetting that Linux command shells generally interpret numbers with leading zeroes as implicitly octal (base-8), which doesn't manifest itself when there aren't any digits greater than seven.  When dealing with calendars, that reliably means that there are plenty of days in a month when things go wrong, *but* only two days (the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>) in a month when an error might trigger.  With any luck, that doesn't mean that I have months of bad posts.

## Seeking Refuge

I'm continued with the light editing for [the novel]({% post_url 2019-12-14-seeking-refuge %}).  Not much to be said, there, but it's nice revisiting at least parts of the story.  However, I'm less pleased seeing that I have such consistent verbal tics.

## Next

Mostly, just copy [last week]({% post_url 2020-09-14-democracy %})'s upcoming tasks to this week, since this week didn't accomplish much of substance.  Or, rather, note those quietly, because I suspect that I'll continue editing **Seeking Refuge** as I work on getting that other project running, since there's only about a week's worth of work left, there.
