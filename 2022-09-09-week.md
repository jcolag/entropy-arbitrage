As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The recent spike in unionization efforts comes from employees in the airline, retail and tech industries seeking a stronger voice in the workplace.

I realize that Biden has tied his identity to unions since the early days of his career, so this shouldn't surprise me, but it still gratifies me to see the United States government agencies openly voicing support for organized labor, instead of pretending to not have a position on the issue.

 > The growth of Nollywood has made way for a new Nigerian Cinema with filmmakers dedicated to “creating films that tell stories about Africa and are made in Africa by Africans”...

I need to start watching Nollywood, at some point.  I consider my brief flirtations with Bollywood highly successful, even though that habit didn't stick, but I love seeing how the rest of the world sees their part of the world.

 > Teachers, parents, and community members can all assist at-risk youth by celebrating their individuality, Rose says.

I don't think I've had more arguments on any topic than "what constitutes bullying."  Despite many friends assuring me that bullies exclusively use physical violence, my experience doesn't reflect that at all, to the extent that I can't think of a single instance of physical bullying at school.

 > ...during the 2020 election, Florida voters who lived in counties where the county supervisor of elections shared information...were more likely to complete the voter registration process and use online voter registration.

Sadly, it qualifies as headline news to say that informing people of voting procedures increases the chances of their participation in democracy.  You would almost think that the country has undergone a decades-long, systemic campaign to eradicate civics lessons from the country, and that we can fight back against them by simply telling people how to vote...

 > Polling in the state showed that 77 percent of Nebraskans backed the initiative, but they never got the chance to show their support at the polls.

Personally, I don't care about marijuana (as such) either way.  However, even I can see that we demonize the drug so that we can round up (non-white) kids and keep them in prison.  Racists, then, will do whatever they can to keep people from voicing their opinions on the topic, so that they don't suddenly have a groundswell of voters---previously oppressed by them, no less---to oppose them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [diaspora's 10 years in community hands](https://blog.diasporafoundation.org/74-diaspora-s-10-years-in-community-hands) from the diaspora* Blog

 > We’ve also stabilized performance in many ways, and we've added many improvements to the user interface and new features.

What a happy anniversary.  I can still remember this starting out as a Kickstarter project that didn't seem like it had much chance of pulling itself together.  Since then, the project has lost one of its founders, built community control to replace all the founders, and grown significantly for ten years.

It still doesn't have the best community, but it has still succeeded far beyond my expectations when I saw---and probably laughed at, if you want complete honesty---the Kickstarter campaign.
