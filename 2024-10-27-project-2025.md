* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

I want to make this post (relatively) quick, since I---along with everyone else, I imagine---have hit a point of exhaustion with the 2024 election.  But, as this post goes out with about a week and a half left before Election Day, I wanted to pass a few items along.

![An old-style voting booth, with a large red lever used to submit your votes with a satisfying sound](/blog/assets/292259730_5037c2d747_o.png "Honestly, half my decision to vote absentee in elections probably comes from how the lower budgets of the privacy screens make the actual process of voting indistinguishable from filling out the oversized Scantron test at home...")

This, as you can probably guess by my telling you when to expect Election Day, focuses on the United States, but those of you who live elsewhere might want to check some of the other links, since they talk about ideas that might land in your town soon enough...

## Vote

First, if you haven't voted yet and can, go do that, will you?  If you don't live in Alabama, Mississippi, or New Hampshire, then [you can vote early](https://www.usa.gov/early-voting).  You know how, every four years, we decry how the United States still hasn't made Election Day a national holiday and/or how people in some areas need to wait on long lines to vote?  Solve the first problem by voting before Election Day.  Solve the second problem by getting out of the way of people who needed to wait until Election Day to vote...by voting before Election Day.  If you read this when it goes out, then you can probably vote today and next weekend, assuming that you can't conveniently get them to send you an absentee ballot at this point.

If you don't *want* to vote, for whatever reason, go on behalf of somebody who can't, because democracy makes a lot more sense as a team sport.

## Polls

Next, ignore the polls.  I can't find the podcast where the interviewee mentioned it, but one of the most chilling stories that I've heard, recently, had to do with an incidental comment (rather than the topic, making it even harder to find the thing), where the journalist-subject, talking about issue polls, made a passing and almost-irrelevant mention that they try to frame questions in such a way that *they get close to a fifty-fifty split* in responses, because that seems more interesting.

I don't know if they do the same for political polls, but in thinking about horse-race political coverage, not only would such a policy amplify the audience's stress to keep them engaged---all ad-supported media exists primarily to get you to pay attention to the ads, remember---but it also serves the interests of the major candidates, who can campaign on a tight race.  But poll numbers don't equate to votes, and polls have gotten the answers wrong a *lot*, over the last years...

## Project 2025

Then, for those of you who haven't seen it[^1], a team of comic book creators launched [Stop Project 2025](https://stopproject2025comic.org/), a series of short comics that each takes on a specific topic in the [Project 2025 initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) poised to guide Republican politicians going forward.  You (trust me on this) don't want to slog through almost a thousand pages of contradictory rambling, so let the writers and artists do the heavy lifting for you and follow the citations when you need them.  And they made it all available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution No-Derivatives 4.0 International license, closely adjacent to---but distinct from, for legitimate reasons---Free Culture.

[^1]:  In writing this post mostly last night, I didn't have time to ask the person who introduced me to the comics if they wanted credit for doing so.  I'll add such credit later, if they do.  If you read this, and it sounds like I might mean you, reach out in case I forget to ask...

If you don't know where to start, I might recommend [Libraries](https://stopproject2025comic.org/comic/libraries/), since I assume that people who read blogs also understand how public libraries work and like them.  They do a good job of establishing the stakes and methods, and do it far more elegantly than any of the podcasts that I've listened to trying to tackle the document.

Related, you might want confirmation that Trump's language has become [more violent and more direct](https://theconversation.com/we-analyzed-9-years-of-trump-political-speeches-and-his-violent-rhetoric-has-increased-dramatically-238962), escalating consistently, and currently "approximating that of authoritarian figures such as Kim Jong-un and Fidel Castro."

## Patriotism

In the context of violent rhetoric "othering" large numbers of Americans and attempts to alter almost everything about the government, I feel like I should make a point that I've made elsewhere in other contexts:  We have a political party that always strives to claim the mantle of "patriot."  And I need to ask a quick question about that, and considered building an entire post about the question with plenty of citations.

What country do they feel that patriotism *for*?

I mean, if they hate millions of Americans---gender and sexual minorities, non-white people, non-Christians, poor people, protestors, whistle-blowers, and more---the country's laws, and its core philosophies, then what do they have left to like?  I contend that their patriotism amounts to nothing more than real estate fan fiction.  And if I could demand anything of journalists, I'd demand that they ask every chest-pounding politician who they interview what country they have in mind.

## Vote Like an Adult, I Meant

After that, for those of you trying to figure out some optimized Game Theory approach to voting...

 * Stop trying to make your vote about *you*, and realize that we have actual human lives at stake.
 * Check out [*5 ways to approach the election with a movement mindset*](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/10/5-ways-to-approach-the-election-with-a-movement-mindset/).

Of particular note, the author points out that "things need to get worse to make people up" doesn't actually fit history *at all*.  We move forward by compounding small changes and capitalizing on hope, not spending time working to protect people who we put at risk.  Anybody telling you otherwise might have gotten their talking points from somebody who doesn't actually want progress, similar to how that has happened in every election for at least a quarter-century.

By the way, I don't fully agree with the article, taking issue with its vague complaints about the two-party system.  While I don't love it, I know that the solution lies in focusing on moving local races and building from there, not trying to take the White House without any preparation.  Think about it in terms of the [REDMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP) project, not [**Brewster's Millions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster%27s_Millions_%281985_film%29)[^2]...

[^2]:  Saving you younger folks the trouble of figuring out which part that I meant, in the 1985 adaptation, Richard Pryor's character runs an accidentally popular protest campaign for "none of the above" as mayor of New York City.  Too much discourse around third parties revolves around a belief that the people will get so disgusted at the mainstream candidates that they'll spontaneously all take your guy seriously, which works in politics about as often as it works in getting people to abandon shopping at Amazon for more local options.

## It Never Ends

I should mention, by the way, that parallel to my description of voting as a "team sport" above, the game also never actually ends.  We keep making this mistake, that you vote once and fix the country.  But we have centuries of accumulated problems to fix, and a dedicated minority---propped up, as everywhere else in the world, primarily by oil money---that wants to undo all progress that we've made.

Yes, it feels better to laugh *with* the protestor who uses a slogan of "I can't believe that I still need to protest this," but they need to do it because so many people bought into the idea of "the end of history" after the fall of the Soviet Union.  Democracy won, they told us, and so we shouldn't have any problems in the future.  And that...didn't turn out well at all.

Likewise, while many patted themselves on the back for our "post-racial society" for electing Barack Obama, go re-read that REDMAP article again, and also check out the people behind the Tea Party movement.

Vote now, then prepare to continue voting strategically for the rest of your life, and to instill that ethic in the people who come after you.

## Seriously, Go Vote

I don't want to tell you who to vote for, though you can probably guess who I'd rather have handling crises and protests, in contrast to who I'd rather have losing track of their hateful speeches and trying to cover it by dancing on stage for half an hour.  But I did want to draw attention to at least the comics and the "movement mindset" article, not to mention strongly suggesting that you vote.  And maybe get other people out there, whether physically doing it on your own, nagging people (not unlike this blog post), or donating to groups that provide ride-shares or food to voters.
