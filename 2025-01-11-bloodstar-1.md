* Ignore for ToC

This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**, from *Acclaim The Sun* to *Inquiring For Support*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Blood of the Ancient Star**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov/bloodstar>
 * Released:  2021
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  [Kerkenov](https://codeberg.org/Kerkenov)
 * Medium:  Novella
 * Length:  Approximately thirty thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Animal death, violence, ableist language

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Blood of the Ancient Star

Sadly, I can't find any more information on the project than this.

 > It's an open source novel you can contribute to.

I can't even find the full name of the author, only a Microsoft Word file and the MIT license.

## What Works Well?

While I don't particularly *enjoy* reading through it, the book feels mildly refreshing in how the characters need to actually take care of logistics as they travel.  Do I personally want to know about the economics of peddling fur hats in order to survive on the road?  No.  Can I appreciate that the story has thought it through?  Sure.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

This book could use a serious edit, unfortunately.  While a lot of the prose seems fine, it occasionally lapses into...something else.  Take an example from near the start of the book.

 > "What simply occurred," Chloe asked herself so anyone can hear.

A line like this could result from a poor/literal translation from another language[^1], a poor grasp on English, or any number of other sources, but some of this seems so far outside narrative English use that I can't even guess the intent.  In less-extreme cases, such as the example above, we can work out the intended meaning by working out the correct synonym.

[^1]:  The peculiar diction and rhythms actually remind me a lot of projects where an author will write in native English, then translate through a variety of languages and *back* to English, in order to camouflage their writing style.  But that only really works if you then proofread the final translation to squeeze out the nonsensical parts.

In terms of coarser-grain edits, we run into a problem that we've seen in quite a few Free Culture works, now, where the characters will stop the forward momentum periodically to recount the story so far for a new character, as if *we* might have skipped past the first few iterations.

## Opportunities

The book has a repository on Codeberg, but nobody has touched that repository in three years, and the author doesn't have any other projects that might indicate whether they might have an interest in the solicited contributions.

## What's Adaptable?

Other than the characters and the broad setting of---I assume, based on the context---Ancient Greece under the Roman Republic, I don't see anything named.  Even the city that we spend most of the section in actively goes unnamed, an empty underline wherever the name should show up.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading **Blood of the Ancient Star**, from *The Moon Strikes Once More* to *A Road To A New Life*.  If you reach *A New Safe Haven*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
