As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...left the agency without the authority to hold major telecom monopolies like AT&T and Comcast accountable during an historic public health crisis.

Good riddance.  Remember, he also pulled the plug on the comment site, claiming that it was being attacked, only to admit that he lied *after* making his decision.

 > ...approximately 40% of female adolescents in emergency settings have experienced some form of intimate partner violence...

What's concerning is that the calling out of intimate partner violence, to me, signals that this might be a case where the emergency gives the victims an opportunity to voice what is happening in ordinary conditions, rather than a situation created by the crisis.

 > Of those, 15 businesses either kept only one job, kept no jobs, or offered no update on job retainment.

This has been a trademark of corporate bailouts for decades:  The companies beg the government for money, citing impending layoffs if they don't get the money, essentially holding the employees for ransom.  Then, they refuse to accept the money if there are any conditions attached.  Finally, they take the money and enact their layoffs, anyway.

It's long past time that we stop doing business this way.

 > ...Pinkerton agents were actually the private armies for the rich industrial titans of the Gilded Age, helping union bust and infiltrate workers groups.

This is obviously a dangerous and horrific situation, but it's also worth taking a step back to realize that the richest man in the world heads up an organization that is *terrified* of its labor force working together to push back against exploitation.  That is not the position a person takes from a place of strength, and shows how fragile the Amazon empire really is.

 > Thompson nonetheless opened fire on Trawick, first with a Taser and then with a gun, killing Trawick.

Activity like this is why people are increasingly convinced that the only solution to police violence is to abolish the police in general.  Every time police departments have a chance to show that they're not the corrupt racists they're accused of being, they make a show of investigating themselves and ignoring evidence to claim that everything is fine.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth and seventh article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The case for cookie-cutter buildings](https://www.fastcompany.com/90581254/the-case-for-cookie-cutter-buildings?partner=feedburner) from Fast Company

 > ...buildings can be built faster, using materials that reduce or even sequester carbon.

The article goes on to point out that it's hard to standardize construction, but it's worth considering that standardization is generally not good, since weather and hazards vary wildly from city to city.  Still, it's an interesting idea.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Talking to babies may change their brains](https://www.futurity.org/talking-to-babies-brain-development-2482122-2/) from Futurity

 > ...babies who engaged in more conversations with adults in their everyday lives had less synchronized activation in a network of regions that processes language stimulation.

I admit that I don't know enough about neuroscience to understand the implications of this finding, but more stimulation leading to less effect seems interesting.
