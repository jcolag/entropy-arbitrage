## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *star-trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Inner Light

The episode title presumably takes its name from [the Beatles song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inner_Light_%28song%29), which admittedly feels thematically appropriate.  Otherwise, I'll skip past the jargon and minor appearance by Nurse Ogawa, since the episode puts its focus purely on the alien culture.

 > **PICARD**: This is not my life! I know that much.

You'll notice---especially since we don't really have anything else to do, here---that Picard confronts everybody angrily, demanding that they treat him with the respect he feels due, without ever *once* telling them about himself.  He seems to think that anger works as the universal language...

I don't mean to suggest that he should tell them about the Federation (though he already mentioned it, and announces it more thoroughly in a deleted scene) or anything, but giving them a name and a sense that he feels like he lived another life would go a much longer way to getting him some sympathy.

 > **ELINE**: You've been dreaming of that starship of yours again, haven't you?

Did Picard try to casually violate the Prime Directive?  It feels like he decided that assimilation includes telling everybody about interstellar travel.

 > **BATAI**: You've been brooding behind that flute all evening.

And *Frère Jacques*, no less, rather than learning something local, maybe as a callback to [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}), but probably not.

 > **ELINE**: Kamin, you've built your telescope, your laboratory. You don't need my permission for something new.

I believe that she suggested that he took over half the house *without* asking...

 > **RIKER**: Then we should be able to send out a probe of our own, trace it back to the origin.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I'll get right on it.

Once again, either Riker gives orders that everybody should have already guessed, *or* La Forge sat around waiting for somebody to give him instructions.

 > **PICARD**: We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. But now his memory will live on in his namesake.

Unrelated to our general project, I wish that they would've given this ceremony more emotional resonance with almost anything, because the music that he plays will go on to have many lives (so many orchestral arrangements, starting with the thirtieth anniversary album, I believe, though this arrangement appears on the fourth soundtrack album for the show), even becoming something of Picard's theme---literally, in some parts of **Picard** the show---but seeing the moment where it appears falls flat, feeling more like something learnable than something important...

Oh, also, you might note the similarity to [*The Skye Boat Song*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Skye_Boat_Song) and its predecessors, which has gotten some time in early **Doctor Who**, with a reprise in the latest season/series...and it genuinely bothers me that I know all that, a clear sign of my misspent youth.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future.

Somebody sure does have a high opinion of himself...

By the way, can I make the point of how much this confirms my "white guys in blazers" theory of **TNG** politics?  This alien culture has, in effect, captured Picard and altered his mind to force him to live as one of them---subjectively for an entire lifetime, even suffering through dementia---to have him serve as their emissary to the Federation.  Doesn't that seem *familiar* to anybody?  It seems to me that the Borg did exactly this, only with clumsier technology (and less-classy wardrobe), but one version represents the height of villainy in this universe, leading to a decades-long quest for vengeance, and the other becomes something that Picard immediately cherishes.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we don't get much out of the episode, because it has other priorities.

### The Bad

Picard and Riker each show some need to make demands of people without really providing anything of substance.

Picard also appears to have tried to violate the Prime Directive by encouraging an unknown civilization to explore space.

## Next

Come back next week, when Data tries to get a head, leading the crew to hang out with Mark Twain in *Time's Arrow*, part 1.
