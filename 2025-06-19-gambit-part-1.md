## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Gambit part 1

We'll skip a lot of this early bit, since they seem to imply that this "Definitely Not *Star Wars*" bar sits outside the Federation.

Meanwhile, over on **DS9**, the crew needs to fend off a takeover by the local extremists while evacuating civilians in *The Siege*.

 > **WORF**: Commander, I told---

Yeah, don't bother listening to the security officer.

 > **YRANAC**: Family honor is important. If someone had defiled my sister I would do anything, pay anything, to find the one responsible.

The crew certainly feels comfortable playing into the heteronormative and misogynist idea that families need to defend the alleged "purity" of a woman.

Unrelated and largely irrelevant, in addition to the lazy writing with people telling us once again to find Troi attractive, they seem to have named this character "canary" (spelled backwards), as in [sing like a...](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sing_like_a_canary).

 > **YRANAC**: As much as five bars of gold-pressed latinum.

Over on **Deep Space Nine**, they introduced this as a currency preferred by Ferengi.

 > **RIKER**: This is my sister. She's angry. She's got a vicious temper. I wouldn't cross her.

Never forget that nobody in this universe likes the idea that Crusher has a backbone of her own and doesn't do everybody's emotional labor for them.

 > Acting Captain's log, stardate 47135.2. Doctor Crusher has positively identified Captain Picard's DNA. There's no doubt now that he's dead.

Don't get my hopes up, episode...

 > **RIKER**: I think you'd be better at something like that. Or Beverly. She knew him the longest.

Notice how, despite their apparent worship of Picard, they all fight to avoid eulogizing him.  I wonder how much this has to do with their dismissal of grieving---which Riker will bring up---and how much of it comes from nobody really *liking* the captain.

 > **RIKER**: I have an open wound, right here. It hurts like hell. I don't want it to get better, and I don't want to pretend that everything's all right.

Thousands of colleagues die in random episodes, and they shake it off to continue their missions.  Friends die in front of them, and they reprimand one another to prove that they can perform stoicism the best.  But when the *boss* dies, they can't control their emotions.

 > **RIKER**: I know that, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in the authorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe that they're corrupt.

Oh, we have a new reason to dismiss local sovereignty, somewhat ironic, given how often we've seen this crew pull the "how about you walk away so that I can do my crimes in public and erase the logs" trick.

 > **CHEKOTE**: All right, Commander. I'm officially placing the Enterprise on detached duty. Your mission is at your discretion. Good luck.

For an example of corruption, an admiral gave Riker full discretion to horn in on an investigation outside Federation jurisdiction.

Oh, and you probably don't recognize Chekote as [Bruce Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Gray), but since the character debuted about a week before in **DS9**'s *The Circle*, it seemed worth mentioning him.

 > **RIKER**: If you're lucky, you'll only spend the next five years in prison instead of the next twenty. You've got twelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in the Klingon Empire. Tell me what you know, and I'll pull some strings. Maybe they'll reduce your sentence after you've been extradited.

To recap their relationship with Yranac, they lied about their motivations for wanting to know what happened to Picard, offered him transportation in exchange for his information, and now want to extort more information from him by threatening to sell him out to what sounds like an abusive law enforcement regime.

 > **DATA**: I realize that, sir. But if he were, and he wanted to lead an away team, you would tell him that the Captain's place is---
 >
 > **RIKER**: On the Bridge. Not this time.

Now that the rules affect *him*, we have to drop them.  Sorry...

 > **GIUSTI**: Commander, we've lost contact with the away team.

Despite her small role, here, you might recognize the ensign as [Sabrina LeBeauf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_LeBeauf), probably really only known for playing Sondra Huxtable on **The Cosby Show**---back in the days when we pretended that we shouldn't avoid talking about Bill Cosby---but also significantly more famous at the time than *anybody* else in the episode.

 > **LAFORGE**: Data, we've been attacked. We've got one casualty and Commander Riker has been taken captive.

I notice that La Forge omits how they aimed specifically for that casualty despite much clearer targets than the crouching person.  It almost seems disappointing that, with all the things that this franchise has spent time unnecessarily explaining (and sometimes re-explaining) to us over the years, we never got some revelation that "disposable" characters like this somehow became targets of the shooters because of some old feud or whatever.

Also, we dumped Picard *and* Riker?  And this show didn't get an eighth season...?

Yeah, I know it doesn't stick.

 > **BARAN**: What's the problem?

If Baran looks familiar, you might recognize him as [Richard Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lynch), who I feel like probably made an entire career of playing petty villains.

 > **VEKOR**: This is a waste of time, Baran. Get rid of him now.

And if Vekor looks familiar, you might recognize *her* as [Caitlin Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Caitlin_Brown), who among other things had a decent run as Na'Toth---which had already started, I believe---on competing **Babylon 5**.

 > **PICARD**: They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now.

For a man who obsesses over playing poker, I can't help noticing that Riker has a *terrible* poker face.  His gaping should have gotten them both killed.  Ordinarily, I might not even bring it up since they tried to set the episode-so-far up as some sort of emotional roller coaster, but the fact that Riker put on such a big show of only reporting his name, rank, and serial number, draws so much attention to this lapse of discipline when it would actually count.

Incidentally, the "name, rank, and serial number" tradition actually comes from the duties assigned to prisoners of war by the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Geneva_Convention#Part_III:_Captivity).  I'd point out that it seems weird that Riker would rely on such protocols when he definitely doesn't qualify as a prisoner of war, here, but he also failed by omitting his date of birth, so we can call it a wash...

 > **BARAN**: I don't need a consensus to run this ship, Galen.

And Picard, notably, takes his alias from his mentor who we met in [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}), who Picard talked about there as his surrogate father.

 > **PICARD**: Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history of insubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during the Cardassian incident at Minos Korva.

He probably means Jellico sidelining Riker during [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-30-chain-command-2 %}) for repeatedly insisting on taking up a rogue mission without nearly enough information to complete it successfully.

 > **TALLERA**: Watch him.

And you probably *should* recognize Tallera---and a future alias next week---as [Robin Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Curtis), who played Saavik in [**The Search for Spock**]({% post_url 2022-03-31-tsfs %}).

 > **DATA**: These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is an ancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where Captain Picard was killed were also Romulan in origin.

First off, how ancient an offshoot can you have, given that the Romulans broke from the Vulcans at some point after the Vulcans had interstellar space travel?

Second, sure, why not blame the Romulans for everything?  Their own captain lifted artifacts from an archaeological site that he considered "important" in [*Rascals*]({% post_url 2025-01-02-rascals %}), but surely the official enemies must've done it when they don't approve of the theft.

 > **PICARD**: I convinced them I was a smuggler, and that my name was Galen. I offered to help them appraise the artifacts that they had stolen. Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artifacts from archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has me analyzing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will, they are looking for a specific artifact.

Legally speaking, [smuggling](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smuggle) refers to importing or exporting goods without paying the relevant price to the government or otherwise defying the law.  I assume that means that Picard doesn't qualify as a smuggler only because he doesn't leave his collection behind when he crosses borders...

 > **PICARD**: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't have that control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation.

And yet Data in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}) and Troi in [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}), not to mention the routine bullying that Picard and Riker engage in, all point to leadership in the Federation working exactly the same way, minus the pain implant things.

 > **RIKER**: I'm your commanding officer. I'm giving you a direct order. Understood?

I definitely don't understand.  Does he still qualify as a commanding officer while captured by some random smugglers...?

 > **DATA**: Mister Worf, that is an order.

Remember, people only treat you like a leader in this version of Starfleet if you bully your reports instead of earning respect.  How did Picard put it?  Right, "based on fear and intimidation."

## Conclusions

We get some minor mileage out of this one.

### The Bad

We see the usual assortment of racism.  They ignore everything that Worf has to say.  Riker threatens a foreign national with police violence.  Nobody respects local governments.  And they blame the Romulans for everything again.  Likewise, we see more than a little sexism, both playing into the idea that men have some duty to police the sexual "purity" of their female relatives and the continued maligning of Crusher as insufficiently friendly.

This episode also shows some direct effects from the culture's irrational suppression of emotions that arise during grieving, with Riker in particular simultaneously lashing out at people and trying to hide from actual responsibilities that might bring closure.  This also seems to tie to their authoritarian tendencies, with grief over losing a boss significantly outweighing all similar incidents that we've seen previously.

Starfleet has no concerns about sending officers to interfere with investigations by foreign governments, in the pretext that that government might do something even more corrupt.  Riker likewise dismisses rules that he previously enforced, when it might affect him.

While people understand that you can't sustain leadership through intimidation, they still try to lead that way.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when...well, we wrap this mess up in *Gambit*, part 2.
