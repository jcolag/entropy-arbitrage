In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Attached

Since last time, the crew over on **DS9** gets introduced to the political situation on the other side of their wormhole, while also undermining some sexist stereotypes, in *Rules of Acquisition*.

Meanwhile, this episode?  Let's try to get it over with...

 > **PICARD**: No. I'm really sorry. I don't.

Not only does Picard abuse his authority to get his employees to hang out with him, but when they do, he can't even trouble himself to pay attention to them for a few minutes.

 > **CRUSHER**: I've been telling you about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign Markson for the last fifteen minutes.

Hey, Ogawa still exists...

 > **PICARD**: Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, and that unity said something about them. That they had resolved certain social and political differences, and they were now ready to become part of a larger community.

Remember that, only two episodes ago, [*Gambit*]({% post_url 2025-06-26-gambit-part-2 %}) ended by assuring us that the Vulcans arrested everybody involved in their isolationist movement, while hinting that some wanted to dismiss it as a foreign plot.  When Picard says "resolved certain social and political differences," does he mean outlawing dissent?  I'd guess so, since he mentioned an expedition to find "renegade Andorians" in [*The Survivors*]({% post_url 2023-05-18-survivors %}).

 > **CRUSHER**: Well, think about Earth. What if one of the old nation states, say Australia, had decided not to join the world government in twenty-one fifty? Would that have disqualified us as a Federation member?
 >
 > **PICARD**: That analogy is not exactly---

We get some history, here, worth comparing to Troi's mention of the founding of the Federation in 2161 during [*The Outcast*]({% post_url 2024-09-05-outcast %}).  Did they call it United Earth, the term suggested in [*Tomorrow Is Yesterday*]({% post_url 2020-05-21-tmrw %}) and Q implied looked like a failed movement in 2079 during [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %})?  Various episodes have hinted that the United Earth existed in some form long before that, but 2150 presumably marks when the last country signs on.

As for Picard's objection, while I don't believe that we've established the founding members of the Federation except for the aforementioned *Gambit* putting Vulcan on the list, we can probably assume that Earth led the movement, given that we've only ever seen high-level government facilities on Earth, and [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-11-09-best-both-worlds-part-2 %}) strongly suggested that "sector zero-zero-one" meant Earth.

Picard might, then, see this as a poor analogy because whatever founders show up would've (by definition) founded the Federation, with no rules.  That seems fairly consistent for Picard, who frequently argues for a kind of Federation Exceptionalism where he has problems with *other* cultures doing exactly the sorts of things that we see them do regularly.

Also...Australia?  Surely, two better options existed for the line.  First, the United States has a *long* history of helping to set up important international institutions, only to fake-cough on the phone at the last minute to explain why we can't actually participate.  Second, from the perspective of needling Picard---the only person who we've seen who cares about the country of his ancestors---on the topic, you can't have a more appropriate final hold-out than France.

 > **CRUSHER**: Wait until tomorrow. I have something very special planned. It's a Vulcan dish. That's all I'll say.

And Picard rolls his eyes at this, because how *dare* anybody offer him new foods?

 > **LORIN**: We're not fools. We are aware of the Federation attempt to establish a military alliance with the Kes. It will not be tolerated.

Ah, the Federation's wonderful reputation strikes again...

 > **DATA**: A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor beam. It might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set of coordinates.

Every time that they talk about the transporter, it sounds even more terrifying.  If a tractor beam can deflect it that significantly over only the distance to the planet, does that mean that the "beam" looks a lot like a torrent of biological matter?  Gravity can change the path of energy, sure, but not significantly over a short run, given that it tends to move much faster.

 > **PICARD**: Damn.

Did he really think that he'd magically slip through the closing door?

 > **PICARD**: Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap.

I find this line surprisingly telling.  Moments ago, he insisted that they could find "a way out of every box...a solution to every puzzle"---which I don't think actually holds true without outside help allowing him to cheat, like this situation---but now, when presented with a way out of his box, he worries that he'll escape into a trap, where...they'll imprison him, I guess?  And why would some loose window bar feel any less suspicious, then?

 > **TROI**: Surely you must have some means of communication in case of a planetary emergency.

Seriously?  It doesn't seem like a "planetary emergency" would come up nearly often enough to have a system for it, even if we posit some utility to calling your neighbors.  Do *we* have a system to communicate during planetary emergencies?

 > **CRUSHER**: Stray daydreams, scattered minutiae. I wonder how true telepaths sift through it all. How can they really get to what someone's thinking if the minds keeps churning all this flotsam to the surface? That is not funny.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I just wanted to see if you were still listening.

No, he definitely didn't.  I don't know what sexist thing crossed his mind, but we've seen plenty of evidence that he doesn't think that way for comedic effect.

 > **CRUSHER**: I mean, you're acting like you know exactly which way to go, but you're only guessing. Do you do this all the time?
 >
 > **PICARD**: No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain to give the appearance of confidence.

And by "times," he means all of them.  We've talked about this before, most prominently in [*Booby Trap*]({% post_url 2023-06-08-booby-trap %}), how this show loves the idea of "dad driving everybody home through a dangerous storm" image.

 > **CRUSHER**: Yes. I thought I was being cute, but I really hurt him. That was a long time ago. I learned a valuable lesson.

Notice that we see, once again, that the Federation largely makes women responsible for protecting men's egos.  She'll reiterate this later, when Picard realizes that she doesn't have a romantic interest in him.

 > **AIDE**: All right.

I like how Riker's reactions try to make us see these people as completely paranoid, when any mention of a Romulan causes them to completely freak out, not to mention that, in **Picard**, we'll find out that every room and hallway will soon have scanners designed to hurt shape-shifters, and Riker will happily support that...

 > **CRUSHER**: I guess I always knew that there was an attraction between us right from the start, but I never knew how strongly you felt. Why didn't you ever tell me you were in love with me?

Ick.

He, then, what, chose her to work with him---they'll quickly claim that he originally didn't want her on the *Enterprise*, but I feel like early episodes make it clear that he hand-picked his entire crew---so that he could ogle?  And he demeans her at every opportunity.  And he insists on having breakfast with her.  This feels like a shoddy attempt to write junior high school romance.

 > **CRUSHER**: And when Jack died you felt guilty.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I felt guilty before he died. Having feelings like that for my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, I promised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It would be like betraying my friend.

And now, we kind of need to revisit Jack Crusher's death.  We know from [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %}) that Picard needed to make an active choice about whether to let him die, and while they dismiss it as an accident in this conversation, Wesley mentions in [*The Bonding*]({% post_url 2023-06-01-bonding %}) that he blamed Picard for making the wrong choice, until Picard more or less bribed him for four years on the *Enterprise*.

Given that the show took such great pains to show Wesley's every crackpot theory prove out in the early days, how Picard describes Wesley in [*Evolution*]({% post_url 2023-05-04-evolution %}) as "trusting," and how he felt guilty during most of their friendship and worse after Jack died, not to mention the undercurrent of jealousy that pervades this conversation...did Picard deliberately kill Jack and use some emergency to cover it up?  After all, [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}) gave us plenty of evidence that Picard covered up his actions during his first contact with the Ferengi, aboard the same ship.

 > **RIKER**: All right then, we'll stand. The important thing is that we start talking.

You might notice how quickly Riker's "diplomacy" went from making some calls to raising his voice and angrily glaring at people.

 > **RIKER**: Then maybe you should consider this. If anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation, which means more starships will be coming to Kesprytt and those ships are going to want answers which puts your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorization? Well, just think of what it'll be like. Ten starships asking questions, contacting hundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even start sending down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find my missing officers.

As usual, local sovereignty doesn't matter, at least not when ~~mom and dad~~ sorry, *valued colleagues* go missing.

 > **PICARD**: A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does while he's asleep.

No, but he should maybe hold himself to account and apologize when it violates somebody else's boundaries.

 > **PICARD**: Now that we know how each of us feels, perhaps we should not be afraid to explore those feelings.

He said, rather emphatically, that he no longer had those feelings.  She mentioned multiple times that she didn't have more than a mild attraction.  Why does the episode feel the need to force this horrifying romance on us, when even the *characters* don't want it?  Granted, in a month and a half, she'll need to deal with an even more ill-advised romance, but *still*...

## Conclusions

We get a bit of history, here, but not too much otherwise.

### The Bad

The episode largely revolves around Picard's self-entitlement, particularly a belief that his position means that he deserves companionship---even when he doesn't feel like contributing---and romance.  He objects to people not feeding him exactly what he silently wished for and a door closing too quickly for him to run through.  He also repeatedly shows that he wants people to see him as the heroic leader, barking out ignorant orders while treating all outside help as dangerous.  And when called out about having fantasies of breaching somebody's boundaries, he denies any responsibility.

The Federation shows a decided preference for admitting unified global governments into their organization, which we might ignore if we hadn't previously seen evidence that they don't have much of an opinion over the means of unification.  They also seem to believe global-scale emergencies come up often enough that every planet would have a system to resolve them.  Likewise, diplomacy to them seems to consist of shouting and intimidation, while threatening to trash local sovereignty.  And maybe related, the Federation still has a reputation for making secret military alliances against third parties.

We also see plenty of sexism.  We might give Picard the most charitable interpretation of his unspoken lines that cause strong reactions, but we see again that the Federation makes women responsible for the emotional labor of catering to men's egos, and that (in turn) people see Crusher as cold because she has internalized that condemnation.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next week, when we have an extremely serious episode about responsibility (or, more specifically, lack thereof) in the face of environmental devastation, in *Force of Nature*.
