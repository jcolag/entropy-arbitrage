This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) starts reading **Restoration Day**, from *Trouble Brewing* to *Downhill from Here*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Restoration Day**
 * Location:  <https://deborah.makarios.nz/restoration-day/>
 * Released:  2018
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Deborah Makarios](https://deborah.makarios.nz/)
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately one hundred two thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Fear, grief

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Restoration Day

The author describes the book as follows.

 > Princess Lily was born to be queen, but she leads a pawn’s existence in the shadow of her guardians’ control. She dreams of the day when she will take her rightful place in the world.
 >
 > At last her chance arrives, with a quest for the three Requisites of Restoration Day, the royal rite which renews the life of the land. But she’s been hidden away too long, and Arcelia has changed.
 >
 > Stripped of everything but the identity which has become a life-threatening liability, Lily will need to do more than cross the board if she is to emerge triumphant as the queen she knows she must be. The land she thought was hers becomes the field for a gripping game—and this time she’s playing for her life.

Beyond that, you know what I know, at this stage.  I don't [follow Makarios on Mastodon](https://theres.life/@DMakarios), but following Free Culture-related tags means that I do see posts related to her books from time to time.

## What Works Well?

I have to admit, even if nothing else pans out well---and it actually does---the book does an excellent job of giving us reasons to keep reading.  We start with a mystery of Lily's overprotected life, and consistently throws new ideas at us, without more than occasional sentences of straight exposition.  Some early mysteries end with a mundane solution, while others add more questions than they answer.  And so far, they all feel like they come from the same story.

The major characters also feel fairly real, in that they have different knowledge and motivations, and that comes through how they interact with one another.  Not everybody gets that treatment, but we also haven't gotten far into the book.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I can only think of one serious criticism, that we have long stretches of what feel like unrelated vignettes.  The story might cash them out later as foreshadowing or preparation, and I don't exactly dislike the idea of walking us through Lily's separation long enough for her to stumble on a conversation, a clever move that feels more like a video game than a novel, but in the moment, it feels like padding for an already-lengthy novel.

## Opportunities

Other than paying for the books and leaving (kind) comments, I don't see many options.

## What's Adaptable?

We have the kingdom of Arcelia, and a selection of its recent history.  It may have a seven-day week, maybe slightly more, with day names that hint at relationships to European day-names.  The characters' lives center on the Castle of Candra, where most of this action so far takes place.

This section also introduces us to the tradition (from the title) of Restoration Day.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll continue "sampling" **Restoration Day**, reading *Recognition* and *Chemistry*.  If you get to *A Place of Safety*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
