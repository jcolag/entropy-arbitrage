As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In the turbulent Yemeni seas, the ancient Socotri language fades amid the surge of Arabic dominance, the enduring war in Yemen since 2015, and the shifting winds of power in the region.

Hashtags:  #Yemen #Language

Despite my by-now-well-documented interest in language preservation efforts, I find it absurdly comfortable to fall into the trap that the article points out, of forgetting that the Middle East and North Africa once contained a wide variety of cultures and languages that---similar to, but not quite the same as, English, Spanish, and Chinese around the world---Arabic has almost entirely displaced.

I assume that you could probably already guess this, but I find this objectionable on almost every level.  In college, I already had issues with a "meal plan" that handed money to a---in all fairness, not terrible---contracting company so that I'd have an obligation to eat their food.  Handing that same money to a faceless corporation, now, who in turn uses it to buy fast food?  That feels like a great way to have a cohort of extremely unhealthy college graduates and only enriching the wealthy.

While I tend to believe that this will have less of an impact that heavily taxing the wealthy---because their wealth gives them disproportionate advantages, not to "make them pay their fair share"---and building public services to a point where one can get by with little income, this certainly helps, and causes less of a backlash.

 > If ESI costs had remained the same proportion as in 1988, the average family with ESI could have earned $8,774 more in annual wages by 2019.

Hashtags:  #HealthCare #Money

While this had already begun, I strongly objected to the Affordable Care Act on largely these terms.  While the media tried to frame the national argument over "we shouldn't require people to have insurance" versus "but some people can't afford insurance and need it," I saw it as handing the country off to an industry whose entire business model revolves around making things cost more than they should.  And unfortunately, the modern Congress would never even consider a bill creating a publicly owned health insurance entity to compete, so the best move involved trying to *simulate* a "public option" through regulation.

I say all this to make the point that any solution to health care that involves privatized insurance will inevitably take as much money out of the economy as it can, because the vast majority of people can't afford to go without.

I find this history fascinating in that we (I imagine) presumably all *know* it already, but we don't realize that we know it.  For example, the end of the article points out Santer√≠a and If√° as surviving practices, which if you don't know a practitioner of either personally, you've certainly seen them represented in fiction.  But we don't associate the origins of those traditions with their history...until reading something like this.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/abortion-roe-v-wade-adults-having-children-childfree-1600.jpg|An anti-abortion activist holds up a sign that read "We Dissent" in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on June 25, 2022, in Washington, DC|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Since Roe was overturned, fewer Michigan adults want kids](https://www.futurity.org/roe-overturned-having-children-3166832-2/) from Futurity

 > In late 2022, following the passage of Proposal 3, which protects the right to reproductive freedom, the Michigan Constitution was amended to protect access to abortion. However, Watling Neal explains, ‚ÄúThat protection came only after a lot of [uncertainty](https://www.futurity.org/ivf-after-dobbs-2806492-2/) and legal chaos, which may have led potential parents to decide having children simply isn‚Äôt worth the health risks.‚Äù

This fits with the broader trend of people---for decades---wondering if they should risk having children in a world and society that don't seem at all healthy.  If some official might *also* want to throw you in jail for a miscarriage or needing to terminate an unviable pregnancy, that feels like it makes the decision far easier, as long as you haven't prioritized child-rearing.

By the way, I question validity of the caption on the image.  In late June 2022, what "anti-abortion activist" would have dissented from [Alito's anti-abortion screed disguised as a Supreme Court opinion]({% post_url 2022-05-08-alito %})?  They got exactly what they wanted.

{% cw US Politics, Trump %}

 > "If you take immunity away from the president‚Äîso important‚Äîyou will have a president that's not going to be able to do anything," Trump stressed. "Because when he leaves office, the opposing party‚Äîpresident, if it's the opposing party‚Äîwill indict the president for doing something that should have been good."

Those "good" things, by the way, which Trump wants immunity for, include...

 * Defaming E. Jean Carroll.
 * Stealing secret documents and spreading the country's nuclear secrets.
 * Taking bribes from foreign countries.
 * Extorting foreign countries.
 * Inciting an insurrection, because he didn't like the outcome of an election.

I found Trump tiring *before* DC Comics based their then-new version of Lex Luthor on him, and can't believe that I still need to deal with him in the media...
