As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Constructed in 1883, for Sultan Barghash bin Said, the spectacular building with seafront views of the Indian Ocean, was the first to have electricity and a working elevator in Zanzibar.

Obviously, colonization isn't good no matter who's behind it, but it's still disappointing to see such a historically relevant site fall apart.

 > More than 1,000 of the plant’s 2,800 workers contracted the virus. Six of them died.

I have to admit that it does take a certain *something* to behave in a way that sickens half a group, joke about it, try to profit off the pain, and then try to spin it as an attempt to be helpful.

 > Humanity has a strange fondness for following processions. Get four men following a banner down the street, and, if that banner is inscribed with rhymes of pleasant optimism, in an hour, all the town will be afoot, ready to march to whatever tune the leaders care to play.

 > The lack of resources and added stress increase the chance that a child may develop gaps in social, emotional, and language skills by the time they begin school...

I'm not excited about the "poor people would be less criminal if they learned to tolerate more trauma" angle of the study, that doesn't invalid the use of kids understanding emotions.

 > At one point the president asked Germany to substantiate baseless rumors that ballots which cast votes for Trump in Fulton County were "shredded"...

The real story is---and I'm hardly the first person to say so---that the Republican Party has been watching behavior far more criminal than anything from the Nixon administration, and rather than call for Trump's resignation or work with Democrats to remove him from office, they support him, because they're directly opposed to democracy.

 > Gaia’s years-long data set described the detailed motions of roughly 1 billion stars.

Astronomy doesn't do as much to directly improve the world as one might hope, but it provides some of the best illustrations of the scientific process at work, given that every generation provides exponentially more data to look at.

I couldn't really find a bonus article for the week, unfortunately.  Sorry, if that's what you're here for.  There was *plenty* of news, this week, though...
