As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > It links to the social model of disability. This, put simply, is the idea that disabled people are disabled by barriers in society, rather than by our impairments.

If nothing else, this makes a decent counter-argument to the perpetual plans for handling accessibility, which generally amounts to letting companies do whatever they want, and "allowing" disabled patrons to *request* eventual equal treatment.  This exposes the detail that those obstacles didn't arise spontaneously.

Butler mined her boundless curiosity to forge a new vision for humanity](https://theconversation.com/how-octavia-e-butler-mined-her-boundless-curiosity-to-forge-a-new-vision-for-humanity-185342) from The Conversation

 > Her interest in subjects such as slime-molds, cancer and biotechnology come through in her stories in ways that readers might not expect.

I haven't read nearly enough of Butler's work, and need to remedy that soon.

 > Their understanding of the world is so limited that, first, they do not stop to think that the world does not revolve around them.

This story has a lot going on, though I assume that everyone will recognize the core sexism and other bigotry.

 > ...the settlement is notable because it is the first time a company has been sanctioned for algorithmic bias under the Fair Housing Act.

Like the article says, the fine won't impact Facebook/Meta, but this marks a huge change in policy that we should all look forward to seeing expand.

 > In the U.S. market, only three companies produce over 80 percent of all baby food products. Four companies produce over 85 percent of all canned tuna.

I've posted articles about market concentration before, and they all end in the same ways.  Either prices skyrocket or the company's minor issues become the population's crises.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Women in science get less credit on papers and patents](https://www.futurity.org/women-in-science-credit-authorship-2758242-2/) from Futurity

 > ...women who worked on a research project were 13% less likely to be named as authors in related scientific articles compared to their male colleagues.

I believe that we already knew this from other sources, but it always bears confirmation if we ever plan to do anything about it on a larger scale than *occasional* researchers highlighting the work of women.
