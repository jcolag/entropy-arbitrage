As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...it’s the local officials, like mayors, state representatives, and even school board members, who make the greatest impact on daily life in your community.

This is good information to have on hand.  As I've [been saying]({% post_url 2020-08-30-parties %}) for a while, now, the difference between a political movement and a mere political *campaign* is what happens when there isn't an election coming.  White nationalists have shown a willingness to pressure elected officials at all levels.  Because white nationalists are wrong about...well, *everything*, the rest of us need to step up, too.

Always remember that noted racist Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law and right-wing criminal Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, actions that seem absurdly progressive in 2021.  They didn't do these things because they were secretly nice people.  They did them because they were terrified of the pressure they'd feel---from pressuring smaller offices to mass demonstrations to general strikes---if they failed.

I'm always happy to see projects that work to surface a more diverse group of role models for people.

 > ...at least several of the same accounts spreading the disinformation have in recent weeks urged their followers to attend the pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6...

There is a direct and unconcealed line from the [Lost Cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy) narrative to the [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) to the [Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement) movement to the whiny and violent backlash against [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) to everything done to keep Donald Trump in office.  So, of course the same accounts are spreading misinformation about both.  And, of course, my opinions on [social media]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %})'s cozy relationship with white nationalists are probably well-known to anybody reading here.

 > ...these bills were teed up long ago to criminalize peaceful protest, stifle speech, and obscure the clear distinction between First Amendment rights and a violent insurrection.

The article doesn't make it *nearly* clear enough that these are reactionary (Republican) politicians trying to exploit the legitimate fear of further reactionary violence in order to silence peaceful liberal/progressive protests, because they're terrified of being asked to consider the possibility that Black lives matter, women aren't wombs with feet, and immigrants aren't marauding villains.

As I mentioned above, we've been here before.  If we can't be bothered to learn what happened those times, it's easy to see that things aren't going to go well at all.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth and seventh article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Cops Arrest Essential Union Workers Striking for $1 Raise](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vgvj/cops-arrest-essential-union-workers-striking-for-dollar1-raise) from VICE Motherboard

 > It is outrageous that after being called essential heroes for months, several of our members were arrested while peacefully protesting for a raise today.

Over the spring, I [mentioned]({% post_url 2020-05-31-police %}) that a big part of early police duties included violently suppressing labor actions.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Hong Kong protesters’ ‘Brick Arches’ wins Beazley Designs’ People’s Choice Award](https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/23/hong-kong-protesters-brick-arches-wins-beazley-designs-peoples-choice-award/) from Global Voices

 > The “Brick Arches” emerged in Hong Kong's major protest sites around November 2019 spontaneously as protesters made use of handy materials on streets to block police vehicles from entering protest sites.

OK, I'm impressed.
