## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Aquiel

For full-franchise context, this episode aired after *Captive Pursuit*, featuring an alien bred as prey for hunters.

 > **RIKER**: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have been tampered with, and we are close to Klingon space.

 > **PICARD**: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation for more than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until we have more evidence.

I have to appreciate that they jumped to blaming random aliens.

 > **UHNARI**: Hello, Shiana. By the time you get this the Batarael will be over. This is the first time I haven't been there. I've been wondering, who's singing the Horath in my place. {% emoji musical notes %} Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia. Rumael tavariel fatra di va Jomiael {% emoji musical notes %} ... I had that dream again. The one where Mother is screaming. I climb the hill to our house, but I can't get to her. Shiana, this time I ran away. I was so scared I ran back down the hill. I think I know why I've been having the dreams about danger. It's because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat.

You might recognize Uhnari as [RenÃ©e Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Jones), who started her almost two-decade (and second) run on [**Days of Our Lives**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives) at around that time, winning an NAACP Image Award for it.

 > **PICARD**: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiter of Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here and investigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer.

He really asked to see a manager.  Amazing.

Really, though, he keeps milking that relatively small favor that he did for Gowron---in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-02-redemption %}), by the way, so almost two years ago---as if he owns the empire.

 > **UHNARI**: Shiana, you always said I'd look great with a wig, so here it is. What do you think?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Definitely not you.

What, the creepy incel engineer takes time out to judge a woman's appearance?  Who would've guessed...?  He'll do it to her face when they meet, too, in case you thought that he accidentally voiced his opinion.

 > **LAFORGE**: How could she read this stuff?

Oh, he decided to judge her choice of entertainment, too.  Or maybe he has a serious question, here, and doesn't actually understand literacy, given his prior odd relationship with reading, such as his inability to alphabetize five words in [*The Mind's Eye*]({% post_url 2024-04-18-mind-s-eye %})...

 > **TORAK**: You still try to blame us.

In fairness, they also tried to blame Uhnari without much evidence...

 > **UHNARI**: Yes, it's from **Cold Moon over Blackwater**. Have you read it?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I'm not much for Gothic fiction.

The title seems to originate in this episode.  Assuming that [Gothic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction) has the same meaning for them as it has for us, as suggested by the title, then the genre and presumed focus on heroine Maura gives us some vague idea of what people find popular when they don't obsess over 1930s Americana.

Also, this puts La Forge's criticism of the book a couple of scenes ago into new light.  He doesn't even know the genre to have a valid criticism of the people who enjoy that particular title, much like our culture often reflexively dismisses genres like romance and horror, which tend to appeal more to women, and people often feel the need to call it something else when men finally learn about a well-made work in those genres.

 > **LAFORGE**: We travelled around quite a bit when I was growing up. I picked up a couple of languages along the way.

How has this not come up in six years?  It seems like that would've proved more useful, at some point, than his go-to assignment of "go look out a window."

 > **UHNARI**: Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the minute he reported to duty. He treated me as though I was beneath contempt. I felt like I had to battle him to hold my own. But I didn't want to see him dead.

We've never seen this extremity in action, but this definitely echoes the sort of treatment of representatives of minority groups that we've regularly heard from people like Worf and Data.

 > **RIKER**: We found this type-two phaser in your shuttle-craft. It was taken from the weapons locker on the station.

The aggression here feels like it echoes [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-21-time-s-arrow-2 %}), when Riker went so far out of his way to talk about how he feels connected to an organization---the early San Francisco Police Department---described as "quite as much to be feared as the robbers" by Albert Bernard de Russailh and burned down a homeless encampment shortly after the episode.

It also echoes Moriarty's comment, last week in [*Ship in a Bottle*]({% post_url 2025-02-06-ship-in-bottle %}), that he'd recognize police officers "in any century."

 > **RIKER**: I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgment.

C'mon, don't make me do a spit-take while I write these.  Only a few weeks ago (their time, less in ours), Riker whined about needing to prioritize rescuing his surrogate father over all other concerns in [*The Quality of Life*]({% post_url 2025-01-16-quality-life %}) and [*The Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-30-chain-command-2 %}) in recent weeks, and has had similar conflicts in previous episodes.  He always lets his personal feelings cloud his judgment...but since the beginning, he has also had his weird double-standard with La Forge.

 > **MORAG**: I killed no one!

You might recognize Morag as [Reg E. Cathey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_E._Cathey), who has made plenty of appearances over the years in both mainstream and children's media.

 > **LAFORGE**: Aquiel, running away isn't going to prove your innocence. Facing the situation will.

Yeah, a Black man with a disability who everybody dumps on, telling a Black-presenting woman who has told us about the discrimination against her, and recently underwent a traumatic interrogation that didn't really care what she had to say, that she should trust the legal system, during a murder investigation that has *only* turned up dark-skinned, non-human suspects.  That seems reasonable...

 > **COMPUTER**: Commander Morag is in his quarters. Lieutenant Uhnari is not aboard the Enterprise.

Seriously, these people need to learn about system alerts...

## Conclusions

Well, we don't get much out of this episode, but a bit more than I expected, including a "Gothic novel."

### The Bad

We see that everybody sees crime as something that non-humans do.  And our first evidence of contemporary police work shows aggressive, intimidating interrogations with no defense attorney present.  But they also consider it all fair.

Picard continues to hold his favor to Gowron over the head of every Klingon he meets.  Likewise, Riker feels the need to hypocritically lecture people on controlling their emotions.  Possibly closely related, the episode reiterates that people from minority backgrounds face ostracization and other social obstacles in the Federation.

La Forge shows an extreme disdain of literature favored by women despite having no experience with it, and finds it appropriate to criticize their appearances.

And they still haven't figured out that, if you need to keep track of somebody, then you have the computer warn somebody when they leave the area.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when somebody new tries to figure out if Troi has any use, in *Face of the Enemy*.
