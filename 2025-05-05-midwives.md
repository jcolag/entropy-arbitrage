Today marks the [International Day of the Midwife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_the_Midwife), celebrating and raising awareness of the profession.  Here in the United States, we've begun the process of replacing reproductive care with illegally trafficked whale-heads, worm medication, and probably Folgers Crystals, to see if anybody notices the difference.

Or if you want something more celebratory, then the United States has so fully appropriated [Cinco de Mayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo)---without having the foggiest idea about any relevance of the [Battle of Puebla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Puebla), I might add---that I can *probably* get away with offering *Mayo de Cinco B---*OK, maybe not.

Anyway, let's check out the week's projects.

## Stenotype Corner

Sit tight while I explain this new, recurring section...

A while back---OK, actually three and a half years ago, somehow---I started thinking about learning machine stenography, writing a [post describing stenotype]({% post_url 2021-11-28-steno %}), asserting that I'd practice every day and soon start using my SOFT-HRUF keyboard regularly.  And then...I mostly didn't.

Or, rather, I do this a couple of times every year, then mostly abandon it.  Every time, I haul out the keyboard, set it up, open [**Art of Chording**](https://www.artofchording.com/), and start reading.  While I read, I keep a text editor open and transcribe example lines.  Soon, the weather changes, or I otherwise need to move more, and outside my usual workspace, the exercise fades from memory.  It feels like some muscle memory remains, each time, so that the process gets a bit further along each time, but it never feels like progress.

During the week, the thought crossed my mind that more formal drilling might help.  When I took a typing class (in high school), nobody *enjoyed* the early drills---typing line after line such as "lad sad fad fall" and so forth---it deliberately built that muscle memory.  I considered developing drills starting with each single-syllable word quickly identifiable on the stenotype keyboard (the sixty-something combinations of s/t/p/h/k/w/r, a/o/e/u, and f/p/l/t/r/b/g/s), and repeat random selections of them.  For example, from a Linux command line, something like this.

```sh
grep '^[stphkwr][aoeu][fpltrbgs]$' /usr/share/dict/words | sort -R | head -15 | paste -sd ' '
```

That ignores that the standard dictionary has a bunch of entries that probably won't appear in [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/)'s dictionary---hep, and so forth---but then I'd need to think about timing the drills, monitoring errors, and so forth.  That seemed like time that I didn't necessarily want to spend right now, so I searched for an alternative, finding [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/).  I've seen the name before, but never investigated it, probably assuming proprietary software or not realizing what it did.  However, silly name aside---as if I have a leg to stand on with a criticism like that...---it provides a Free Software platform, which I could self-host if I want, that provides exactly these sorts of drills.  It starts a bit more advanced than I would've gone, but close enough.

Anyway, it also occurred to me that, when I started this blog, I did so with at least partly an interest in holding myself accountable.  And that brings us, finally, to this section.  Since learning machine stenography does qualify as a "project," if I go through these drills a couple of times per day, then I should provide my results, so that (a) we can all see how long it'll take me to learn this, and (b) the presumed embarrassment of writing "no practice, no progress," week after week *might* actually convince me to keep with this, even when I might prefer to do something else.

As such, I'll work out the format as we go, but for now, after my first few days at this, I can say that I've made it through the first lesson a few times, reaching a maximum of (a pretty sorry) nineteen words per minute with an almost passable 89.62% accuracy.

In my (extremely weak) defense, Typey Type cuts against how I expect typing lessons to work.  In the aforementioned school class, we learned that you *never* correct yourself in drills, because you need to look away from the thing that you need to read, and switching contexts leads to further problems.  Related, if you need to transcribe speech, then stopping to fix an error means losing additional words.  And I get hit by exactly that (former) problem, trying to hit an "undo last word" key (the starred keys on diagrams), then get the correct word, without the two colliding that causes more wrong words, requiring undoing more.  Looking at the detailed results, I can see the mistakes clustered tightly, often around nine over a couple of words.

Also, though, as a start, I can live with that.

All that to say that, at least for the duration, Stenotype Corner will become a regular feature in the developer diary posts, to make sure that I keep at working at it regularly and (in an ideal world) improving.  It might only include the current lesson, speed, and accuracy, rather than the seven hundred words this week...

## Mystic T-Square

{% github jcolag/mystic-t-square %}

Work continues apace on updating the game's code to support the AI---again, I mean code that calculates appropriate moves, rather than some absurdly expensive Markov process---while also updating the modal pop-ups (for the About, Options, and Statistics interfaces) to use the more modern `dialog` HTML elements.

You'll also see the start of fixing and managing the AI code.  Probably of the most interest and the most impactful in this batch of changes, the AI now stores and uses all partial results, so that the forecasting never duplicates any work.  It looks something like this, in the `testSlides()` function.

```JavaScript
const sig = signature(map);
if (slidesForState[sig]) {
  return slidesForState[sig];
}

// ...

slidesForState[sig] = result;
```

The `signature()` function creates a unique but reproducible text string for every possible board state, so that the code definitely stores and retrieves what it has available for that state.

Some other small changes that will become useful have also fit into place, such as checking if a player exists before continuing the game.  Soon enough, with the option to have the AI handle the tile-sliding, that will help us turn the AI on and off.

## Next

I probably said this last week, but I need to finish getting the **Mystic T-Square**'s AI running, and then it'll need configuration options to turn the AI on and off (making it a one- or two-player game) and eventually tuning the AI to favor different outcomes.  I also worked out how to refactor the blog's SASS code.
