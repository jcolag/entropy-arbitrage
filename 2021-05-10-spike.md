In certain parts of the United States, people celebrate today as the anniversary of the completion of the [Overland Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Route_(Union_Pacific_Railroad))---the first intercontinental railroad, depending on your definition---symbolized by the ceremonial [golden spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spike) used as the final connection.

Let's get to the projects.

## All Around the News

If you're following [**All Around the News**](https://allaroundthe.news/), though I haven't released the source code, I improved the article summaries and added a navigation-bar item to show when there are new articles available to read.

## Doritís Onomáton

I only made a small cosmetic change to [**Doritís Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/doritis-onomaton).  The saved names show with lock icons.

## Fýlakas Onomáton

[**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton/) didn't get as far as I would have liked, but it's close to a bare-minimum server for users to manage lists of names.

## Library Updates

I started chopping at the list of Dependabot warnings to update projects, starting with [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), since I'm under the impression that people use it.

## Next

**Fýlakas Onomáton** needs the remainder of the user-security code put into place, and then I'll need to work out the API and connect **Doritís Onomáton** to it.
