As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > For some reason, a week after Trump submitted to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16 and 15 days before Paul would carry a letter from Trump to Putin expressing an interest in remaining besties, Paul was in a meeting discussing the FBI officials Trump had a vendetta against (who also happen to be Russian experts).

Paul, notably, [claims](https://twitter.com/LoveAmelia5/status/1658168387837612032) that he met about revoking John Brennan‚Äôs security clearance.  But, even ignoring everything else about this, when have *you* ever attended a meeting with only one topic on the agenda?

 > The man who receives five thousand dollars a year wants six thousand dollars a year, and the man who owns eight or nine hundred thousand dollars will want a hundred thousand dollars more to make it a million, while the man who has his millions will want everything he can lay his hands on and then raise his voice against the poor devil who wants ten cents more a day.

 > Court rulings have effectively hobbled multiple pro-democracy parties in the past. And Thailand‚Äôs army over the years has resorted to coups when it feels that it has been sidelined from the center of power.

Hashtags:  #Thailand #Democracy

Thailand has more than a little authority in the area.  This could grow a lot bigger, even as countries like [Cambodia crack down on opposition parties](https://globalvoices.org/2023/05/21/cambodias-main-opposition-party-disqualified-from-july-election/).

 > Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.

This actually under-plays the situation by a wide margin.  In a lot of places, the bigoted white population [staged violent insurrections](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/black-red-white-all-over) to run the elected Black officials out of office.

 > Willis wrote that the arguments put forth in the motions fail to meet the ‚Äúexacting standards" for disqualifying a prosecutor and they also fail to prove their claims that their own due process rights have been violated or that the grand jury process was ‚Äútainted‚Äù or the law governing it unconstitutional.

Hashtags:  #USPol #FaniWillis #Trump

This seems like a good sign, not only that Willis pushes back against the petty attempts to impact her case against Trump, but also because the new law about removing prosecutors---a law almost certainly written to disrupt the case against Trump---doesn't seem to have an impact.

 > One organization peddling flat-out lies in order to pave the way for ending access to contraception is Pulse Life Advocates. The group‚Äôs website makes claims that are so preposterous, they veer on comical ‚Äî such as ‚Äúcontraception increases likelihood of divorce‚Äù and ‚Äúcontraception kills babies.‚Äù

Hashtags:  #Abortion #BirthControl

I write in support of abortion, periodically, but I don't talk much about birth control pills, even though Sam Alito almost certainly salivates at the prospect of banning them, too.  And I have to admit that represents a flaw on the blog, because I find it a fascinating story that the [placebo pills exist in hopes of appeasing the Catholic Church](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sugar-pills-in-your-birth-control-pack-are-only-there-to-placate-the-pope), rather than for medical reasons, and that the [myth of the biological clock](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/10/foul-reign-of-the-biological-clock) exists largely as a way to control women in response to birth control.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://cdn2.opendemocracy.net/media/images/Berkovich.max-760x504.jpg|Russian theater director Yevgenia Berkovich, detained on charges of justification of terrorism, sits inside a defendants' cage during her remand hearing at a Moscow court on 5 May 2023|false| %}

 > The play has been acclaimed for making one of the most influential feminist statements in Russian theater. In 2022, it even won two Golden Mask awards --- the country‚Äôs top theater prize --- for best playwright and best costume design.

Imagine how shaky your government's position would have to feel, that it would feel the need to prosecute theaters for its productions not being nice enough to it.

 > It also impacted individual or corporate users who incurred heavy losses due to the disruption in internet services. As Pakistanis eagerly awaited the restoration of internet services, unconfirmed reports circulated on social media, providing conflicting information about the resumption.

Well, this probably won't go well...

 > ...female baboons who have the hardest childhoods have life spans that are on average only half as long as their peers that have the easiest. Activities like smoking and unhealthy food choices can‚Äôt be the whole story, then, since animals don‚Äôt engage in typical human health risk behaviors.

This probably doesn't rate as the most important story of the week, but enough people had rough childhoods that this research might have some direct utility.
