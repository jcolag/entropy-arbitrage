## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Interface

Prepare yourself for the franchise's biggest waste of a guest star.  Or rather, two guest stars.

Since last week, by the way, the crew on **DS9** needed to stop a coup against the Bajoran government in *The Circle*.

 > **RIKER**: Geordi, have you found it yet?

We really kick off the episode asking the Black guy to look out a window?  I'll grant you that they found a *fancy* window, this time, but this still feels like a regression by a few years.  He runs an entire critical department, but because he has a disability---and I can't help but suspect that melanin plays a role in this, too---they give him these menial jobs that turn him into an ambulatory scanner.

I get that they need to establish the gimmick that the rest of the episode relies on, but this seems like the most regressive way of doing that...

 > **CRUSHER**: The interface is perfect for Geordi because his visor inputs allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral cortex.

Thank goodness that his disability can have a commercial application... {% emoji eyeroll %}

 > **LAFORGE**: Nothing. I'm seeing my reflection in a panel.  I forgot what a handsome guy I am.

Personally, I find it highly disturbing that they apparently programmed this probe-thing, designed to sense dangerous places in detail, to replace its own appearance with the pilot's.  If it does that, how can they trust anything else that it shows?

Also, couldn't they plug this into a TV?

 > **HOLT**: We're hosting this year's palio. The Ferengi have already been accused of trying to bribe the Breen pilot into throwing the race.
 >
 > **PICARD**: There's nothing unusual about that.

The [palio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palio), starting in medieval Italy, pits neighboring communities against each other in athletic contests.

Mostly, though, I quote the lines due to the off-handed mention of accusations against the Ferengi, because why treat them like people, right...?

Also, you might recognize the admiral as [Warren Munson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Munson), who fans of the franchise will recognize as slightly different admiral ~~Nick Locarno's~~ Tom Paris's father on **Voyager**.

 > **SILVA**: I saw your father last week and your sister about ten days before that. I decided I missed my favorite son.

You might recognize Captain La Forge as [Madge Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madge_Sinclair), who we actually last saw in [**The Voyage Home**]({% post_url 2022-04-07-tvh %}) as the *Saratoga*'s captain, but also featured prominently in [**Roots**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_%281977_miniseries%29) (also featuring LeVar Burton), [**Coming to America**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_to_America), and a quite a bit more until her untimely death a couple of years after this episode.

 > **LAFORGE**: My mother's always trying to find me a wife.

Given how he creeped on a bunch of other women that we've seen, I don't understand his objection, unless he has a problem with consent...

 > **LAFORGE**: The *Hera* is missing, that's all. Now until I hear something different, my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an unscheduled holiday. Let's go.

I *almost* made a comment about how this might make one of the few exceptions that we've seen to the broader theme of estranged relationships, but the dismissals of his mother's interests and now this complete lack of concern flips that around.

 > **LAFORGE**: If we turn down the sensory input on the probe, I should be fine. Seven people lost their lives down there, Captain. We should at least retrieve the information they were collecting.

I would've gone with "at least mourn them and collect their remains for their families," but sure, harvest the data...

 > **EDWARD**: I spoke with your sister this morning. She said she'll be in touch with you in a few days. Right now, she's pretty upset. The service for the *Hera* will probably be on Vulcan. Most of the crew was from there. But your sister and I want to have a private ceremony.

This gives us some idea of how actual mourning works, at least on Earth.  And it emphasizes the strained family relations, given that you'd think that La Forge would have mentioned a sister long before now, especially with the introduction of his "work-sister" in [*Identity Crisis*]({% post_url 2024-03-07-identity-crisis %}).

By the way, you might recognize Dr. La Forge as [Ben Vereen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Vereen), who...look, honestly, I could give you a long list of places where you might have seen him, but I've enjoyed so much of his work that I worry that such a list might overwhelm the post.  Instead, I'll mention that, when accused of sexual harassment about seven years ago, he apologized, emphasizing the harm that his conduct did and the irrelevance of his intentions, meaning that I don't need to try to dance around my appreciation.

That said, not that I object to spending money on him, but why even hire Ben Vereen, if you only have this nothing role for him...?

 > **LAFORGE**: Thanks. You know, Data, maybe you gave up a little too easily.

Creep.  He chastised his (alleged) friend for looking after him, then when said friend backs off and offers his time instead, he complains about not getting comforted.  I'd say that he should see a therapist, but we've all seen how *that* pans out on this show...

 > **PICARD**: Is there any indication what caused this hallucination?

Ever the supportive leader, Picard assumes that he must've imagined the whole thing.  Even Crusher won't bother to defend him, despite how many times that the captain has done that to her.

 > **TROI**: You're worried about the disappearance of your mother, guilty that you didn't see her when you had the chance, so you're unwilling to consider that she might be dead. Your need to believe she's alive is so strong that it manifests itself as a physical image.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **TROI**: No. Because that would be the end of your fantasy. You'd know it wasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your story is, the longer you can believe your mother's still alive.

Oh, right.  The therapy thing goes like this, with Troi doing nothing but repeating Picard's accusation that he imagined the whole thing.

 > **PICARD**: Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support this hypothesis?

He *presented* his evidence, and they dismissed most of it as his illogical fantasy.

 > **RIKER**: My mother died when I was a baby. All I have is pictures, and the stories that my father used to tell me about her. I begged him to tell those stories over and over. When I was five, and I went to school, I started to tell my new friends those same stories, pretending that she was alive. Then I started believing that she was alive, that she'd just gone away, that she was coming back. The teacher got wind of this, and she and my father had this talk with me. They told me it was important to accept the fact that my mother was dead and that she wasn't coming back. And all the hoping in the world wouldn't make it so. In my mind, that was the day that my mother actually died. I cried all that night. But after that, it started feeling better.

Thank goodness that he managed to make this episode about him...

Also, I'd like to point out that *both* his bosses, plus one minion, came to him with big shows of empathy so that they could dismiss his experience.

 > **DATA**: I will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe. I can not have you confined to quarters for something you have not yet done.

This scene took a *long* time to get around to "maybe constant authoritarianism doesn't work," though they only replaced it with personal loyalties.

 > **DATA**: We are at ninety percent of tolerance. My calculations show you will reach one hundred percent of tolerance before you are in range of the Hera.

Can they not...automate this?

 > **PICARD**: Are these beings...responsible for the death of the *Raman*'s crew?

I can only think of one reason that Picard would ask that question in this situation, honestly:  He wanted revenge on somebody for the deaths.  At this stage, you can only really care about this information if it'll figure into the decision on whether to proceed with the rescue.

 > **PICARD**: I will deal with Mister Data at another time. Meanwhile, I will have to write this incident into your permanent record.

Oh, no, now he won't get into a good college...

## Conclusions

The episode focuses mostly on personal issues, but we can squeeze a surprising amount out of it.

### The Bad

The episode, despite some misdirection, focuses primarily on how the crew dismisses the value of their Black colleague who has a disability.  They use the top-flight engineer as a fancy drone pilot, praise his disability for his prosthetic's convenience to them, dismiss his experiences as hallucinations, and then go out of their way to call that supportive.  Therapy, likewise, has gone back to combinations of clichÃ©s and dismissive conversations.

We also get a reminder that everybody presumes that the Ferengi plan to cheat at whatever they participate in.

People continue to suppress grief.  That happens on the personal level, of outright ignoring the disappearance of family until it overwhelms them.  And it happens institutionally, where they want to recover derelict ships...but primarily to recover their work.  However, at least some families have private mourning rituals, with Starfleet seemingly holding funerary services for dead crews based on the dominant planet of origin of the crew's members.

They apparently spend a lot of time balancing strict hierarchies with personal loyalties.

The episode also seems to end with the idea that Picard might consider letting the novel intelligent creatures die, on the basis that he worries that they might have caused the deaths of his colleagues.

### The Weird

We continue to see that everybody seems to have estranged family relationships.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next week, when the crew looks for underprivileged people to beat up to avenge Picard's rumored death, in *Gambit*, part 1.
