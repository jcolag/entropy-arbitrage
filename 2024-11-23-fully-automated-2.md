This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading **Fully Automated!**.

![The book's cover, featuring a cat-lady with sunglasses vaulting backwards over two armed people on small flying machines over a disrupted market](/blog/assets/fully-automated-cover.png "I feel like the cover promises us body-modification furries that the text doesn't bother to pay off")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Fully Automated!**
 * Location:  <https://fullyautomatedrpg.com/>
 * Released:  2023 (?)
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Andrew R. Gross and others
 * Medium:  Role-playing game
 * Length:  Approximately two hundred sixty pages
 * Content Advisories:  Some ill-advised politics, maybe

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Fully Automated

The website's [answers page](https://fullyautomatedrpg.com/get-answers/) describes the game as follows.

 > Fully Automated is a tabletop role-playing game designed to provide a certain set of tools and stories that the creators of this game couldn’t previously find elsewhere.
 >
 > The game is meant to allow players to go on street-level adventures in a solarpunk future. If you’re not familiar, solarpunk is a genre adjacent to cyberpunk, but which largely challenges and inverts most of its dominant themes. It envisions a world in which technology and our societies are brought into harmony with nature. It rejects cynicism about the futility of fighting to challenge power structures. In place of themes of scarcity and selfishness, it imagines abundance shared convivially. And in place of a nihilistic view that life is valueless, it imagines not just that every person is priceless, but that personhood can be granted to far more things than just humans. But while it is growing fast, tools for running solarpunk tabletop games are still too few.

It goes on to explain that, unlike many genres, solarpunk needs more source material to make people comfortable devising new situations, hence the long page-counts across multiple books.

Speaking of "multiple books," note that we *won't* touch the supplemental two hundred pages of adventures and campaign information.  But by the same token, if you want more about this world, the team has more available.

## What Works Well?

While the "sapience scale" admittedly gives me creepy [IQ test obsession](https://wellcomecollection.org/stories/exceptional-talent-and-the-trouble-with-iq-tests) vibes, the modeling of uplifted/enhanced animals *in the context* of that sapience, as immigrant populations feels like a brilliant move.  Similarly, while I wish that it had gone further into depth and maybe combined it with the people trying to live out fictional lives---because they require affordances similar in concept, not because they come from the same need---the fact that the world's description has a section on ways to handle disability puts it far ahead of a lot of work in this space.

I also love this criticism of a lot of modern media.

 > The lesson from this is that stealth operations should largely eschew some of the common staples that we see in fiction such as person-sized ducts that allow characters to move through conveniently unmonitored areas and laser sensors that must be evaded with gymnastics. If you want to include either of these, you certainly can.

It does, after all, feel absurd that we live in a world of cheap and widespread surveillance, to say nothing of what we might have in a century or two, but our fictional counterparts still sneak around in ways that only *barely* worked in the 1980s.  It has other ideas like this, too, trying to ground the characters in the reality of the fictional world, rather than turning their lives into a series of tropes.

You'll also find a surprisingly rich set of references, both inspirations or games with complementary ideas---including a couple of games under Free Culture licenses, by the way, and so could one day find themselves in these pages---and tools that might help with the overall presentation of the world.  And the "Principles and Moves" section near the end feels like it deserved far more attention, maybe even driving the rest of the structure.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I had suspicions when writing the first post for the book, but didn't want to prematurely suggest it, given the nature of the text.  Having finished, though, it seems troubling that we have more modular pieces than a cohesive world.  We have governments, informal governments in communities, policing organizations, militaries, other service organizations, banks, other pseudo-companies, and more, and maybe I missed it, but I don't see the unified vision of how it all fits together.  Or, rather, it feels like the book expects the players to provide the unified vision.  Even many of the suggested adventures feel like you could drop them into any setting, with some investigation and maybe some fighting, and nothing would change except the details.

This section also gives the strong impression that it might not understand its premise, or wants us to not trust the setting.  For example, after assuring us that people don't need to work and so forth, it then talks about building affordable housing.  Or it'll talk about how communities should no longer threaten people with prison time, then turns around and suggests "exile to an ungoverned penal island" as an alternative.  It introduces social class conflict, but then tries to "balance" the classes to assure us that nobody looks down on anybody else, and *then* insists that classes don't have much visibility.  Similarly, it seems to want to endorse a parallel to the [sovereign citizen movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) as impressively self-reliant, before too-briefly suggesting them as antagonists in a world of cooperation...alongside pagans.

## What's Adaptable?

As mentioned, this section gives us plenty of timelines and lists of almost every kind of organization, which somebody could probably lift into some other setting.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read **Ancient Fire**, poems (and translations).

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book?
