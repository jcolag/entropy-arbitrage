In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Outcast

This episode has achieved a certain level of infamy, so I suspect that it makes more sense for me to keep quiet up here and argue against the concepts as we go.

 > Captain's log, stardate 45614.6. We have been contacted by an androgynous race called the J'naii to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of their shuttle-craft.

Did Picard's log turn up its nose at the idea of androgynous people?  Or did he emphasize the word to make sure that we'd understand the plot?

 > Captain's log, supplemental. The sudden disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of what is called null space, an anomaly which until now had been only theoretical. Commander Riker has been working around the clock with a team of J'naii specialists to formalize this hypothesis.

Right?  Because when you think of formal academics and esoteric astrophysics, you automatically think of sending *Riker*, and not literally anybody else...

 > **RIKER**: OK. For two days I've been trying to construct sentences without personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? It? To us, that's rude.
 >
 > **SOREN**: We use a pronoun which is neutral. I do not think there is really a translation.

OK, stand back, because thirty-plus years later, we have the Internet, which lets me tell you *exactly* how horribly wrong they got this barely relevant line.

Early in the life of the blog, you see, I wrote a [post about labeling yourself without backing that up with action]({% post_url 2020-03-08-are-do %})[^1] where, to make a point that critics need to shut up about their problems with the [singular *they*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they), I did some research on personal pronouns beyond the gender binary and their age.  I came up with the following list.

[^1]:  And, on the way there, said some things that I quickly came to regret---such as denying the value in someone with my societal privilege stating my preferred personal pronouns---and since have amended in later posts and my actions.

 * they/them/their, in the guise of Middle English *þer*, from **Wycliffe’s Bible** (1382), specifically, "each one in their craft is wise"
 * e/em/es, recommended by James Rogers in correspondence with **The Writer**, [January 1890](https://books.google.com/books?id=QQQ-AQAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false)
 * thon/thon/thon, recommended by [C. Crozat Converse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Crozat_Converse) in *That Impersonal Pronoun* in [September 1889](https://books.google.com/books?id=QQQ-AQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false)'s issue of the same journal

In addition to those, I couldn't find a specific citation, but people trace one/one/one's to the fifteenth century.  [**The Sacramento Bee**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacramento_Bee) used hir/hir/hirs somewhere around 1910.  And if you want to stick to science fiction, [**A Voyage to Arcturus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voyage_to_Arcturus) uses pronouns ae/aer/aes for a clade of gaseous humanoid organisms.

And those pronouns limit themselves to writings in the public domain however many years ago I started that research, so nothing after 1922.  It neglects the more modern gender-neutral pronouns (other than *they*) that we'd more likely recognize today.  Do you *really* want to tell me that they couldn't find a single pronoun to use for the translation?

Actually, wait.  Did we find another example where the crew has forced some random group of people to learn English to speak to them?  I ask, because Soren seems to think that they have responsibility for choosing the appropriate pronoun.  By contrast, if they used the translator, they could have programmed it to map their pronoun to anything---he, her, it, they, thon, whatever---and map every personal pronoun spoken by someone from the Federation to their preferred term.

Alternatively, if they have a word that works for them, then why not **use that word**?

Anyway, I'll use *they* to refer to Soren in this post, because I happen to agree that *it* sounds extremely inappropriate and---ironically given how much work I put into complaining about it---the issue of personal pronouns never comes up again in the episode until they have an excuse to ignore the cultural traditions and refer to Soren as "she."

 > **RIKER**: Then I'll just have to muddle through. So forgive me if a stray he or she slips by, OK?

No!  Arguing their choice of pronouns felt [microaggression](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microaggression)-y enough, but trying to get a blanket pardon for the lack of work that he *plans* to not put in takes that a few steps further into outright aggression.

In case anybody finds that confusing:  Don't *ever* do this.  Instead, apologize, try to do better in the future, and apologize when you get *those* wrong, too.  We all understand this in every other context.  If, after you correct me, I told you that I had trouble remembering your name, so forgive me now for all the times that I'll call you (random word...) [Bedewed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bedewed) in the future, you would probably suspect that I care about you.

 > **RIKER**: Split pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmed into the replicators. Well...?

Didn't he make a point of explaining that his father refused to cook or that he didn't like the food in [*Time Squared*]({% post_url 2023-02-16-time-squared %})?

 > **RIKER**: A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender.

How?  What could possibly make that difficult for him?  We have unisex animals *on Earth*, though we arbitrarily declare the individuals "female," because they give birth.  For examples, check out the [desert grassland whiptail lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_grassland_whiptail_lizard), the [marbled crayfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbled_crayfish), and the [silvery salamander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvery_salamander), among others, including invertebrates.  And that doesn't even get to the unicellular animals and other critters that [reproduce asexually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction).

In turn, that doesn't get to the energy-based and other inorganic life that they've discovered.  I mean, Data expresses a gender identity---one that happens to match his creator's---but does he *have* a gender?

 > **RIKER**: Snips and snails and puppy dog tails?

Look, if we absolutely must play this game, at *least* bring back Ruk to reference [*What Are Little Girls Made Of?*]({% post_url 2020-02-27-trek-girls %}).  For those of you familiar with the [nursery rhyme in question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Are_Little_Boys_Made_Of%3F), I'll let you listen to the insipid music, read there about "snips," and figure out why someone might associate snips with little boys, not to mention alternatives for people who realize that connection and don't approve, on your own time.

 > **RIKER**: It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to say that there's no real difference between them. Physically, men are bigger, stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs. Men can't bear young.
 >
 > **SOREN**: And what about feelings, or emotional attitudes? Are they different?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Most people think so. But that's the kind of question that would take a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planet where the people have no gender?

He really could've said *no*, right?  The **script** could've said no... %%% For reference, you can find plenty of women stronger than plenty of men.  Everybody, by definition, has "different" sexual organs.  And plenty of transgender men bear young.  Maybe we shouldn't trust anything that Riker has to say about the emotional differences...

 > **RIKER**: Well, who leads when you dance? If you dance.

Why the Hell would they have partner dances with gender roles and **no gender roles**?  Remember, they wrote and filmed this in the 1990s, not the 1950s.  I could maybe---stretching things a lot, but maybe---understand the question if Kirk had asked it in the original series, because parts of their audience might not have had direct experience with dances like [the Twist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_%28dance%29) and its imitators after only a few years in circulation, and people at the time did have concerns about the effects of such un-gendered dances on society for quite a while.  By the 1990s, though, we already knew that this didn't destroy society as we knew it, and shifted worries about the potential for injury in [moshing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing), so the writers really don't have an excuse on this one.

In other words, this goes far beyond the "which chopstick do I use as the fork?" joke in the United States, because it requires complete ignorance of---

Oh.

Yeah, I see it now.  In the United States, genderless partner dances didn't catch on until significantly after the 1930s.  For the record, I haven't the foggiest idea how seriously I mean that.  I can't fathom the idea that the writers actually intended for popular culture to end in 1940, but if they did, that *would* explain Riker not understanding the idea of dances that might not conform to a [lead and follow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_and_follow) form.

 > **RIKER**: Without the battle of the sexes you probably don't have as many arguments.

What a jackass.  Has Riker *really* mostly had differences of opinion with women?  Honestly, he probably thinks so, because his status and privilege let him ignore when somebody like Data, Worf, or La Forge disagrees with him.

Also, the [battle of the sexes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/battle_of_the_sexes) only exists, by definition, because of systemic sexism.  The "tension" comes directly from women wanting society to treat them like human beings, set against defenders of the status quo (or their successors) [questioning what fiery doom <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-women-democracy_n_5747079be4b03ede4413f6f5) such a step will lead us to.

 > **SOREN**: Tell me, is that the kind of woman that all human males prefer?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lot of energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Others couldn't care less. There are no rules.

And some human males---to my vague recollection---don't prefer woman at all.  I mean, seriously, has Riker *never* met any gay people?

 > **SOREN**: Commander, tell me about your sexual organs.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Er.
 >
 > **SOREN**: Is that an uncomfortable subject for humans?

Only when the other people ask, and he has no minors in the room...

Again, though, this goes back to something that we've seen since [*Justice*]({% post_url 2022-07-07-justice %}), I think, that the crew---especially Riker---loves to brag about sex and chase people around.  But as soon as somebody returns that aggression, they shrivel away in panic.

 > **RIKER**: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk...

Notice how dismissive he sounds, here.  And this, from the man who, only last week in [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), insisted that he *always* tries to keep an open mind about other cultures...

 > **RIKER**: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for an experience that's primitive.

Even for Riker, this line comes off as creepy.  Because a person had a vague interest in the idea of sex, it comes off like him recommending that they try it.

Actually, on that topic, I need to make a point of how much this relationship---*especially* Riker insisting that he doesn't understand the idea of a genderless creature and then suggesting that she'd probably prefer sex to her own form of reproduction---gives me the icky feeling of watching some creep meeting an asexual woman or lesbian and deciding that he can make her straight.

 > **SOREN**: You put color on your mouths, and your eyes, your cheeks, your fingernails. The men don't.

Apparently, the Federation neither includes any cultures where men generally wear cosmetics nor accepts men who might feel like doing so.  Or if not one of those, then Riker treats those men like he blustered his way through [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}), demanding that they abide by some imaginary dress code.

 > **CRUSHER**: No color. They like to pretend they're not doing anything to attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their minds.

How the heck did we---and I include Crusher in the plural pronoun---end up in this conversation...?

 > **CRUSHER**: Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time.

Do I really need to make a full list of the episodes where men have dismissed Crusher, specifically, as inferior in some way?  I won't, other than to maybe highlight [*Legacy*]({% post_url 2023-12-14-legacy %}) as one of the first times that she does so vocally, but you get the idea.  It happens a lot, and sometimes she pushes back against it, so this line seems absurdly out of character.  She'll even do so later in *this episode*.

Related, it feels like the episode comes *so* close to gesturing at it, but I wish that it had come closer to explicitly pointing out how most bigotry either redirects misogyny or rests on a foundation of misogyny.  In this episode, for example, we see how the microaggressions against Soren mostly come from Riker's discomfort at not knowing whether he should treat them like a prospective romantic partner or more like a "normal person."  And Soren later gestures at how their culture wants to protect its (genderless) purity, echoing how often racism pitches itself as preventing "those people" from seducing women.  The episode has the parts to make that argument within its allegory, but as it often does, seems uninterested in connecting the dots.

 > **TROI**: Well, the Federation was founded in twenty-one sixty-one, so, twos, sixes, and aces are wild.

[*The Neutral Zone*]({% post_url 2022-11-10-neutral-zone %}) set the end of the first season of this show in 2364, so that gives us some idea of the age of the organization.

Also, do people really play poker like this, giving each hand a name[^3] and then invent rules to fit it after somebody asks?  I find the game boring, so that may well happen, but it seems like an odd choice to back-door an argument over gender roles where everybody avoids expressing an opinion.

[^3]:  A *bad* name, no less.  Unless the founding of the Federation coincided with catching up on hundreds of forgotten leap years, 2161 doesn't sound much like a "day."

 > **SOREN**: On our world these feelings are forbidden. Those who are discovered are shamed and ridiculed, and only by undergoing psychotectic therapy and having all elements of gender eliminated can they become accepted into society again. Those of us who have these urges live secret and guarded lives. We seek each other out, always hiding, always terrified of being discovered.

Bits like this make me wonder what the heck happened to this episode.  Soren makes a case, here, for seeing her situation as parallel to most out-groups in human history, especially those representing gender and sexual minorities.  As her story goes on, she'll also allude to [conversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy) and the toll it takes on its victims.  The episode definitely knows its metaphor, then, and want us to side with Soren and people like them...but we'll see that it completely fumbles in the end.

 > **LAFORGE**: That's it, Commander, everything checks out. The energy buffer is installed and functioning. I estimate it should reduce the power drain to your systems by about forty percent.

...When did La Forge grow a mustache and beard?  Did I miss this?  It feels like this show would make a big deal about it.  Does it *matter*?  No, it doesn't.  Probably.

 > **CRUSHER**: They've been oxygen deprived. There doesn't seem to be any significant damage. Prepare some dexalin.

While still not made from generic drug stems, the drug in this case does have a name comparable to [adrenaline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline) and [catecholamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine), suggesting that they mean a stress or other hormone.

 > **RIKER**: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable in crowded rooms.

Then doesn't a career trapped in small containers seem like an impressively bad life choice?

 > **TROI**: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one of my father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turned up.

That all seems remarkably well-preserved for decades-old junk that nobody kept track of for all that time.  Does Earth no longer have any humidity, microbes, or variations in temperature?

 > **NOOR**: Commander Riker, these proceedings are closed to everyone.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I think I just opened them.

Sure, why respect their laws while in their territory?

I mean, I'd also scream if they all turned their backs on somebody from an oppressed minority---and yes, that will happen shortly, too---but ignoring local sovereignty seems like an extremely consistent theme to this series.

 > **SOREN**: I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, those longings, all of my life. It is not unnatural. I am not sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding and your compassion. We have not injured you in any way. And yet, we are scorned and attacked. And all because we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk and laugh. We complain about work, and we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what we do. And for that we are called misfits and deviants and criminals. What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?

A round of applause for [Melinda Culea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_Culea), by the way, then known mostly as a recurring character (Amy Allen) on **The A-Team**.  She goes all-in (since they threw in a poker scene) on this monologue, and does a great job of skirting the boundary between actually realistic and theatrical enough that it survives the prosthetics, the recording, and transmission into a lot of homes that probably couldn't care less.

Keep in mind the context, here.  Same-sex marriage had become an issue, in the United States, over the course of the Reagan administration, because of their complete botching of the AIDS epidemic raising the question of how to manage death benefits for people who can't get married.  This led to a hodgepodge of state and local laws.  The irrational fear over same-sex marriage[^2] led to the drafting and overwhelming passage of the---obscene, frankly, and unconstitutional---[Defense of Marriage Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) about four years after the episode.

[^2]:  I had to oversimplify the situation a lot, including attempts to compromise by asking for civil unions, only to have that idea shot down angrily by Republicans, not to mention Bill Clinton feeling forced to sign the law in the face of a veto-proof majority, even as he criticized it and warned about its consequences.

We can see in retrospect that the pitch had no chance of success with so much of the country actively ignoring the problems of people who we probably all knew in our lives---but didn't know that we knew them, because they didn't feel at all safe expressing that among people who would (at a minimum) happily vote against their rights---but I give Culea credit for trying.

 > **PICARD**: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibited by the Prime Directive.

Well, he folded quickly enough.  Once again, oppression and political violence committed by allies doesn't matter, because they have a law to hide behind and probably a good trade deal to protect.

I mean, seriously, the original series and certain episodes of this series make it consistently sound like the Prime Directive prevented the Federation from accidentally starting UFO cults, and *our* history suggests that it probably prevents them from engaging in settler-colonialism that uses some euphemism for enslaving the local population while extracting the planet's resources, but Picard mostly seems to use it as a blindfold, so that he can go back to not caring about non-humans.

 > **RIKER**: OK. Excuse me. I need to speak to her alone for a moment.

Why do they always pick the absolute worst way to solve problems?  They could have made their ongoing help with the null space thingie contingent on freeing these people, or negotiated treaties, or even *asked nicely*, but they went with fisticuffs and abduction.

 > **PICARD**: I didn't know when to tell them we will be there. Is our business with the J'naii finished?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Finished, sir.

And because Riker can't get a girlfriend out of the deal, the overt oppression and political violence stops mattering.  Bravo, everyone...

Not to belabor the point, but they seem to make a point of wanting us to *like* Number One, but he involved himself in a minor's love life in [*The Dauphin*]({% post_url 2023-01-26-dauphin %}), [*Violations*]({% post_url 2024-08-01-violations %}) strongly suggested that he doesn't really worry about the enthusiasm of his partners, and now he has stopped caring about a serious political issue because his prospective sexual partner rejected him **after** undergoing conversion therapy.

## Conclusions

We now have an idea of the Federation's age, and that parents still circulate the worst nursery rhymes.

### The Good

They *do*, obliquely, grudgingly admit that oppressing gender and sexual minorities doesn't make for an ideal situation, I suppose.

### The Bad

They continue to not take their work seriously, both in sending the most academically disinclined person to formalize new branches of physics, and in the usual playing games while apparently on duty.

The meat of the episode, though, focuses on everybody's complete disregard for gender minorities.  Picard seems to choke on the word "androgynous" in his log.  Riker piles on a series of microaggressions in refusing to accept the J'naii preferred pronouns or in grasping the central concept in not dividing people between genders, not to mention denying the value in their approach to mating and reproduction.  Most importantly, once they no longer have a chance at bedding someone in that oppressed group who they find attractive, they immediately stop caring about that oppression.

It also appears that the crew has insisted on communicating with the J'naii exclusively in English, putting the burden of translations on them.

We also see plenty of sexism, with Riker and Crusher each outlining the boundaries of a highly sexist society that they also refuse to admit exists.  They don't acknowledge the existence of anybody outside the strictest 1990s American gender roles, either.

And we continue to see that they like to use the Prime Directive to declare large-scale oppression somebody else's problem.

The crew continues to disregard the laws of the sovereign governments hosting them.  And when that doesn't work, they commit violence.

### The Weird

People consider working in Starfleet more similar to the outdoors than to crowded rooms.

## Next

Come back next week, when Picard would rather stay in a time loop where he keeps dying than talk to a therapist (admittedly from another media franchise), in *Cause and Effect*.
