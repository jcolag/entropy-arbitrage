To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Wuffle**
 * Location:  <https://wufflecomics.tumblr.com/>
 * Released:  2012 -- 2015 (or maybe 2021)
 * License:  CC0
 * Creator:  Piti Yindee
 * Medium:  Web comic
 * Length:  Approximately 
 * Content Advisories:  Some (mildly) coarse language

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Wuffle

The creator of the comic describes it as follows.

> **Wuffle** is different from other wolves. While most wolves are sneaky and tricky, Wuffle is innocent, naive, and kind-hearted, always willing to help people without expecting anything in return.
>
> **Wuffle** was actually one of the projects that started back in the year 2008. At that time, he was designed to be the main character of the game with the same name.
>
> The game is a parody of many famous fairy tales with a wolf in the story, such as the Three Little Pigs, and the Little Red Riding Hood.
>
> It was supposed to be a platformer game about Wuffle fighting the three evil pigs, stopping them from destroying his land and turn the land into big factories.
>
> Unfortunately, we never actually had time to work on the project, and it eventually got cancelled.
>
> However, I was really in love with Wuffle’s design. I want to see him comes to life in some form. If he can’t be in a game, then he can be in something else. And that’s when I started working on the Wuffle comics project.
>
> Finally, after 4 years, I think I have found the perfect story for him. I just want to see him comes to life, see him living his little adventure with his friends. And here it is, in your hand, the comic as you can see today.
>
> I want Wuffle to be a comic for everyone. I want to bring back the old charms of the good old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young.
>
> I hope you enjoy the comic, and will come to love Wuffle the same way that I have.
>
> Welcome to the world of Wuffle, the big heart wolf!

I have actually had this on my radar for a while, but somehow kept forgetting about it for some reason.

## What Works Well?

While some might disagree with my praising this, this batch of strips gives more of an impression of highly polished story boards for a cartoon.  We actually have some action, rather than abstractions of an action and a reaction shot.

Additionally, we do start to see some of the side-characters show up for non-filler reasons.  I'd argue that it still had room to improve, but I still want to call out that progress.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

As the longer stories become more frequent and longer, it feels like they might have also become overly ambitious.  I point to the two-part Christmas story, for example, taking twenty pages.  A couple of pages from the first part go to introducing us to most characters who we have seen---many still not really fleshed out---and then the second half spends a couple of its pages seemingly doing nothing but recounting earlier comics.

## Opportunities

The author appears go have moved on from the comic, but does have an active [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/pitiyindee) working on a traditional hand-animated cartoon for a different wolf character.

## What's Adaptable?

I believe that we see Foxxo's Mart, Foxxo Mall, the radio cooking show **Feed Me, If You Dare**, and HHD Foofoo's *Shellock House* detective novels including **Shellock House and the Four Ninjas**.  Lime Chat seems to exist, as a proprietary Windows IRC client.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up reading **Wuffle**, moving on to the comics archived for 2015.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
