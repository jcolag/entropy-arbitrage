## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## A Matter of Time

This episode mostly concerns it with its dual plots, but you know how this goes...

 > Captain's log, stardate 45349.1. The Enterprise is on its way to Penthara Four, where a type C asteroid has struck an unpopulated continent. The resulting dust cloud could very well create a phenomenon not unlike the nuclear winters of twenty-first century Earth. Commander La Forge has begun work on a plan that would counteract the devastation.

I can't find any prior reference for the star's name, but [nuclear winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter) came into the public imagination during the 1980s, the idea that nuclear war would result in dropping the amount of solar energy that enters Earth's atmosphere, severely cooling the world.  As far as I can tell, nobody has ever really managed to validate the premise, and a lot of the early math stopped making sense around when this episode aired.

Even so, it has come back into casual conversation *not* as an anti-war concern, but in the guise of [climate engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering), suggesting that we can briefly slow down Global Warming at the tiny cost of starving plenty of people and making solar power less viable.  No, really, we have an entire fleet of wealthy people who adore the idea of polluting the atmosphere so that they can keep burning coal.

 > **DATA**: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely, given the time frame.

Did anybody *ask* him?  If not, and he thought that he needed to volunteer the chances of low-probability events, why does he not constantly mention that they probably won't get dragged into black holes, probably won't spontaneously disintegrate, probably won't turn into cacti...?

 > **WORF**: They want you to move over, sir.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Reply that the *Enterprise* isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant.

We don't have a *real* episode of the show, unless Picard petulantly refuses to take orders from an alien.

 > **RASMUSSEN**: Oops. Excuse me, Captain, but you were standing right where I needed to be.

You may recognize Rasmussen as [Matt Frewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Frewer), who despite a lengthy career, people mostly know him from his work as (fictional) artificial intelligence [Max Headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom)...allegedly coming back on AMC, at some point.

 > **RASMUSSEN**: Where I come from, every historian knows the bridge of old 1701-D.

That comment seems highly disturbing, as does Picard's acceptance of the idea.  I mean, seriously consider:  How many military locations of any sort do historians know intimately?  I can't think of any reason to do so other than military reenactment or...well, fan fiction.

 > **PICARD**: You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room can possibly be of interest to future historians.

He *finally* figured something out at the beginning of an episode.  And he'll immediately dismiss that concern, because flattery works with small-minded people...

 > **CRUSHER**: The telurian plague. Was it cured? I mean, did they find the cure by your century? Oh, it can't do any harm to ask that.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I realize that it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselves questions regarding the future. Go on, Professor.

Notice which member of the crew triggered Picard's "we shouldn't ask questions about the future" reflex.

 > **PICARD**: I realize that this visit is going to be difficult for some of us, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be in order, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy.

How the **heck** did Picard decide that future credentials looked "in order"?  What would that even mean to him?  I mean, if he has questions, I feel like you can answer them to his satisfaction by saying "yeah, we do some weird things in the future.  It only looks like crayon scrawl on a napkin."

 > **DATA**: If you're referring to the first production model automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent Model A might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong's revised prototype.

Actually, wouldn't Lore look more like an unsold prototype?  I mean, if we need to waste time on time-wasting pedantry, here, why can't we do it accurately...?

Anyway, you presumably don't need me to tell you about Ford's [Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T) or (second) [Model A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_%281927%E2%80%9331%29).  However, as long as I already started nitpicking this nonsense, I should note that Ford actually sold several lines of cars *before* the Model T, but Ford *mass-produced* the T, important because of that, rather than because of the existence of the automobile.  If we must draw an analogy between Soong and Ford, then Lore looks more like the [Quadricycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Quadricycle), hand-built, low quantity, and barely known, and Data the (original) [Model A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_%281903%E2%80%9304%29), the alleged reliable product that barely worked...

 > **PICARD**: We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide, here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of the sun.
 >
 > **MOSELEY**: We've spent years, decades, trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect and now here we are about to create one on purpose.

Take what I said about climate engineering above, and apply it here in reverse, I guess.

Honestly, this plot actually angers me in how blithely it thinks that you can---and *should*---tinker with ecosystems to get immediate and beneficial changes.  They act like smoke and dust will instantly cool the planet to freezing immediately, as if they've never experienced a cloudy sky or *night* before, and also think that [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas)...I guess trap and *generate* heat so quickly that you can see the effects in an afternoon rather than decades.

And in doing this, it also completely ignores the actual threat of nuclear winter, the lack of solar radiation to grow crops and otherwise store energy, in favor of interpreting it as some sort of atomic-powered winter...

 > **RASMUSSEN**: You know, Homer was blind, and Milton. Bach, Monet, Wonder.

[Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer), among other things wrote the epic poems **The Iliad** and **The Odyssey**.  [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton) wrote the epic poem **Paradise Lost**.  [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) wrote many late-Baroque orchestral pieces.  [Oscar-Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet) started the impressionist art movement.  The aberration on the list whose work has *not* fallen into the public domain, [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder), born Stevland Hardaway Judkins, quickly became one of the twentieth century's most influential musicians, making the R&B genre more accessible by embracing electronic music, who at the time that this aired, would have had an extra boost in popularity due to his work in Spike Lee's **Jungle Fever**.

Normally, I'd point out that we don't generally consider it polite conversation to say "hey, I can actually name people with disabilities similar to yours," but we don't really see much of the reaction, so they seem to have included the exchange to show Rasmussen as awkward.

That said, I wonder if they meant the line to tip us off to the twist, here.  The typical form of this line generally lists the two or three most famous people of the intended class, followed by an unknown name meant to (poorly) imply the broader diversity of the Federation.  Here, we boost the list to *five*, and the "alien" slot goes to a Black guy who, at that time, probably got recognized---both for his musical talent and his vision issues---more than everybody else on the list combined.  Maybe the writers only wanted to list every famous person with vision problems that they could think of, but maybe they did this to make us suspicious that Rasmussen comes from a less-pluralistic world than the crew does.

 > **LAFORGE**: The Enterprise will monitor the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at six different altitudes. If all goes well, it shouldn't take more than twenty bore sites.

I refuse to believe that future professionals will refer to chemicals by the representation of chemical formulae, if only because they don't always provide an unambiguous term, because it doesn't give any indication of the structure.  It doesn't really matter in the case of carbon dioxide, because carbon doesn't allow for much flexibility in structure with small molecules, but once you start talking about molecules that include [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28chemistry%29), for example, counting atoms doesn't tell you anything about the molecule.

 > **RASMUSSEN**: Picard's empath won't trust you. That's what they all said.
 >
 > **TROI**: Picard's empath?

This seems to indicate that Troi's mindlessly subservient role shows through in-universe, rather than poor handling of the character.

 > **DATA**: Both epicenters are beneath the two southernmost drill sites, Captain.

You could almost believe that drilling random holes in the surface of a planet to release pressurized gases might cause problems...

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter symphony in C major, Bach's Brandenburg Concerto number three, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, second movement, molto vivace and *La Donna e Mobile* from Verdi's **Rigoletto**.

Mozart finished [Symphony No. 41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._41_%28Mozart%29), his longest, near the end of his life, nicknamed *The Jupiter Symphony* sometime after.  Bach, mentioned above due to his eyesight, composed the [Brandenburg Concertos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concertos) at probably the height of his career.  Beethoven composed his [Symphony No. 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_%28Beethoven%29) near the end of his life, and has become so famous that you probably recognize the fourth movement's *Ode to Joy*, which itself---along with the poem by the same name by [Friedrich Schiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller)---has become a protest anthem around the world.  [**Rigoletto**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigoletto), based on Victor Hugo's [**Le roi s'amuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_roi_s%27amuse), where [*La donna è mobile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_donna_%C3%A8_mobile) ("The Lady Is Fickle") has gone from a cynical song showcasing the opera's tenor to, through its popularity among Venetian gondoliers, a stereotype of "Italian music" that you've probably heard played in pizzerias.

Notably, Verdi obsessed over keeping *La donna è mobile* secret, even from the cast of the opera, because he considered the melody so catchy that everybody would copy it if it "leaked" before the premiere.  Apparently, he made the right call, because accounts generally say that people hummed and whistled it in the streets for weeks, before the gondoliers picked it up.

 > **PICARD**: Turn the *Enterprise* into a lightning rod?
 >
 > **DATA**: Precisely, sir.

Does Data not actually know what "precision" means?  A lighting rod seems like an acceptable analogy, but the lack of lightning and grounded circuits make it fairly imprecise.  I wouldn't bring this up if anybody else had gotten the line, but Data doesn't really have a personality trait other than pedantry, even when he has his facts wrong, such as the earlier discussion of Ford automobile models.

 > **PICARD**: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for, everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask you that. But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, and you know what happened to them. What will happen to them.

Picard absolutely will not ask for future information to cheat the mission...except for the part where he'll not only ask, but go on to demand that future information.

I don't want to imply that he definitely has an inappropriate impulse, here, but I care more about his hypocrisy and insistence that his whim should overrule his guest's principles than I do about his sudden curiosity about the ability to come to the rescue.

 > **PICARD**: Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save down there is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked that question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this is not a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's not hypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that?

I assume that I don't need to explain [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) to anybody.  Singh, we met in [*Space Seed*]({% post_url 2020-06-11-seed %}) and spent a bunch of time with in [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %}).

Meanwhile, Picard somehow manages to turn around the thought experiment to, I guess, challenge each of us to ask why we don't murder the babies in our lives, knowing that any of them could plausibly become a mass murderer or tyrant[^1].

[^1]:  Don't kill babies.  If anybody needed me to take a stand on the issue, I strongly disapprove of extrajudicial infanticide.  On the other hand, since I typed "murdering babies" multiple times and deleted it every time (except this one) because of the ambiguity---the act of doing so or a certain kind of young person---we should consider a baby who murders innocent until proven guilty...

 > **PICARD**: Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us that we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien worlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I have disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thought it was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to some temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help me to choose, because it's the right thing to do?

Also, since at least [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-26-farpoint2 %}), [*Code of Honor*]({% post_url 2022-06-09-code-honor %}), [*Justice*]({% post_url 2022-07-07-justice %}), and consistently since, Picard has shown that he neither understands nor respects the law that he swore to uphold, so his disregarding it doesn't make the impact here that he probably meant it to.  In fact, the only times that he has invoked it---[*Symbiosis*]({% post_url 2022-10-13-symbiosis %}), [*Pen Pals*]({% post_url 2023-03-02-pen-pals %}), [*Who Watches the Watchers?*]({% post_url 2023-05-25-who-watches-watchers %}), and so forth---he has done so precisely so that he could turn his back on someone else's suffering, often giving Crusher almost exactly the lecture that Rasmussen gives him here.

 > **PICARD**: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I ask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday on Corsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of a thousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believe that if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books, then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor, perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is my future and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet.

The show inflicted Risa on us first in [*Captain's Holiday*]({% post_url 2023-09-07-captain-s-holiday %}), and it seems telling that Picard compares it to [Corsica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica), a Mediterranean island primarily known as the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte and its [separatist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_nationalism) that has occasionally turned to violence.

Mostly, though, notice Picard's thinking, here, trying to equate choosing a date to a school dance (apparently something he does often) or selecting a vacation resort with deciding whether to allow some large number of people---I don't think that we ever learned the size of the colony---to die.

 > **PICARD**: By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice I had to begin with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play it safe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose is. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try. Mister Data, program the firing sequence.

Wait.  Because he needs to choose, he has decided to choose recklessly, so that he'll feel more empowered by the choice?

Yeah, OK, now that I see it written out, that does sound a lot like Picard...

 > **DATA**: Activating shield inverters, now.

Does this scene and Data's comment indicate, here, that Starfleet ships can use their shields as weapons?  Why would anybody design such a thing...?

 > **RASMUSSEN**: This was all a misunderstanding, Picard. Just let me back in there and we'll forget the whole thing.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that?

I wonder how many of Rasmussen's now never-born descendants account for important-seeming characters who we've met and never seen again, quietly removed from the time-stream, because he never fathered their ancestors.  No, seriously, Picard's decision seems fairly reckless, for the same reasons that he vaguely understood Rasmussen's alleged reluctance to help.

## Conclusions

I spent most of this post hunting down references, but...

### The Bad

Data now seems to speak to hear his own voice, whether volunteering non-information that helps nobody, making pedantic but incorrect corrections, agreeing with bad analogies, and so forth.

Picard, likewise, spends a lot of the episode trying to validate his strength, refusing to make minor concessions for unknown people and insisting that time travelers have a duty to abandon their principles to help him.  However, he shuts down a far lower stakes question, when Crusher raises it in hopes of getting proof of the situation.  He seems to believe that people should see his missions as so important, that future historians will memorize the layout of the *Enterprise* bridge, and seems to think that he can identify invalid credentials from the future.  And he seems to believe that he needs to take the riskiest path in any choice, to prove that he had the power to endanger lives.

Viewed from the outside, people see Troi as Picard's lackey, using her abilities for his personal benefit.

We also get a reminder that people don't really respect the Prime Directive, taking its violation as a point in favor of their morality.  And, in fact, an outsider gives Picard a similar reprimand over his lack of understanding the principle as he often does his subordinates.

### The Weird

The crew absolutely has no comprehension of how climate works.  They also talk about molecules as chemical formula.

## Next

Come back in a week, when we ask what happened to Worf's family, in *New Ground*.
