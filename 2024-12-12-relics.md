## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Relics

You can read up on [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere) on your own time, which this episode weirdly misrepresents as a "theory," for some reason, considering that Dyson considered it more a thought experiment[^1].  It seems kind of funny to me that so many people remember the episode for this, and most people probably know the concept from this episode, even though it has no effect on anything that a hundred different plot devices didn't already have in prior episodes...

[^1]:  I wouldn't call it relevant at all, hence the useless footnote, but it occurs to me that they might have used the "theory" framing, because it fits better with Picard's "the future means that we take myths and legends extremely seriously" vibe.

Otherwise, I should probably mention that the show decided to finally lift its effective prohibition on stories that heavily reference the original series, here, so expect a deluge to make up for lost time.

 > **DATA**: Captain, I have identified the signal. It is from the USS *Jenolan*, a Federation transport ship reported missing in this sector seventy-five years ago.

One imagines that they named the ship after the [Australian town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenolan,_New_South_Wales) known for its [caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenolan_Caves) and [river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenolan_River).

 > **RIKER**: This air's pretty stale.

They *did* tell him that the ship vanished decades ago and had life support on some minimum setting.  I mock Riker for never preparing for the missions, but he got this information *one elevator ride* ago...

{% imgr Montgomery Scott|scotty.png|Might as well make use of the old publicity shots, right? %}

 > **SCOTT**: Thank you, lad. We've got to get Franklin out of there.

We all remember Mr. Scott, right, happy to meet the tyrants behind the Eugenics Wars and always looking for an excuse to shoot at aliens?

 > **SCOTT**: The *Enterprise*? I should have known. I bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old girl out of mothballs to come looking for me. Captain Montgomery Scott. Tell me, how long have I been missing?

They hadn't even considered writing the film when this aired, as far as I know, but having watched things out of order, we know that Scott **should** believe that he witnessed Kirk's death on the *Enterprise*-B shortly before he retired and left on the *Jenolan*.  That doesn't fall in our scope, but it seemed worth a brief mention...and it *does* raise the question of why nobody searched for the missing ship.

I mean, I feel pretty confident in asserting that nobody searched for it, given that they knew its origin point and destination, and the Dyson shenanigans happened along the way when the ship needed to drop out of warp.  But an entire solar system along the route still managed to completely surprise the *Enterprise*-D, presumably meaning that nobody bothered to follow their course.

Later in the franchise, assuming that we consider the Guardian of Forever's props literal and not a series of Easter eggs for our benefit, the newspaper that he shows in **Discovery**'s *Terra Firma* arc would tell us that the ship got some publicity for vanishing.  If we trust "Carl," it makes even less sense that they wouldn't have already found the ship, because you don't generally ignore missing people like that after the press has gotten hold of the story...

 > **SCOTT**: Lieutenant?

I have to laugh (and sob a bit) about how often they illustrate the changes in the future by having somebody act completely shocked at someone from an enemy culture treated like a peer, as if they think that racism never changes in any way.

 > **LAFORGE**: Yeah, but locking it into a diagnostic cycle so that the pattern wouldn't degrade, and then cross-connecting the phase inducers to provide a regenerative power source, that's absolutely brilliant.
 >
 > **SCOTT**: I think it was only fifty percent brilliant. Franklin deserved better.

I have to appreciate Scott pointing this out.  The crew too often gets wrapped up in the details while ignoring the human cost of their actions.

 > **SCOTT**: Thank you. Well, I'll say this about your *Enterprise*. The doctors are a fair sight prettier.

Can *nobody* push back on acting this creepy?

I mean, I don't disagree, but you **do not** comment on the appearance of professionals at work.  People do that to undermine the professional status of women.  And yes, that makes sense coming from Scott, because he has a misogynistic streak that the original series explicitly told us about, but nobody in the room tells him that "we don't talk like that anymore, grandpa," or even roll their eyes...

 > **SCOTT**: Bigger? In my day, even an Admiral wouldn't have had such quarters on a starship. You know, I remember a time we had to transport the Dohlman of Elaas. You never heard anyone whine and complain so much about quarters as she did.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **SCOTT**: You know, these quarters remind me of a hotel room on Argelius. Oh, now there is a planet. Everything a man wants right at his fingertips. Of course, on the first visit, I got into a wee bit of trouble.

As seen in [*Elaan of Troyius*]({% post_url 2021-05-13-elaan %}) and [*Wolf in the Fold*]({% post_url 2020-11-12-wolf %}).  Scott quietly elides the part where he got to Argelius because Kirk thought sending him to a sex worker would fix his misogyny, and it seems unfortunate that La Forge doesn't recognize the similarity between the former and [*The Perfect Mate*]({% post_url 2024-10-03-perfect-mate %}), which only happened a few months prior...

 > **SCOTT**: I was a Starfleet engineer for fifty-two years, Mister La Forge. I think I'm still useful.

Also, I feel the need to point something out that the crew often overlooks when dealing with time:  Scott's engineering only happened *hours ago*, by his experience.  They make it seem like he probably fell out of practice, rather than that he only needs to familiarize himself with new gadgets.

 > **SCOTT**: I remember a time when the old *Enterprise* was spiraling in toward Psi Two Thousand.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **SCOTT**: The Captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines. I told him that without a proper phase lock it would take at least thirty minutes You canna change the laws of physics, I told him, but he wouldn't believe me, so I had to come up with a new engine start-up routine. Do you know that your dilithium crystals are going to fracture?

As seen in [*The Naked Time*]({% post_url 2020-02-06-trek-naked-time %}), which the crew should recognize, given that they needed to research it to get through [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}).  And by the way, I feel like, if you want to impress people, you don't leave out the part of the story where that "new engine start-up routine" led you to accidentally invent time travel.

 > **SCOTT**: You didn't tell him how long it would really take, did you?

Yes.  Always give people good estimates.  You do that, because---and I feel like I've ranted about this before, probably with [**The Search for Spock**]({% post_url 2024-07-18-new-ground %}) which this scene references---other people *depend* on your estimates to make their plans.  In any real situation, a "miracle" comes too late, no matter how unexpectedly soon you produce it, because the team has committed to a different plan after you told them that you'd take too long.

Think about this in a more mundane context, such as dining out.  You go to a restaurant, already hungry, and the front desk tells you that it'll take more than two hours to seat you.  But they multiplied their estimates by a factor of four, so in half an hour...you already left twenty-five minutes ago, because you needed food, so they don't have anybody to show their big "miracle."  They lost customers and failed to improve their reputation.

Likewise, when an engineer tries to look heroic by padding estimates, it makes the plan seem unworkable, so people abandon it for something more reliable.

 > **SCOTT**: Synthehol?
 >
 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute now being served aboard starships. It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of alcohol, but the intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed.

Synthehol first got a mention in [*Up the Long Ladder*]({% post_url 2023-03-23-up-long-ladder %}), complete with the insistence that "real drinkers" can tell the difference instantly and don't like it.  Picard's brother in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}) made a similar comment.  In the former episode, they mentioned that everybody has permission to override the replicator's substitution and get alcohol, but the fact that Data needs to scavenge for a bottle suggests that may have changed.

Back discussing [*Lonely Among Us*]({% post_url 2022-06-30-lonely %}), I pointed out the weird ethics of replicated meat, technically treating animals humanely, but also training people to value animals for flavor without any consequences.  Here, they present us with a similar dilemma of hypothesizing a world where people can drink to excess whenever they please---and possibly indulge in other simulated drugs that network standards of the day wouldn't allow them to show---without consequences.  But this does have predictable consequences, particularly one consequence that we've noted so many times before in the series:  People go to the bar to drink in the middle of their shifts, instead of working.  The overall idea feels like they meant it to evoke Aldous Huxley's [soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_%28Brave_New_World%29), but then forgot the point of the novel...

In other words, why would they create something like this?  I can assume that the *writers* created it because they liked the idea of an on-ship bar---the eleventh and final season of **Cheers** would've started around when this season did---but would want "plausible deniability," if networks started getting antsy about on-screen alcohol use on a show with children in the target audience.  But the Federation doesn't seem to have as much of an incentive.

 > **SCOTT**: What is it?
 >
 > **DATA**: It is...It is...It is *green*.

This scene, for those who might've overlooked it, echoes Scott himself drinking with Tomar in [*By Any Other Name*]({% post_url 2021-01-07-any-name %}#:~:text=It's green), an episode that we rarely talk about.  (If you have a current browser, that link *should* jump you to and even highlight the relevant line.)

 > **COMPUTER**: Program complete. Enter when ready.

Back when this aired, everybody considered this scene a *massive* achievement, by the way, reconstructing the original bridge---integrating at least fan replicas, matte paintings, old footage, clever camera angles, and blue-screens, if you look close---for really only this scene on a tight budget.  In a few years, competing franchise **Babylon 5** would largely pioneer the use of virtual sets as a routine tool, and today, almost anybody can find an artist able to build a 3D model of any old set and insert performers digitally, with big studios shifting to the even stranger [on-set virtual production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-set_virtual_production) method, so the scene falls a bit flatter than it should.  But thirty years ago, this looked like the future of genre fiction.

 > **PICARD**: The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called the *Stargazer*. It was an overworked, under-powered vessel, always on the verge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable sense, my *Enterprise* is far superior. But there are times when I would give almost anything to command the *Stargazer* again.

He received the salvaged *Stargazer* as a gift in [*The Battle*]({% post_url 2022-07-14-battle %}), so I don't see his problem, if he'd rather do that...

 > **LAFORGE**: It's possible. He does know those systems better than any of us. I'll have Lieutenant Bartel beam down with him.

Wow, he *really* likes to push awkward people onto colleagues.  I might not even notice, given how often it happens, except for how aggressively he did so in a recent episode that also hinged on people stranded mid-transport, [*Realm of Fear*]({% post_url 2024-11-28-realm-fear %}).  He gets extremely dismissive when they meet up, too, almost groaning every time Scott speaks.

 > **DATA**: Approximately ninety million kilometers from the star's photosphere. I am reading a great deal of surface instability. It may be---
 >
 > **RAGER**: Sir! The inertial motion from the tractor beams is still carrying us forward. Impulse engines are offline and I can't stop our momentum. We're falling directly into the star.

OK, but it takes around eight minutes for *light* to travel that distance, as I assume that most of us know living about that distance from our own local star.  They should have time to figure this out, probably a few months, at least, unless...

 > **DATA**: We will enter the sun's photosphere in three minutes.

Wait, *what*?  How much force did that tractor beam use, if it had them traveling faster than the speed of light?

I mean, it doesn't matter for our purposes, but we live in a unique time to talk about this, because the [Parker Solar Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe), the fastest human-made object to date, will reach the Sun next year (2025) after its launch in 2018.  Travel takes time; the ship has a "warp drive," specifically because the writers don't want to deal with the time.  And yet, the episode seems to want to suggest that you could "fall" to the Sun in less time than it takes to soft-boil an egg...

 > **SCOTT**: Forget it. I wrote it. A good engineer is always a wee bit conservative, at least on paper. Just bypass the secondary cut-off valve and boost the flow. It'll work.

On top of his terrible estimates that caused managers to choose suboptimal plans, think about how many members of Starfleet probably died because Scott wrote deceptive specifications.  A good engineer *actually* specifies the safety margins and why they exist, rather than lying about the limits.  Though you'll notice that this fits neatly with his lying about estimates, in that it allows him to have more information than any of his colleagues, with nobody bothering to check his work.

 > **LAFORGE**: So, this alien space baby, which was about the size of a four-story building, really thought the *Enterprise* was its mother.

As seen in [*Galaxy's Child*]({% post_url 2024-02-22-galaxy-s-child %}).

 > **LAFORGE**: No, really. It was suckling power directly from the ship's fusion reactors, so Doctor Brahms and I changed the power frequency from twenty-one centimeters to point oh two centimeters.

Don't forget the part when she found the AI porn about her...

 > **SCOTT**: Laddie, every woman has her own charm. You just have to know where to look for it.

I promise you, the world will keep on turning if men stop acting this creepy.

## Conclusions

We don't get much out of this...unless you wanted more explaining references.

### The Bad

The episode continues to show us that at least certain people refuse to prepare for missions, ignoring information delivered moments ago to express surprise at the situations that they find.  Similarly, people jump to overlook the consequences of their failures, especially when they can get excited about a technology-based solution.

It still looks like space travel carries such risk that a lost ship doesn't get much attention.

Racism and sexism rear their ugly heads, here, with nobody reacting to an older person saying demeaning things, except to occasionally grin at him.  They do dismiss his opinions and technical input, however, on the basis that they see him as an old man, and treating him as an obstacle to getting work done.

Management, likewise, seems to still involve a lot of finding somebody else to take care of their problems while the manager does the work that they enjoy.

At least Starfleet, and possibly the broader engineering profession, relies on exaggerated specifications for equipment without verifying the data.

### The Weird

They continue to use their fake alcohol.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when messy hair abounds to represent sleep deprivation due to alien abduction, in *Schisms*.
