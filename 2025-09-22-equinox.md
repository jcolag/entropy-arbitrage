Today, we have the "September equinox," where no matter in the world you happen to sit right now, you'll get twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness.  In the Northern Hemisphere, we call it autumnal or vernal.  In the Southern Hemisphere, the spring.

If you want something more mundane, we also observe [World Car-Free Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car-free_days) today, though more in the sense of recommending that people not drive, rather than mandating it like many regional versions of the day do.

![People doing recreational activities at the Car-Free Sundays at Ayala Avenue in Makati, Philippines](/blog/assets/Ayala-Ave-Car-Free-2.png "I gather, from my years speaking to Filipino folks regularly, that a scene like this on a normal day would usually only show cars, probably either in gridlock of moving so fast that you risk creating an undertow on the sidewalks...")

With that, on to the week's projects.

## Mini-Server, Part 11

On a whim, I probably won't play often, but I decided that I occasionally need a game that won't take much attention or time---you know, the sort of thing that one might kick off for a phone call, so that they have something else happening but nothing that will distract too much from the conversation---and settled on installing [Hextris](https://github.com/Hextris/hextris) on the server.  It didn't need any NGINX work, since it only loads normal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, *but* the JavaScript also takes a lot of resources, so running it on a local server doesn't really help anything, except that it'll still work if my Internet service dies...

Full disclosure, I also tried running [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), so that I can maybe eventually not need to generate the [newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) by digging through Firefox internal databases.  I couldn't figure out the magic words to get NGINX to run it, though, because this project like so many others assumes that I only want to run their code from the root of the server.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The Codeberg-preview plugin that you see used throughout this post needed a couple of minor fixes, such as using the Codeberg icon in context.  You'd think that I would notice these things after months of using the plugin, but maybe it takes time for that to sink in...

Code segments, now, also have an optional style to limit the element's height to scroll them.  When I posted that monster JSON result, last week, it didn't make much sense to let it dwarf the rest of the post, so after the code-block, it has a class attached with `{: .code-scroll }` on the line after.

Finally, to cover a recent post, links to UNESCO now have the United Nations icon indicating the source.

## Earburn

{% codeberg jcolag/earburn %}

I never worked out what Google wanted for my Indie Web-forward browser add-on, why Google's process appears designed to produce ("well-behaved") scams, or why have a unified standard for how add-ons work if every implementation requires wildly varying specifics.  *However*, assuming that I ever get back to this, I wanted to move a copy over.

## G.L.O.B.E

{% codeberg jcolag/g-l-o-b-e %}

Partly because I have started putting games on my home servers, it started to seem like a good idea to collect my puzzle games on Codeberg.  And as usual for these sorts of projects, you can [try it out](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/g-l-o-b-e/) already deployed to Codeberg Pages.

## Iungimoji

{% codeberg jcolag/iungimoji %}

Same deal.  Another old quick puzzle game, this time a memory game with emoji.  I mostly consider it finished, but it seems worth having all the games in the same place.  And you can [try it](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/iungimoji/), though you'll need to mess with the options to set the board size and reload the page.

## INTERN

{% codeberg jcolag/intern %}

I mentioned this project last week, in reference to possibly using the results from so-called embedding (large language) models to create a semantic search across my notes, blog posts, and other material.  And I still might do that, so it seems like a good time to move the project over to where I now expect to find everything.

## Fýlakas Onomáton

{% codeberg jcolag/fylakas-onomaton %}

If you remember this project, you know that the Ruby on Rails service doesn't actually do much, only managing accounts and storing names generating by the client.  It doesn't get much more interesting than verifying a remote device by supplying a code to input.

## Morning Dashboard

{% codeberg jcolag/dash %}

The computer crash from a couple of months ago and the resulting changes in how I manage data and mornings has made my morning dashboard less useful.  But I have started thinking about overhauling it to make it more useful, so maybe moving it over will help that.

## Doritís Onomáton

{% codeberg jcolag/doritis-onomaton %}

Since I moved **Fýlakas Onomáton** over to Codeberg, above, it seemed like a reasonable idea to also move the app, which actually does the work.

If you happen to have read [my novel]({% post_url 2025-09-14-revisit-silver-bat %}) and wondered where I got the decidedly "foreign" names from---including my favorite of the bunch, *Mnoqislasch*, right on the edge of plausible---I used the same algorithm as I implemented in this app.  The app went a step further, though, and creates name in the Arabic, Bengali, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hangul, Hebrew, and Latin alphabets/abjads.

## Next

I imagine that we'll continue to see more of the same, this week, migrations to Codeberg interspersed with an occasional fix to an existing project.
