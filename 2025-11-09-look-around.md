{% cw This post talks frankly, if indirectly, about politics.  If my kicking around terms like "fascism" might agitate you, then you might want to take a breath before reading or consider heading somewhere else, today. %}

Long-time readers have heard me slip this idea into a bunch of posts over the years as an aside, but I see people falling into the trap again.  Therefore, I wanted to formalize what people should know, in hopes of averting the next...whatever we have going on today.

In short?

Dystopia calls on you to look *around* you, not ahead of you.  It warns you about the present, not the future.

![The Sun burning behind deep haze seen through utility poles](/blog/assets/9491659555_6971853c62_o.png "Definitively not the future")

OK, yes, *some* dystopian stories want to warn you about the future.  But they almost all warn you about an *immediate* future to promote some immediate (usually right-wing) political goal.  For example, [**When William Came**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_William_Came) (1913) warns of oppression under German rule to rally support for mandatory military service.  And because of that, you probably don't know about them.  They don't resonate much beyond the immediate warning.

## Background

Other than those propagandist exceptions, these stories mostly warn about current conditions, not fictional possible conditions.  Maybe the first (and most objectionable) example, [**A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sojourn_in_the_City_of_Amalgamation) (1835) didn't really try to imagine the twentieth century in its fearmongering over interracial marriage.  It exaggerates the start of treating Black people like people instead of property, to express the author's disapproval.  Similarly, [**The Republic of the Future**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_the_Future) (1887) doesn't actually imagine a socialist New York in 2050 that shuns anything that makes a person stand out, but instead wants to shame progressive movements of its era.

Further from ugly, regressive politics, the authoritarian oligarchy from [**Caesar's Column**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Column) (1890) doesn't come from some prophecy, not some hypothetical 1988.  The same goes for [**The Iron Heel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Heel) (1908).  When H.G. Wells has futuristic useless elites in the likes of [**The Time Machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine) and [**When the Sleeper Awakes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_The_Sleeper_Wakes), guess who he had in mind.

Far from predicting the incoming political movement of the day, [**Meccania**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccania) (1918) even goes out of its way---under assorted aliases---to indicate that the Nazi-like government takes its cues from the ideas of [Otto von Bismarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck) to block off socialism.  It looks eerie in retrospect because we've forgotten about the conditions in Germany that led to the Nazis, but the pieces sat out in the open for everybody to see.

{% cw #2 --- We'll need to talk about media that doesn't come under Free Culture licenses.  You got plenty of public domain references, though, so quit your complaining... %}

We could go on.  Works you probably have more familiarity with, such as [**Brave New World**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World) (1932), [**It Can't Happen Here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here) (1935), [**Swastika Night**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika_Night) (1937), [**Anthem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_%28novella%29) (1938), and [**Nineteen Eighty-Four**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) (1949) all attack problems (real or imagined) that the authors saw growing in their time.

Yes, that includes [**The Handmaid's Tale**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale)'s (1985) society using a crisis to institute a misogynist theocracy.  It builds on the public backlash to [women's liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_liberation_movement) and[^36HZLG] the rise of the so-called [Moral Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority), drawing on the behavior of the [Puritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans), and blends in a bit of Iran's regressive [Islamic Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran).  [**Parable of the Sower**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_%28novel%29) (1993) comes right out of the mess that the Reagan and (Poppy) Bush administrations left us with, and which Clinton's "New Democrats" mostly wanted to follow.

[^36HZLG]:  I could go on about this at length, honestly.  Switzerland didn't extend [suffrage to women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_Switzerland) until 1971.  Married women have struggled for the right to own property independent of their marriages, with Florida in the United States passing its law in 1970.  The list goes on endlessly, which I point out because you might watch the television adaptation and think that the events look alien, but in 1985, the majority of readers saw much of that treatment of women during their lifetimes.

Does that feel too highbrow for you, with all that dark ink on paper?  OK, it also includes the [**Battlestar Galactica**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29) remake, taking the original premise of refugee survivors of a mass slave revolt (with random helpings of Mormon lore) and combining it with the politics of the (W) Bush administration.  It includes [**Idiocracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy), similarly looking at the Bush administration.  [**The Matrix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) feels like the clearest, for all its science fiction and martial arts trappings[^Iy1QD_], mostly worries that people spend too much time staring at computer screens.

[^Iy1QD_]:  Yes, and gender subtext, buried under the nonsense.

## The Problem

I point this out, because our society has developed a tendency to look back at dystopian works by liberal writers and claim that (a) we have "arrived" at what they wrote about, and that (b) therefore, they *predicted* our current situation(s).  And that not only dismisses some great (and some not-so-great) writers by casting them as accidental prophets, but it also dismisses the causes that they *actually* wrote about.

It doesn't show up in any formal definition, but for many years, I have described dystopian fiction, at its core, as taking the treatment of some oppressed group---or a group that feels oppressed by {% sfx gasp %} other people maybe having their rights supported, as we see in **A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation**---and applying that treatment to the majority, or at least somebody who the audience feels predisposed to identifying with.  Like they say about the future, the *present* doesn't get evenly distributed, either.  [Complementarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism) theocrats, bigotry trying to [make America great {% emoji eyeroll %} again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again), environmental collapse, systemic collapse, militarized policing, lowbrow entertainment, didn't spontaneously appear during your adulthood or even in your lifetime.  They have long histories that the authors who you take as seers already knew about.

## Why Care

And I bring all this up for a couple of reasons.

Most directly and critically, we have a duty to actually know what goes on around us, instead of waiting until it starts affecting people who look like us.  The dystopia serves as an alarm to act on, and those smaller groups deserve the help as much as larger groups do.

In addition, we have a stronger opportunity to *stop* problems when they---pardon the dismissive term---only affect an already disadvantaged group.  It would have taken far less effort to start safeguarding abortion access in the United States, for example, in 1985 when the [Hyde Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) posed the biggest threat, and it had only affected policy for a few years, than it does now that we have the [*Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization*]({% post_url 2022-05-08-alito %}) decision instituting a variety of state-level legal restrictions, in turn forcing abortion clinics to shut down in many states.  And it'll become more difficult still if we wait until the administration begins using the [Comstock Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock_Act_of_1873) or changing FDA policy to (directly or indirectly) ban the use of mifepristone.

And beyond that, if we keep treating these problems as new, instead of deeply embedded in society where we don't usually think to look for them, then we risk whitewashing history, allowing blights to fester and continue to harm our neighbors while we look for foreign influences.  Think about the last few years in the United States as a case study, here.  The same people who talk about the prescience of **The Handmaid's Tale** also characterize what the far-right does as "Russian-style" disinformation, as if [large American companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry_playbook) didn't pioneer the "just asking questions" principles over a century ago.  They talk about parallels to Nazi policy, as if the [Nuremberg Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws) didn't take direct inspiration from [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws), or they call the Florida detention camp our country's local [Auschwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp) as if the United States didn't build [concentration camps for Japanese Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) at around the same time.  They talk about the weaponization of the FBI as foreign as if [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) and *many* other programs of political repression didn't exist.  And they even liken the walking back of women's rights to the [Taliban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban), as if the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) hasn't positioned itself as Christian (Protestant) Nationalist for over a century[^9eqEH1], with even stronger reactionary views on women's rights, as if the country hasn't always had this puritanical streak since literally the Puritans, and as if this country hasn't seen a steady stream of [anti-abortion terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence) for more than thirty years.

[^9eqEH1]:  The original Klan didn't seem to care much about religion, but the version revived through [**The Birth of a Nation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation)'s fan clubs---seriously, they sold robes, like evil Trekkies selling homemade uniforms---centered anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish sentiment, in addition to racism and sexism.  And as long as we need to talk about their embarrassing ties to popular culture, don't forget that the [Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Superman_%28radio_series%29#%22Clan_of_the_Fiery_Cross%22) dealt them a massive blow by airing an approximation of their dirty laundry in the radio show, crushing them until another generation of people got angry at the Civil Rights Movement.

And seeing this as some outside force invading us consistently leaves us open to new *internal* attacks on rights[^SQfBqn].  I have mentioned before how---after centuries of racism and sexism, a prior Trump administration, and their actually publishing Project 2025---a certain kind of person still finds it acceptable to let actions of the current administration take them by surprise.  They have somehow missed the decades of warnings from people at risk *and* the warnings about what this country has in it in the fiction that they value to insist that (as the title said almost a hundred years ago) **It Can't Happen Here**, a book published, I might add, only two years after a [failed conspiracy to overthrow the United States government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot) to create a corporate-friendly oligarchy.  Gosh, how could we ever have seen this coming, with only warnings by already-affected people, an actual guidebook available as a free download, their own statements, a history of exactly these plans, and more...?

[^SQfBqn]:  Case in point, look to the (W) Bush administration, ignoring the growing right-wing terrorism out to destroy, but creating the modern surveillance state and second "the ends justify the means" legal regime, because of one instance of terrorism perpetrated by people who don't resemble the Bush family.

## And Yet

You might, with all that in mind, question why it *feels* like dystopian fiction feels like it uniquely describes our current situation, rather than relics of its time.

I suspect that we all know the answer to that, though:  Terrible people haven't changed in thousands of years.  People often talk about "human nature" not changing, but it does, if slowly, at least on the side of what we might call goodness.

Think about the advances that we've had in how we deal with the world.  Where our ancestors once carried on escalating generational feuds and vendettas, we have seen the shift to a view of justice that aims to balance the scales, to one that tries to prevent additional crimes, to one that tries to heal victim and perpetrator.  Where many of our ancestors saw outsiders and difference as inherently suspect, we have inched towards accepting and then embracing people who look and act nothing like us.  And where our ancestors divided the world into people and things to care about and people and things to reshape for more efficient exploitation, we have slowly expanded the space of ethical responsibility towards who and what we rely on and in participating in that ecosystem.  We have a long way to go in terms of empathy, kindness, respect, and dealing with consequences, but we have gotten much better at it by showing that it works better than the alternatives.

Lousy people, though, don't really innovate.  They still live in a world of terror, where they think that they need to kill and oppress before somebody kills or oppresses them, and they pine for the days when people like us believed it, too.  Check out the worst people in[^g4jbrN] Shakespeare, in [*The Ballad of Mulan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Mulan), the [*Metamorphoses*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses), the [**Panchatantra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchatantra), the [**Tale of Two Brothers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_Two_Brothers), in [**Gilgamesh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh), and in ancient religious texts from around the world, and you see the same collection of jerks under different names and circumstances.  They all delight in avoiding consequences, wielding power over people, exploiting whatever they can control, and crushing hopes, and we can probably imagine that the ancient authors didn't fabricate these personalities from their imaginations.

[^g4jbrN]:  I don't guarantee that actual terrible people show up in all these works, but rather use them as fiction that you've probably heard of that also walks our way back to the earliest known writing.

I mean, the richest man in the world, and one of the most excited about exerting his power over others, gets excited when numbers like 69 and 420 show up and thinks that he lives in a simulation tailored for him.  Do you really think he has some big ethical innovation waiting?  No, he digs racial segregation, treating women like ambulatory wombs, creating plantation-like workspaces where employees never leave, and so forth, like his kind has for millennia.

## The Point

In hopes of maybe avoiding the next attack on civil liberties, and maybe even reversing some of the retreat, like the title of the post says, we need to take dystopia as a reason to look around us---reach out to our friends who the stories might want to warn us to protect---instead of ahead of us to some hypothetical future.  And stop looking for "outside agitators" for our societal problems, because we can't weed them out if we pretend that they don't exist.

In fact, the next time that you check out the hot new dystopia, maybe check in on your friends.  Maybe they need the attention more than your bug-out bag does...
