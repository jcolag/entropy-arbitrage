As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Holiday Interruption

First, though, allow me to slip in an extra quote, due to the occasion.

 > I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery ‚Äî the great sin and shame of America! "I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;" I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.

{% cite Frederick Douglass, What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July %}

In the United States, we don't have nearly as dire a situation as we had when we still had legal slavery---less than a pair of lifetimes ago, keep in mind, so less ancient history than an era that our senior citizens heard first-hand accounts of from their elders---but as I finish up this post, the White House has cowed the Republican Party, forcing it to pass a bill that will begin dismantling the country's social safety net and leaving the infrastructure to rot, while boosting funding to border patrols.  This will not end well, and it deliberately echoes the United States of that era.  In fact, let me jump back in Douglass's speech.

 > At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! Had I the ability, and could reach the nation's ear, I would, today, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.

One element of this situation has not changed:  These spineless traitors to this country's values, whether of the "we'll all die anyway" variety or the "I won't run in 2026," need to go.  Make them own every single death and bankruptcy as a result of their actions.

I don't know, maybe electing the guy with gold toilets, because "at least he talked about egg prices," had some unfortunate effects.  We should consider not doing things like this again.

 > To people of color and immigrants, Mamdani is also one of them. Because of Mamdani‚Äôs interesting background, he brought the limousine liberals together with the aunties from Bangladesh.

Hashtags:  #NYC #USPol #ZohranMamdani

This breaks down the situation far better than any of the many "what a stunning upset" stories, but it still mostly comes down to what I said on Mastodon, that nobody likes the other candidates, and Mamdani has a non-destructive platform.

 > The U.S. ruled the land as an American appendage, a semi-sovereign area that in practice excluded Panamanian citizens from the center of their own country. Until 1979, the Canal Zone had separate infrastructure and governance from Panama, including its own police force, courts, and schools.

I rarely so "go read this one in full," but definitely do that if you typically only skim through here.  It ties a shocking variety of threats together.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114784477923757429)

 > Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race: / Call on the lazy leaden-stepping Hours, / Whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace; / And glut thyself with what thy womb devours, / Which is no more than what is false and vain, / And merely mortal dross.

While the article gestures at it, Doctorow never *quite* comes out and says the important part of this, that surveillance enables manipulation, interceding before somebody can flip the table, and either stifling them or redirecting them.

I suppose the end of a post filled with miserable news doesn't really make the best time to encourage people to feel more hopeful... {% emoji person shrugging %}

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Attoseconds are a natural time frame for atoms and their electrons, says John Gillaspy, a research physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and former program director of atomic, molecular and optical experimental physics at the National Science Foundation.

Not a critical story, but I found it interesting enough to include, especially given the clunky computer situation that I've surely mentioned too often already...
