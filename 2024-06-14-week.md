As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > This means further research is needed to explore the usefulness of this and similar interventions, aimed to abate homophobia and sexism, in different populations and settings.

Hashtags:  #Misogyny #Homophobia

This definitely has potential, though I'd like to see more work in the area.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/112593162847486608)

 > The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Ts«î spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all things.

 > Because public access TV in New York was relatively unregulated, the show‚Äôs hosts could openly discuss sexual health and air segments that would otherwise be censored on broadcast networks.

Hashtags:  #LGBT #TV #PublicAccess

Some of this sounds vaguely familiar, but---probably due to my age and the material's lack of applicability to me---don't remember watching it.  I appreciate that this sort of programming had a home, though, especially in the political mess of the 1980s.

I occasionally reference what little of Rizal's work that I know, but I definitely need to learn more, so I look forward to digging into this.

What a freaky coincidence that a rabidly anti-union organization has instituted a system that minimizes the chances that its workers might talk to each other, right...?

Yes, on top of "greedflation," we have an industry of consultants who work in the (definitely illegal) field of price-fixing...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Among those still in the land of the living, Thomas' haul is over 20 times greater than that of runner-up Samuel Alito. Expect Alito to have a chat with Trump‚Äôs collection of billionaire donors about that sad imbalance.

It worries me that, for the last few years, people have talked about how close we've gotten to the court losing its legitimacy...but the scandals keep coming, and we seem to talk about that *less*, and not actually treating it as illegitimate.
