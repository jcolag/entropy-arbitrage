This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads **2048**, **Enkidu**, and **Plastic**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **2048**, **Enkidu**, and **Plastic**
 * Location:  <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Libre_art_theatre_plays>
 * Released:  2017 -- 2018

 * Medium:  Plays
 * Length:  Approximately twenty-six hundred words across three works, about half in Hungarian
 * Content Advisories:  Some religious themes, sexism, necrophilia, references to sex

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Libre Art Plays

I can't find any formal statement on these plays, only recently finding them squirreled away on Wikimedia Commons, but I get the sense that they probably lean more towards the post-modern than "characters have dramatic conversations on stage" side of things.

Note that, not having ever learned Hungarian[^1], I read **2048** in shoddy translation.  Based on some of the diction, I suspect that the English texts also got that way through translation.

[^1]:  OK, technically, sure, in the late '90s, I did try to learn some core Hungarian in hopes of making my then-colleagues from a Hungarian office feel welcome when they visited us...exactly like a normal human would do.  They responded to my attempt at a hearty (I believe) *Üdvözöljük* with "not bad, considering that we have teenagers back home who still can't pronounce their own names."

It appears that Szervác has worked on more than these plays, most notably a "child opera" called *Rozalovag bozz* that has its ten-minute overture published, possibly the circus theater piece *Hottentotta*, and other music.  I chose to focus on the parts that we could read, especially since I don't think that we've talked about any plays, yet[^2].

[^2]:  [**Occupy This Novel!**]({% post_url 2021-10-23-occupy1 %}) has a companion-or-sequel play **Occupy This Theater!**, and both [**Orang-U**]({% post_url 2020-05-09-orangu %}) and [**Valkaama**]({% post_url 2021-03-27-valkaama %}) had screenplays accessible, but we didn't directly discuss any of them, and only the first would actually qualify as a play in the sense that we generally mean it of a dialogue-focused work designed for presentation on stage.

## What Works Well?

Partly due to the nature of the different formats, the author's presumed humor, and the translation, we get some delightfully jarring lines.

 > Gilgamesh, my bro, shine your beautiful face...

Well, *I* like it, at least.

Maybe related, while I don't particularly *enjoy* it, given the strangely dark turns, these plays might represent the most overtly and self-consciously "artistic" projects that I've seen in Free Culture.  Say what you (or I) will about the ultimate value of schematic stories about the relationship between violence and authority or the others, but the plays seem deliberately constructed to provoke the audience into thinking about the topics first and telling a story second.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I don't know if the format really works for the content.  In a medium designed for dialogue---the scripts---**Enkidu** has less than ten short lines of spoken dialogue.  And it buries those lines in quick descriptions of what I assume should serve as longer physical scenes to help support the point.  We might also have translation problems, here, since the play seems to fall apart in the fourth scene, with the descriptions...less than fully coherent, let's say.  Likewise, **Plastic** tells its story through dance, but we don't get any impression *of* the dance, only the story that they want the dance to tell.

## Opportunities

It looks like Szervác has a web presence, let alone some sort of community-building process.

## What's Adaptable?

**2048** introduces a company named ICT, where employees---programmers among them---live on-site, though robots have begun taking over some factory jobs.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll listen to Botfly Mother's **floodlight up. liquid god**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the poems?
