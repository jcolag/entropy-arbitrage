summary: Toots for the Week of February 20th, 2023

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

As of this week, I have started trying to remember to use hashtags on toots, because Mastodon doesn't have great way of searching for keywords.  I don't think that it makes sense to include those hashtags in these blog posts---and the syntax looks a lot like Markdown headings, which might make life difficult---but I'll reconsider that, going forward.  Feel free to chime in, if you have an opinion either way.

## 5:13 PM -- Sat 18 February 2023

 > Not great news:

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/109888039990597371) [Former President Jimmy Carter Enters Home Hospice Care](https://www.voanews.com/a/former-president-jimmy-carter-enters-home-hospice-care-/6969019.html) from Voice of America

 > In recent years, the Georgia native suffered from several health issues, including an aggressive form of melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.

It amazes me how clearly you can see Carter's administration as the test bed of modern Republican politics.  Two Republican administrations handed him a country almost in tatters.  The party opposed and outright sabotaged his actions, up to and including (illegally) delaying the Iranian hostage release, and then insisted on putting the responsibility for the *original* problems on him.

Instead of screaming about it and fighting to get back in office, Carter turned his efforts to charitable work, only speaking out when he felt it absolutely necessary.  When he passes---and I hope that doesn't come soon---history will remember him far more fondly than the overwhelming majority of his peers in the Oval Office.

As such, I made an exception to my usual posting habits and sent out the article on a Saturday evening.

I went through a ragtime and Scott Joplin phase, many years ago, and I find it telling about how the music industry---and society in general---works, that I've never heard of **Treemonisha**.  I'll have to hunt down a presentation of it.

Honestly, as outlets cover the Dominion lawsuit, it feels increasingly bizarre that nobody seems to remember these straightforward and fairly widely reported facts.  And that leads to people on social media giving Fox far too much credit, as they declare that the company "betrayed" its viewers.  They didn't sell out or find themselves exposed as hypocrites.  They built the company on betrayal, choosing a path that makes the world a worse place, and built in a source of funding independent of ratings.

 > They build up to phrases like ‚ÄúJesus was a refugee‚Äù, ‚ÄúJesus was born to a teen mom‚Äù, ‚ÄúJesus was wrongly judged‚Äù and ‚ÄúJesus was cancelled too‚Äù (a phrase that, especially in the US, indicates a barely coded right-wing political agenda).

I find it odd how little attention the media has given this campaign, even if they somehow feel the need to support it.  I feel like, usually, any Super Bowl ad (especially if the campaign already existed) not representing a product gets analysis from every angle, but nobody seems to have engaged with anything, this year.  Maybe people have finally realized that it helps support the ecosystem of watching a sport that brutalizes mostly Black bodies and supports militarism "for the ads," and that engaging with ads literally keeps the enterprise afloat.  But I'd guess something more like a fear of appearing to criticize Christianity.

 > In the apocalyptic vision, John describes a war in heaven. You have only to strip that vision of its gorgeous Oriental drapery, divest it of its shining and celestial ornaments, clothe it in the simple and familiar language of common sense, and you will have before you the eternal conflict between right and wrong, good and evil, liberty and slavery, truth and falsehood, the glorious light of love, and the appalling darkness of human selfishness and sin.

They blame this on COVID-19, of course, but you might notice that this period coincides with right-wing groups ratcheting up their attacks on public education.  When you have politicians threatening to jail teachers for making books available or telling the truth about the world, you'll find kids struggling.

Keep in mind that SNAP recipients need to go far out of their way to prove that they can't survive without the help, by the way.  Not giving them control over that help makes this even crueler.

What did I say about making this as cruel as possible?  We managed to fix a significant part of a problem, so we'll let the solution expire *while* companies take every excuse that they can find to jack up prices.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > If masses of people blocking Musk cause his engagement to drop again, those devs will surely just amp up that boost. But at the very least, if they have to do it, it means we‚Äôve made Musk bitterly unhappy once again.

While I never condone harassment of any sort, do legitimate uses of social media exist that are *not* making powerful people uncomfortable with their terrible decisions...?
