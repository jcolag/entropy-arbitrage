## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Time's Arrow, part 2

I vaguely remember this season of the show blindsiding me, figuring that nobody would *ever* renew it after the bland cliffhanger from part-one.

 > **REPORTER**: Yes, sir. And will this be a sequel to Connecticut Yankee, Mister Twain?

[**A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court) tells the story of Hank Morgan, who wakes up in the middle of [**Le Morte d'Arthur**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur), and pushes to industrialize and militarize the kingdom to not-so-great ends.

A couple of years after this episode, Whoopi Goldberg would play *Vivien* Morgan in the loose TV-movie adaptation [**A Knight in Camelot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Knight_in_Camelot).

 > **RIKER**: The coroner said this is where they kept all the cholera victims.

Seeing him in his disguise, Riker fits surprisingly well with the whole "protect capital from people" core of police departments...

 > **CRUSHER**: It doesn't make sense that so many people are dying of cholera. It just isn't that virulent. Will, this is strange.

This framing feels vaguely offensive, and I don't know whether to blame the writers overall or the characters.

The episode takes place in 1893, right?  That drops it near the end of the [fifth cholera pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1881%E2%80%931896_cholera_pandemic), and the fifth major outbreak of the century.  And while nearly a million people died over the course of the spread, strict quarantine measures severely limited outbreaks in the United States.  Six years later, the [next pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899%E2%80%931923_cholera_pandemic) would repeat most of that.  After that?  Oh, the [seventh pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_cholera_pandemic) started in 1961 and continues to today, with well over a million people dying so far.  If I read the reports correctly, when this episode aired, around ten thousand people had recently died of a cholera surge in Peru.

At the time of the episode, the mortality rate had started to drop due to advances in treatment, but you know as well as I do that treatment has a tendency to cost money and not get distributed equitably.

Anyway, back to the point:  Cholera seems *pretty virulent* to me.  They focus on what sounds like a fictional outbreak that erases the far worse outbreaks around the world.  And they dismiss the danger on the heels of thousands of deaths of such an outbreak in our world.

 > **PICARD**: The play? **A Midsummer Night's Dream**. We have performed in London, Paris, Milan. *Milan*, to sold out houses. I assure you, you will have the rent, in full, with a bonus.

When I think of cover stories that imply that I'll soon have plenty of money, I can't say that itinerant actors touring with [the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream) where the fairy queen has sex with a donkey named Nick Bottom[^1] doesn't exactly rank in my top-ten.

[^1]:  Other things happen, too, but we both know that you don't care after hearing that.

 > **BELLBOY**: Don't forget. The name's London. Jack London.

You might actually have a better chance of knowing [Jack London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London)'s name than Clemens/Twain's, having made an international name for himself in journalism and fiction, including a fair amount of science fiction.  Take care while reading his work, though, because while you'll probably cheer on his pro-union, anti-capitalist politics, he had the full panoply of "oh, please stop talking" views on race and eugenics that the worst people of his era had to offer...though he also slipped in occasional short stories that seem to want to at least camouflage that reputation.

It strikes me as somewhat ironic---or maybe poorly researched---that this story has Clemens worry about the Asian-coded foreigner conspiring with a Black woman, when Clemens (rightly) described abolishing slavery as liberating white people as well as Black, whereas London spent a lot of time railing against Asian immigration and wishing that a "great white hope" would defeat [Jack Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_%28boxer%29) after he became the heavyweight champion to mitigate the damage he perceived done to boxing by a Black person winning.

While I have that thought, I'll also expand on my comment hidden in the image caption [last time]({% post_url 2024-11-07-time-s-arrow-1 %}), that Clemens also became friends with [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla).  And while the popular Tesla biographies and fictionalized appearances wouldn't start getting much attention until another couple of years after the episode aired, and I don't think that they'd have any reason to place him in San Francisco for his story, it seems strange in retrospect that they didn't connect Clemens with Data *through* their shared interest in weird technology.

Actually, with that weirdness and the cholera nonsense above, I wonder if somebody hastily rewrote this episode from something that actually makes sense, for some external reason.  I say that, because while San Francisco didn't have an 1893 cholera outbreak that I can find, it *did* have a [1900 plague outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900%E2%80%931904_San_Francisco_plague) as part of the broader [third plague pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_plague_pandemic) that lasted for about a century and ultimately killed millions.  And the virulence of bubonic plague inversely tracks sanitation and pest control, which would better fit with Crusher's line.  And now we have a series of historical deviations from what could've made the script work more smoothly, which seems suspicious, if not particularly important to the post...

 > **RIKER**: I just want you to know that I have the utmost respect for the law.

I can't help drawing a parallel between Riker's actions, here, and the (predominantly white) folks who "back the blue" when accusations of police violence come up, but want the police department destroyed when they get pulled over for speeding (or asked to stop rioting).

By the way, you might recognize the cop as [William Boyett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Boyett), possibly an instance of mild stunt-casting, given his long history of playing law enforcement types, from nameless detectives in his early appearances to the cop in [*The Big Goodbye*]({% post_url 2022-08-04-big-goodbye %}) and the judge in the contemporary-to-this-episode **Newsies** starring Christian Bale, which they soon moved to Broadway.

 > **DATA**: I suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion.

Can he not talk and drive at the same time?  It seems like he had time to deliver this dismissive line...

 > **DATA**: I have located that cavern.

Wait, what?  They already knew *where* to find the cavern.  They visited the cavern early last episode.  Maybe they didn't know that accessing the cavern would involve difficulties...and still don't know that, since Data didn't bother to tell them that part.  But they should have no worries about the location.

 > **CRUSHER**: Over hill, over dale, thorough bush, thorough brier...

This exposes the shoddy nature of their cover story, with Carmichael walking in *exactly* at the start of Act II, Scene I...

 > **CLEMENS**: Madam, I'd be delighted. So, this is a spaceship? You ever run into Halley's comet?

Clemens had something of an obsession with [Halley's comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet), born two weeks after its 1835 perihelion and convinced---correctly, as it would turn out---that he'd die shortly after the 1910 perihelion.  Largely because of that bit of storytelling, the comet (and Twain's works) stayed in the news and other media around the 1986 perihelion, then when the comet released an enormous amount of dust in 1990--1991, the latter probably not too long before when they wrote the episode.

Anyway, this shows a serious lack of imagination on the fictionalized writer's part, if that seems like the most exotic thing that he can think of in the universe.

 > **TROI**: He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered. We live in a peaceful Federation with most of them. The people you see are here by choice.

I have to laugh at how the episode has Clemens specifically point out---immediately before this line---that imperial powers say things exactly like this all the time, but then expects us to accept it because Troi asserted the same thing.

 > **TROI**: Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago, and a lot of other things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty.

I don't know how anybody who has watched this show can agree with Troi's addendum, here.  In [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %}), for example, Wesley's friend Jake tried to flee the Federation due to the pressure he felt failing to get into Starfleet Academy and, when that went badly, wanted them to let him die.  Does that sound like something *other* than hopelessness and despair?  What about [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), when most of the crew supported a colleague's suicide, except on vague moralizing grounds of finding the act itself offensive?  And do you want to tell me that Picard pushing around the aliens in [*The Ensigns of Command*]({% post_url 2023-05-11-ensigns-command %}) didn't count as cruelty, or maybe his attempt to commit genocide in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %})?  What about Riker openly harassing a new colleague in [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %}) and the character's other appearances?  Or maybe we could marvel at the alleged compassion involved in covering up manslaughter and threatening whistle-blowers in [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}).

And if Troi doesn't see these incidents, even when they happen in front of her, can we trust that they don't need to worry about poverty?  Or, maybe more importantly given a lot of current political fights, can we trust that Earth eliminated poverty in a humane way?  You don't need to search long, after all, to find a wealthy and influential person echoing Ebenezer Scrooge's line that people who can't afford rent and won't go to a debtor's prison should die "and decrease the surplus population."

Likewise, with this sloppy oversight, can we trust her when she tells Clemens that the Federation has no imperial or exploitative aspects?  We might consider the so-called [poverty draft](https://nnomy.org/index.php/en/poverty-draft.html), the idea that volunteer militaries often present themselves to underprivileged people as a quick path out of poverty or at least as a substitute for education, with multiple campaigns (the advertising sort, as well as recruitment tours) making that fairly explicit.  We do know, from episodes like *Coming of Age* and [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}), that people want children to see Starfleet service as an optimal career.  And if they eliminated poverty "on Earth"---note that Troi almost goes out of her way to avoid talking about anyplace else---that might call into question the "choice" exerted by exactly those officers that Clemens saw as subjects.

## Conclusions

We get a lot of (apocryphal) history and some new Shakespeare, but the episode mostly concerns itself with its plot.

### The Bad

We see Riker in particular drawn to police work, until it inconveniences him.  They also waste time with the shadow-play of explaining why they don't have time to briefly say things.

The episode seems to strongly undermine Troi's assertions of the wonders of their future, claiming to have erased problems that we've seen often, while dismissing accusations in exactly the way that the script tells us that empires do.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next week, when we pretend to learn things about fictional technology, while dealing with guest star foibles, in *Realm of Fear*.
