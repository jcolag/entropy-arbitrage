I couldn't find anything better, today, than the eve of the two hundred tenth anniversary of the signing of the [Treaty of Ghent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent), which put an end to the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812) between the United Kingdom and the United States.

On that brief note---since I don't want to write a thousand words on Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa all coming up later this week---on to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The remnants of styling and highlighting changes that I put in for [last week]({% post_url 2024-12-16-reconciliation %}) should have now stabilized.  Content warning messages no longer separate from the warning notice itself, tables of contents now float on top of the page when you have them open---figuring that opening the table means that you want to *read* it---and the highlighting code now uses real words that make sense instead of treating the variable names as purely technical things.

More importantly, the pages currently hide all aspects of the feature---using the `in-progress` class, if you desperately want incomplete code running on your browser, complete with the shoddiest user interface imaginable---but the blog now provisionally has a feature to quickly "save" a post for later.  It uses the [browser's local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), meaning that it doesn't need to worry about privacy or any related issues.  And in turn, this ties into my change a while back hiding features on browsers with no JavaScript available, since this can't work without scripting.

Why create this at all?  I might have the wrong audience in mind, but when writing my five-year retrospective, I [confessed]({% post_url 2024-12-08-five-years %}#:~:text=commenting has felt more like a chore) my own difficulties leaving comments on other people's blogs.

 > ...commenting has felt more like a chore, because I need to click out of my reader to get to the comment area, maybe let the page sit for a few hours if I'd rather not send an immediate reply for various reasons, and I end up not commenting on other people's work nearly as often as I probably should...

This got me thinking that I might leave more comments if I could remember to come back to the post without needing to leave it open in a browser tab or have my RSS feed reader save it someplace that I'll never remember to check.  And if such a feature might help me to comment more often, then it could also help other readers.  It wouldn't take much code, either, so it seemed worth the experiment.

Granted, I don't actually expect the experiment to improve things for a fairly natural reason:  Frequent readers probably need the most prodding to leave comments, because people who land on a post from the middle of nowhere presumably make a snap decision on whether they want to get involved, and either do so or move on when they've gotten as much out of the post as they care to.  However, those frequent readers probably read the post through the RSS feed, where they won't see the feature at all.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Ham Newsletter**](https://github.com/jcolag/ham-newsletter) and [**Socialite**](https://github.com/jcolag/socialite).

## Next

I need to finish the post-saving feature for the blog, this week---the code doesn't remove posts from the saved list, yet, and doesn't handle any data errors---and work out a better user interface than a (currently hidden, remember) hyperlink that doesn't go anywhere at the top of every post.
