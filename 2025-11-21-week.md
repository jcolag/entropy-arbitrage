As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Supporting these children is important. Students who wrestle with reading are more likely to later experience anxiety and depression. Adults with reading difficulties are also more likely to be incarcerated and unemployed.

Seems like one heck of a coincidence, right?  The United States bans slave labor, *except* as criminal incarceration.  And so we incarcerate more offenders than any other government in history.  Then, we have conditions that lead children to grow up groomed for incarceration, and wouldn't you know it, they happen to look like the people who we can't keep as slaves.

And the people who advocate for those policies also want us to "get over" slavery... {% emoji angry face %}

 > By grappling with stereotypes like the “sex object” and offering a broad analysis of how we’re all objectified by capitalism, which sees our bodies and labor as mere commodities, Wages for Housework laid the ideological foundations for organizations like the English Collective of Prostitutes, an affiliated but autonomous group.

And I assume that this means that we can expect to see a "sudden" rise in breast cancer in a few years, as mass deportations mean that people who the media might actually care about need to take those jobs.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Where you live affects how long you’ll live](https://www.futurity.org/where-you-live-affects-how-long-youll-live-3304922/) from Futurity

 > “We expected disparities,” says the study’s lead author Omar Karlsson, a scholar with the Center for Policy Impact in Global Health at the Duke Global Health Institute. “What was surprising was just how extremely uneven mortality decline has been across the world.”

A second quote for this one, actually.

 > How did China do it? China’s success came from sweeping public health campaigns, nearly universal access to primary care, [pollution reduction](https://www.futurity.org/china-air-pollution-1706702/), and major gains in education and poverty alleviation.

Coming from the United States, this doesn't surprise me, because we have decades of housing segregation that keep certain classes of people away from public services and also become a dumping ground for anything that the powerful don't want to look at, such as power plants.

{% cw US Thanksgiving %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How the Plymouth Pilgrims took over Thanksgiving – and who history left behind](https://theconversation.com/how-the-plymouth-pilgrims-took-over-thanksgiving-and-who-history-left-behind-267944) from The Conversation

 > The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s [1863 proclamation](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/01733.05p658.pdf), published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s [illustrated follow-up](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/01733.05p776-777.pdf). The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, [many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-thanksgiving-south-history-20171223-story.html), which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

I don't like the frame of "other people have given thanks *and* held harvest festivals," because I don't think that anybody has ever found that unclear, but I still recommend the article for the traditions that actually stay on-topic.
