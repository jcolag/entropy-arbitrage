As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Even new ‚Äúluxury‚Äù apartments or condos can reduce competition for older units, taking some pressure off rents for people with lower incomes.

I always feel torn, because I can't imagine not living in suburbs, because I value the quiet and privacy.  However, they do tend towards the destructive.

This feels like it should interest at least some readers, though I don't have much to say about it.

I keep telling you all that the authoritarian emperors have no clothes.  They'll go out of their way to hurt as many people as they can as they implode, but in the end, authoritarians *only* have violence to maintain their rule, and once the population stands up to them despite the threats of violence, they have nothing left of use.

I've probably written about this before, and always mean to write a full blog post on it with maybe some actual research beyond my memories, but this reminds me a lot of the world of New Age bookshops in the 1980s and 1990s.  Conversations---which I witnessed, because I had a parent who frequented the places---would start with some unscientific but largely harmless sales pitch about using crystals and meditation to heal, but would quickly get into cultural misappropriation and a rogue government keeping critical secrets from Americans, by the time that you got to the UFO side of the shop, overt racism where "good" aliens look like giant Swedes and the bad aliens happen to also figure into anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.  Along the way, you get magic (or aliens) helping non-white folks stack blocks.

I sometimes wonder how much of an effect this culture had on politics, because it often *feels* like how we all live our lives, these days.  Every oddball idea bounces down a pachinko board until it either bounces completely out of the machine or lands in a right-wing rat's nest...

I admittedly have never heard of RCR, but it still saddens me when these sorts of initiatives fail for such pointless reasons.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Cultivating the Next Crop of America‚Äôs Farmers](https://otherwords.org/cultivating-the-next-crop-of-americas-farmers/) from OtherWords

 > The federal government spends billions every year on farm subsidies, but most of the money goes to the largest and wealthiest operators. And because of systemic racism, Black and Indigenous farmers have faced particular difficulty in accessing these funds.

We absolutely need to fix this, if only because the last few years have taught us all that we shouldn't trust large companies to act in anybody's best interests.  They all stand *one* temper tantrum away from a billionaire buying them out and decide to charge for continuing the parts of the business that make the company successful.

 > ‚ÄúTwitter has two important advantages over other social media platforms. The first privilege is the freedom of speech. The second privilege is the public nature & credibility of Twitter. Twitter doesn't have an intolerant policy like Meta. Other platforms cannot replace it.‚Äù

Does this surprise anybody?  The religion of right-wing movements affects almost nothing about their behavior:  They all love Twitter, because they have a reputation---enhanced under new management---of not policing authoritarians and their lackeys.
