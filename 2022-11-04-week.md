**Public Service Announcement**:  For those of us in the United States, Election Day comes on Tuesday.  Early voting turnout has grown over past years, suggesting that polling places will have their hands full on the actual day.  If you haven't already voted, make a plan.  Specifically, if your state has early voting, take care of it this weekend; you won't regret taking advantage of the process.  If you can't do that, bring food, water, and something to occupy your time on Tuesday, just in case. üá∫üá∏

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The findings also indicate that the expiration of the CTC exacerbates racial and economic inequities in consistent access to adequate and healthy food.

I admittedly love the shocked and amazed reactions to this story as it progresses, as if something feels counter-intuitive about the premise that giving poor people money makes them less poor, and stopping before they can build wealth makes them poor again.  I also find it a massive shame that we pretend that we need to experiment with millions of lives to figure this out, but I'll grudgingly accept that if we can finally implement systems that bring people out of poverty instead of punishing them for it in hopes that it convinces them to fix the economy themselves.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1587429499582431237) [One of the last Ladino language speakers in Bosnia, Moris Albahari, passed away](https://globalvoices.org/2022/10/25/one-of-the-last-ladino-language-speakers-in-bosnia-moris-albahari-passed-away/) from Global Voices

 > Bosnian media also described him as ‚Äúthe guardian of the Haggidah,‚Äù a famous medieval collection of Jewish regulations and traditions.

Embarrassingly, I keep forgetting that Europe has endangered languages of its own, especially among Jewish communities.

 > Building two more developments increased prices by a total of 3 additional percentage points, on average, within a quarter-mile and 4 percentage points over the next quarter-mile.

Again, we see that government spending on poor people improves the economy.  Government spending on rich people makes the economy worse.  Maybe economy-oriented voters should keep that in mind, rather than insisting on abstract theories with no empirical evidence...

 > They're also big donors to the American Principles Project and its anti "transgender ideology" attack ads, which also target abortion and "critical race theory."

Above, I mention that spending money on poor people works better than spending money on rich people.  Here, we learn that spending money on rich people funds fascist insurrections.  It feels like we could build useful policies around this...

 > What about the fact that states that voted for Trump in 2020 had murder rates 40 percent higher than those won by Joe Biden?

For decades, Republicans have used "crime" as a dog-whistle for the existence of non-white people.  They never care about the actual crime rate, and in fact, their policies routinely *increase* crime, by depriving people of options and collecting them where they can learn from career criminals.

I claim that they do this intentionally.  Their oppressive policies only make sense if we imagine mobs of people wishing us harm, so they create the mirage of it, and then support policies that make that image true.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Neo-Nazis, Antisemites, and the N-Word: Twitter Just Hours Under Elon Musk](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgpkqb/elon-musk-twitter-neo-nazis) from VICE News

 > Many of the earlier tweets have been deleted and some of the accounts suspended, indicating that Twitter‚Äôs moderation policies remain in place.

I see two takeaways, here.

First, regardless of the reality or his desires, Musk's mob of fans think of him as racist and fascist.

Second, for at least the immediate future, Musk will need to play nice.  He'll probably take some petty actions that'll backfire, but if he doesn't like the assessment of his fans or the kind of scrutiny that tends to bring, he'll need to watch his step.

Also, we shouldn't pretend that Jack Dorsey had the good of humanity in mind, when he ran things.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The White House‚Äôs ‚ÄòAI Bill of Rights‚Äô outlines five principles to make artificial intelligence safer, more transparent and less discriminatory](https://theconversation.com/the-white-houses-ai-bill-of-rights-outlines-five-principles-to-make-artificial-intelligence-safer-more-transparent-and-less-discriminatory-192003) from The Conversation

 > The first two principles aim to address the safety and effectiveness of AI systems as well as the major risk of AI furthering discrimination.

I don't know if this will do what it needs to do, but we certainly need *something* in this space setting limits on these processes.
