As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > That is, a trade deficit can only arise if foreigners invest more in the U.S. than Americans invest abroad. In other words, a country can only have a trade deficit if it also has an equally sized investment surplus.

Hashtags:  #Economics #Tariffs

I not only agree with this, but wish that I had said what I thought everybody knew, when Trump started floating tariffs again.  See also [America, the Isolated](https://www.theindex.media/america-the-isolated/) for something more like the actual goal, or rather one of two goals.

The first goal recognizes that we (people) stand---pardon borrowing a failed slogan, here---stronger together, so modern reactionaries seeks to atomize us.  Remove us from the global stage.  Create "great firewalls" to fragment the Internet.  Send important issues "back to" local governments.

The second goal showed itself during the week.  When you use tariffs as financial policy instead of political policy, then countries and companies pour money into lobbying firms to line up begging for exemptions, so that they can move merchandise more cheaply.  In other words, it enables a wide channel for corruption, especially when everybody needs to lobby the same person.

I think that, deep down, we all already knew this.  At least since the women's suffrage movement, the right has searched for or fabricated the evidence of feminists' alleged ugliness.  It especially becomes apparent when a woman *reveals* progressive views, and terrible people need to contort themselves to explain why they lusted after her last week, but now find her repulsive, without saying anything that exposes the misogyny.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Strikes

It actually bothers me that, even in a post dedicated to the history of how people walking away from their lives affects government, we've forgotten the fact that the largest general "social strike" occurred in our lifetimes.  I've said it before, probably many times, but in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overwhelming majority of us stayed home.  We didn't work.  We limited our purchases to absolute necessities.

Sure, we did it out of immediate fear for our lives, but we did it.  And what happened?  If you'll cast your memory back five years, you might remember that---in the United States---the Trump administration, the Republican-led House of Representatives, the Republican-led Senate, and the Republican-majority Supreme Court, all people who insist that the United States government should never, ever help Americans or anybody else, poured money into developing a vaccine and started sending people money to tide us over.  It *terrified* them that we didn't spend money on their cronies' companies.

And what happened when we started going back out?  They tried to claw back every penny that they sent out, discredited the vaccines that they supported, and otherwise rushed to get back to a normal state where we don't have any power over them.

 > When Milei brags about conducting ‚Äúthe largest fiscal adjustment in human history,‚Äù he is doing more than announcing policy. He is advertising a new Darwinist political morality: pain is proof of courage, collapse is a prerequisite for a messianic rebirth, and those left behind are simply unfit for the times.

Hashtags:  #Fascism #Violence

While I don't see it as *necessarily* violent, in a hypothetical sense, they do all see it as important that we think of them as masculine and powerful, and they only understand either of those in terms of violence.  They see protecting people as a weakness, even though it generally takes almost no effort to get them to back down on their agendas.

 > Beyond carrying books and DVDs, libraries provide essential programs and resources to the people they serve. While every library is unique, offerings include: helping students with homework or research, reading and literacy programming for children of all ages, as well as English language, GED, and citizenship classes.

Hashtags:  #PublicLibraries

I don't think that it exaggerates much to say that many people might not have made it through childhood as well as they did without their local libraries.  In my case, decades out of date, they provided books that we wouldn't have seen otherwise.  They provided the first spaces where many of us had much independence.  Non-school clubs met there, providing some of the first social relationships not based on spending every day together.  And while they sometimes try to guide, the generally doesn't judge, no matter how bizarre a request.

These days, they also provide access to online services, access to gadgets like 3D printers, and more, on top of everything in the list above.  It shouldn't really surprise anybody that Republicans hate the idea, since everything about that opposes everything that they stand for...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Hip-hop has also cataloged tragedies such as the 1921 Tulsa race massacre ‚Äì a two-day assault by white mobs on their Black neighbors ‚Äì and the 1995 Million Man March, a large gathering of Black men in Washington, D.C.

I wish that the article spent more time on what the title promises, instead of the author's (completely legitimate, but less interesting) fight to submit a rap album as a PhD thesis.  However, it does eventually make its point.

 > Antitrust systematically attacks the sky-high monopoly rents extracted by the largest corporations and redistributes them to working people and small businesses, which, for the most part, are not listed on stock exchanges or traded over the counter.

As John Sherman---brother to the famous United States General William Tecumseh Sherman---put it, "If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.  If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade."
