* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

Like [last week]({% post_url 2025-12-28-review-2025 %}) followed my now-tradition of looking back on the year, on this blog, I try to pick the first Sunday of the year to look forward at the upcoming year.

![A comic-like scene of a child in winter gear with a stuffed bunny sitting next to the words Happy New Year](/blog/assets/55010859329_47ed2812f6_o.png "Once again, I tried to force a nature scene that blended 2026 into it, and realized that it would never work")

Therefore, have a happy new year!  {% emoji party popper %}  As usual, if you use a different calendar, enjoy however you plan to mark the day, too.

## Media

In early years of the blog, I took some space in the new year posts to write about the media that I particularly enjoyed during the past year, as well as what I looked forward to seeing in the next.  Since I now keep a running list of shows and movies that I watch in the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), complete with opinions, it no longer seems useful to have a reduced version of that, here.  That seems especially true, since it never felt right to write extensively here about content that I wouldn't call Free Culture, at least apart from the [*Star Trek*](/blog/tag/star-trek) posts, a project that does have specific analytical goals.

And also, once again, I increasingly find myself looking forward to *less* media, at least television and film.  I always feel out of step with the big-studio target audiences, especially as they start to act like they have a captive audience.  I don't oppose enjoying any of these things on any principle[^kvGYfI], but when the assembly line of content builds around having a pipe directly into your living room and only needs to care that some number of people add or renew their subscriptions, then they don't really make much for me.

[^kvGYfI]:  It seems worth noting that, through the 2025 newsletter issues, out of four hundred fifty bits of media that I "consumed" for non-blog reasons, I referred to loving or feeling delighted by twenty-two works, in case you think that I deliberately avoid liking things.  How many of them come out of a major media outlet?  Seven, if we include three BBC productions and two shows (not from the BBC) that filmed decades ago as major, so really only two in the conventional American sense.  Similarly, I got at fifteen of them---one book, three films, five comics, and six television shows---through library services, two from PBS, two from ad-supported streaming, one from DVD, one from the broader Internet, and only one from a commercial streaming service.  Think about the odds on that.  I loved less than five percent of works, and of those, only have a major studio to thank for about thirteen percent.  Year after year, I see a similar breakdown.  When I say that I don't fit the target audience, I mean that maybe half a percent of my media enjoyment comes from a major studio or publisher.

### Public Domain Day

At least bordering on Free Culture, at the stroke of midnight this past Thursday, all American media---other than music recordings, which we handle slightly differently, a vast improvement from when we didn't handle it at all---from 1930 lost copyright protection in the United States, placing it in the public domain, at least assuming that the creators published it here at that time.  I have some examples that I find interesting, on at least some level.

![Georgia O'Keeffe's painting Red Rust Hills](/blog/assets/rust-red-hills-georgia-okeeffe.png "I could've gone with American Gothic like literally everybody else, but how often do I get to gesture emphatically at Georgia O'Keeffe...?")

I should note, as always, that I take a stricter approach to my assessments than the various anti-copyright people do.  As I [outlined the treaties and laws]({% post_url 2025-01-05-hny2025 %}#might-as-well-digress) last year, my [reading of United States copyright law]({% post_url 2020-07-19-pdomain %}) says that American copyrights expire based on when the creator(s) published their works *in the United States*, not published in general.  Maybe I overlooked a law that says that we treat foreign works as having less copyright protection than they would if we respected their home country's copyright, or maybe you see it as worth risking a broader interpretation, but I see it as more sensible to read the laws as narrowly as possible, even though more influential and famous people than me will tell you that you should totally go write some [Rymy-Eetu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rymy-Eetu) fan fiction[^op73Z9].

[^op73Z9]:  You'll notice that they never do it themselves, though.  They say "let's you and him fight," but haven't published new editions of Tintin, new translations of Freud, [**The Twelve Chairs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Chairs) sequels, or adaptations of or much of anything else that would show confidence in their assessments.  And while I realize that legal analysts don't necessarily also have an interest in publishing, but you see this throughout copyright debates, where somebody can talk about "orphan works" or "character copyrights" or even occasionally [adverse possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession) of copyright, and people take it seriously when they tell us to go try it.  People do that with all sorts of law, but usually only a tiny minority of people believe (one of my favorite goofy examples) that you can issue yourself credit to pay for things and claim it on your taxes to get reimbursed from a secret United Nations account; most people roll their eyes and move on, rather than repeating it as a definitely true thing to try.

#### Novels and Other Prose {% emoji books %}

The books seem more exciting than we've seen in previous years, at least to me.  We see more important works by women and Black people---the latter, with many works as part of the [Harlem Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance)---than we have seen previously, even if nothing else.

- Margaret Ayer Barnes, [**Years of Grace**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Grace)
- Pearl S. Buck, [**East Wind: West Wind**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Wind:_West_Wind)
- Hart Crane, [**The Bridge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_%28long_poem%29)
- John Dos Passos, **The 42nd Parallel**
- William Faulkner, [**As I Lay Dying**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying_%28novel%29)
- Milt Gross, [**He Done Her Wrong**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Done_Her_Wrong)
- Langston Hughes, [**Not Without Laughter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Without_Laughter)
- Georgia Douglas Johnson, [**Blue Eyed Black Boy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-Eyed_Black_Boy)
- Franz Kafka, [**The Castle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_%28novel%29) in English translation
- "Carolyn Keene," [**The Secret of the Old Clock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_the_Old_Clock) plus three others (two each by Harriet Adams and Patricia Doll) in the Nancy Drew series
- Oliver La Farge, [**Laughing Boy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Boy_%28novel%29)
- Watty Piper's version of [**The Little Engine That Could**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could)
- Elizabeth Madox Roberts, **The Great Meadow**
- Upton Sinclair, [**Mental Radio**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Radio)
- Thornton Wilder, [**The Woman of Andros**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_of_Andros)

You can find a variety of other items continuing broader franchises, too, or novel editions of serialized works, not to mention plenty of non-fiction.  Oh, and not as literary, but the first few months of Chic Young's [**Blondie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_%28comic_strip%29) go on the list, as well; we'll see a bit more on that later.

#### Film {% emoji movie camera %}

This list gets fairly long, as cinema becomes more popular, so I'll skip sifting through for specifics and point you to [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1930).  Of them, the ten highest-grossing films of the year and the two additional films that won members of their casts Academy Awards would probably draw the most attention.  [**Whoopee!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopee!_%28film%29) has more than a whiff of racial issues, but also presents a musical featuring *My Baby Just Cares for Me*, and filmed in color.  [**All Quiet on the Western Front**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front_%281930_film%29) adapts the 1929 German novel.

You'll also find serials, another Hitchcock film, more adaptations---Hollywood has run out of ideas, I guess---and much more that you might recognize.  Maybe most important, we have **Hell-Bound Train**, admittedly a bland screed against the nightclub culture growing around jazz, but stands as one of the few remaining early film primarily developed by a Black woman, in this case [Eloyce Gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloyce_King_Patrick_Gist).

Oh, and because no Public Domain Day conversation would feel complete without the obligatory "Down with Disney" moment, you'll also find nine (I think) more Mickey Mouse cartoons, plus the small first batch of the comic strip that caused Malibu Comics so much grief with **The Uncensored Mouse**[^0M69I0].

[^0M69I0]:  If I wanted to obsess over Disney, I'd actually call this the headline.  Unlike the uninteresting animated shorts, the comics actually present Mickey with something approaching a personality and history, turning him into more of a character than "cheaper to cast than Charlie Chaplin."  That said, read and adapt them at your own risk, given the sometimes extensive racism.

![The first Mickey Mouse comic strip, where he dozes off on a haystack fantasizing about becoming a great aviator like Lindbergh, dreaming about meeting his idol until he walks off the haystack and crashes out of his dream, concluding that he should build a plane of his own and learn to fly](/blog/assets/1930-01-13-Mickey-Mouse.png "Less annoying than the animated version, too...")

The first five Looney Tunes shorts also lose copyright protection, even as the fate of Warner Brothers in our era sits in limbo, if you have ever wanted Mickey---or [Maxim McMouster]({% post_url 2024-01-28-mouse %}), if you prefer my trademark-free iteration on the character---to cross over with [Bosko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosko); likewise with [Flip the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_the_Frog) and [Toby the Pup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_the_Pup), though Flip already crossed over with an off-brand Mickey in [*Fiddlesticks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddlesticks_%281930_film%29), now also definitely in the public domain.  Oh, and most people also probably use [Betty Boop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Boop) as their headline, even though many of her later appearances lost copyright protection first, and if she doesn't team up with Blondie Boopadoop[^jN0ukJ] for somebody's story, I don't even know why *anybody* cares about the public domain anymore...

[^jN0ukJ]:  Feel free to throw in fellow flapper [Fritzi Ritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzi_Ritz), too, and mark your calendars for 2029 when her niece Nancy hits the public domain, though not the Nancy living in a surreal world that the Internet has grown to love.

Here, unfortunate leg-staring due to my limited graphical attention aside, we even already have our first plot for the crossover.

![Betty Boop replacing Dagwood's father in the first comic.  Dagwood introduces his new bashful-and-shy fiancée Blondie, and she says that she feels so boo-boop-a-doop when meeting her dates' parents](/blog/assets/boop-a-doop-ing.png "Boo-Boop-a-Doop, indeed.")

See?  Shoe comparison *and* trademark infringement.  How *dare* someone else use the same flapper catchphrase...?

Unrelated, at some point, somebody needs to explain to me why everybody seems to agree that Betty originally looked like an anthropomorphic poodle, because I have never seen a poodle that looked *anything* like that.

#### Music and Other {% emoji musical notes %}

Note that, beyond the following list, music *recordings* began falling into the national public domain in 2022, a first in United States history.  Prior to that, "phonorecord" copyrights have had varying governance by state, with some states having no relevant laws and so no copyright expiration.  This year gives us (I believe) recordings from 1925, with year-by-year expirations until the 1947 batch, after which these copyright expirations will pause for fifteen years[^_MD9ck].

[^_MD9ck]:  Prepare now for the inevitable moaning in 2048 about the "flowering of creativity" that copyright deprives us for not letting us copy either version of *Woody Woodpecker* that charted on Billboard in 1948.  Also start working now to figure out how two versions of that nightmarish slop charted on Billboard during 1948...

However, we also have these compositions, including a couple of full musicals.  I'll hit a handful of highlights.

- The Gershwin brothers provide us with [*But Not for Me*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/But_Not_for_Me_%28song%29), [*Embraceable You*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraceable_You), [*I've Got a Crush on You*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ve_Got_a_Crush_on_You), and [*I Got Rhythm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Got_Rhythm), several of which come from [**Girl Crazy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Crazy).
- Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell's [*Georgia on My Mind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_on_My_Mind).
- Cole Porter and Herbert Fields, [**The New Yorkers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorkers).
- Leo Robin, Richard A. Whiting, and W. Franke Harling's [*Beyond the Blue Horizon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Blue_Horizon_%28song%29), known best for the George Olsen recording.  Relevant to other posts on the blog, Alexander Courage credited the song as one inspiration for the **Star Trek** theme, specifically the slow, upbeat melody over a more rapid backing.
- Kay Swift, Paul James, and David Ogden Stewart's [**Fine and Dandy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_and_Dandy_%28musical%29).

And again, You can find much more.  In fact, as mentioned, we have slowly started getting batches of sound recordings through 1925.  For example, four years after the copyright on the composition of [*Sweet Georgia Brown*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Georgia_Brown) expired, Ben Bernie's famous orchestral version follows it.

The same goes for Marian Anderson's rendition of [*Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Knows_the_Trouble_I%27ve_Seen).

We also get a smattering of Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Gene Austin, and more.

![The main panel of Prometheus](/blog/assets/Prometheus-1930-José-Clemente-Orozco-Pomona-College.png "Bad for your liver...")

And in the visual arts, we have plenty that you might recognize, including John Steuart Curry's [*Hogs Killing a Snake*](https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-steuart-curry/hogs-killing-a-snake-1930), Edward Hopper's [*Early Sunday Morning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Sunday_Morning), Alice Neel's nude portrait of [*Ethel Ashton*](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/neel-ethel-ashton-t13703), Georgia O'Keeffe's [*Red Rust Hills*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Red_Hills) as indicated a couple of sections back, José Clemente Orozco's [*Prometheus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_%28Orozco%29) in part pictured above, Charles Sheeler's [*American Landscape*](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79032), Edward Trumbull's [*Transport and Human Endeavor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_and_Human_Endeavor), Grant Wood's [*American Gothic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gothic) among others, N.C. Wyeth's [*Reception to Washington on April 21, 1789, at Trenton on his way to New York to Assume the Duties of the Presidency of the United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_to_Washington_on_April_21,_1789,_at_Trenton_on_his_way_to_New_York_to_Assume_the_Duties_of_the_Presidency_of_the_United_States), Ulysses Anthony Ricci's [*Statler Fountain*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statler_Fountain), and a lot more.

#### Beyond the United States {% emoji globe europe africa %}

In a lot of the rest of the world, instead, you look at material created by people who died more than seventy years ago.  Therefore, you'd want to look for authors, songwriters, or other artists who died in 1954 to access their work.

#### A Free Culture Plea

At some point, I started to add this in every year, but while you think about what you might do with all the material dropped into the public domain, this year, please take a moment to think about *giving back* to culture.

I have mentioned this before, I know, but for the most part, I have found that the communities that tend to grow around public domain works tend to focus on exploiting the works by creating new works under copyright with no sharing intended, even while complaining about longer copyright terms or bashing Disney for exploiting the public domain but never giving back.  You have every right to do that, yes.  The term "public domain" literally refers to ownership by the people.  However, complaining about people pulling the ladders up after them, then doing exactly that makes you the problem, not Disney, in this case.

If you think that copyright law has grown out of control, then please consider slapping a public license on your public domain-exploiting work, so that the next person can follow your lead.  I suggest (and use) CC BY-SA or other reciprocal/copyleft license[^XTEY-M], because that choice requires that next person to share, too.  You can't out-lobby the big studios and publishers---I mean, you *can*, but you need millions of people angry enough to constantly remind their representatives about the problem, and (no offense) I doubt that anybody reading here has that kind of clout---but you can participate in building a studio-resistant body of work that encourages participation.

[^XTEY-M]:  As examples, if you don't care for the specifics of [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), consider the [Free Art License](https://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/), the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), or the prototype versions of [Copyleft Next](https://next.copyleft.org/).  I have my eye on the last one, assuming that the new enthusiasm by the authors goes further than moving it to a bespoke domain.

## Science and Technology {% emoji alembic %}

I honestly can't think of any impending science or technology breakthroughs on the horizon.  Perhaps someone would like to enlighten me on something that I've missed in the comments?  I suppose that we can all look forward to the AI bubble popping and {% emoji crossed fingers %} hoping that it doesn't take the global economy with it...

![A Mini Fantasy Theater comic at a New Year's Eve party, where the anti-AI witch asks her Avian Intelligence how to make resolutions stick, getting the stock answer of breaking down the goal into smaller goals.  In the background, the older witches cheer the new world of Avian Intelligence, and the witch asks how to break down destroying the industry into smaller steps](/blog/assets/2025-12-31-en-033-minifantasytheater.png "I can relate...")

Seriously, I think that the companies, by now, have made it clear that they won't make tools that do anything *useful*, so...can they politely go away, maybe?

## Law and Politics {% emoji balance scale %}

In the United States---last year, I really only had "ugh" to say about the situation---we really only have one story to watch.  We have spent the past year watching the rogue ~~Musk administration~~ Trump administration enacting Project 2025, the far-right plan for disassembling the administrative state and pluralistic democracy.

Yeah, like I said, **ugh**.  I stand by that assessment.

However, over the course of the year, people have risen up.  From protests, to courts (not all, but many) siding with the Constitution over partisan politics, to their own unforced errors such as the debacle over keeping the Epstein files in the news by trying to cover them up, trying to gerrymander already-gerrymandered states, and repeatedly trying to cast "affordability" as mythological, things have changed dramatically.  Months ago, the administration acted like they'd have power forever, and polls consistently suggested that significant parts of the country might embrace that.

Now, they flail, with signs pointing to the administration not having much power at all in the future.  Polls have turned sharply against them.  Members of Congress have started running for the exits, which could give Democrats the chance to take control of the House of Representatives soon, with the 2026 elections *potentially* giving them all of Congress, putting a much more serious obstacle in their path than Mike "I don't know anything about it" Johnson.

They'll still do a lot of damage to people, as cornered animals always do, and as we can see with their literal invasion of Venezuela, but less than if they had all the levers of power at their disposal.  And at the end, if we---the people, you and me, not some hypothetical shadowy elite that we hope works on the side of progressive causes[^MrlJ7o]---keep up the pressure, we should even start seeing consequences for their actions.

[^MrlJ7o]:  I have said many times before that social progress succeeds or fails based on whether the people bother to pressure the government.  In the United States, noted racist LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act into law, and proto-Trump Nixon helped create the EPA.  Did they do it because they suddenly wanted to get on the right side of history?  No, the angry population *terrified* them into standing on the right side of history.

### Evergreen Advice

I bring this up every so often, and probably even have a post around here, somewhere, but please take that "public pressure" idea to heart.  We got here by treating democracy as a "fire and forget" system.  "We elected {Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden}, so they need to fix everything" got us Ronald Reagan, two George Bushes, and Donald Trump *twice*.  Other countries have a similar situation.

What happens, in that case?  Because the people give up their voice, lobbyists convince those "saviors" that *everybody thinks* that they should go do something else.  Then, the billionaire-owned media tells you that the Democrats have failed.  And then people don't vote the next time, because "voting doesn't work."

The best, most effective activists say "you vote to elect your preferred political opponent," the person---of those likely to win---who you'd most like to push to enact better policies.  The worst activists post on social media that so-and-so "must" enact this policy immediately, and scream about "betrayals" because they haven't gotten their pet policies enacted[^ADGjxw].

[^ADGjxw]:  I call them "the worst" as a charitable act.  I'd actually call it a better-than-even chance that they would prefer to see the fascists win, because they have no plan beyond getting non-fascists out of office as "punishment."

Ideally, every month---feel free to make this your 2026 resolution---you should write all your representatives, on paper, mailed with stamps, no matter their political affiliation, and at both their offices, with the following[^VgBepY].

[^VgBepY]:  As briefly as you can manage, so that somebody might actually read it.

- An introduction to why they should care what you think.  "As a constituent, a small-dollar donor, a small business owner, a veteran, a parent of a child with a disability," and so forth, everything honest that sets you apart or connects you with an issue,
- The biggest issues that you see as urgent---due to upcoming votes, hearings, or assorted crises---your positions on them, and why it matters to you,
- An offer to provide more information on the topics.

Those, edited down to no more than a couple of pages, should get mailed to each of the following.

- The representative who most directly impacts that issue through voting or participation in a hearing,
- The representatives at the next-smallest scale, asking them to put pressure on the first person, and
- The representatives at the next-largest scale, similarly asking them to put pressure on the first person.

For example, in the United States, if you target your member of the House of Representatives, then you also send to your state legislator(s) and Senators.  Regardless of the specifics, that increases the chance of them actually hearing you.

Each of these people probably has *two* offices, one near you and the other at the seat of government.  You want to send one copy to each location, identifying that the other office and people have received a copy.  If you have the capacity, regularly schedule meetings when representatives work out of their offices near you to follow up, too.

That makes you the person who, when your name comes up, they audibly groan, because they know that lobbyists will probably give up before you give up your nagging.  Somebody needs to file all that paper, unlike the e-mail that you sent, the voicemail that you couldn't leave because the community filled up the box, or the online petition that you signed, all of which gets summarized on a spreadsheet that nobody reads or gets ignored outright.

Does this require a lot of work and a significant amount of money?  Yes.  Do you have millions of dollars to out-lobby the big companies in your area or the social capital to organize mass demonstrations at your representatives' offices until they agree with you, to spread the effort?  Again, I'd bet that you do not.

## Personal Plans

Increasingly an irritant to me, I find that my plans for each year look like the years before it.  I managed to spend time on stenography for a few months, but not really much else, for example.

### Writing

First, once again, **The Light's Edge** failed to launch.  Those of you who read the newsletter have some background on what I intend to work with, and some of where the delay comes from.  But the fact remains that, for two years now, I have insisted that I had it coming Real Soon Now&#x2122;, and haven't made much progress on getting it from draft to production.

Having learned my lesson, I won't commit to getting it out anytime soon for a third time...

In addition to trying to get that moving again, since [revising my novel]({% post_url 2025-09-14-revisit-silver-bat %}), I have had the itch to produce more books using the same process.  I have my short stories that could become an anthology.  My translation of an old French science fiction novel has sat on my hard drive for about twenty years.  I have often said that I want to edit the *Real Life in Star Trek* posts into a conclusions-first, well-cited book, probably on a per-show basis.  I have old lecture notes, abandoned projects, back-stories, and more.  Something will grab me for this, I hope.

Oh, and I have the germ of one project to contribute elsewhere, at least initially, something that'll stretch me a bit...

### Entropy Arbitrage

Alongside continuing to work on that, though, even though I have managed to get thirty-four Sunday posts out for 2025, the most so far, I still want to get more done, there.  The new [calendar index](/blog/calendar) especially brings the *lack* of posts into focus, by showing tracts of empty space in March and April.

Now that I have the parallel tags and labels set up, I also need to populate the labels back in history, so that the labels actually provide some utility.

I may not get to it, but after almost a year and a half looking at the blog's [dark color scheme]({% post_url 2024-08-14-dark-mode-again %}), I like it enough that the light color scheme strikes me as slightly muddled.  As such, I would like to clean it up, give it a higher contrast without losing the variation of the "pen on old paper" feel.  And even though I already translated the colors to the [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) color-space, which lets me think in terms of hues instead of abstract red/green/blue values, I would like to move to [OK LCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space), which would take the hue-by-hue guesswork out of the lightness values.

And I have mentioned this before, too, and I still don't have any idea *how*, but I'd like to I'd still like to turn the blog into more of a conversation with all of you.  It doesn't necessarily need to sit on the blog itself---I have the [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org), for example, that nobody uses but my announcement script, and the bridges for Webmentions shows when people on the Fediverse take an interest in a post---but having my voice echoing around in my space without much else doesn't really help anybody.

If anybody would rather discuss the topics on the blog (and more generally) somewhere else, get in touch so that we can see if it'll work better.

#### Posts

As a sampling of posts that I plan to publish this year, because I have already worked on them to some degree, I might as well provide everybody with some quick previews...

- Expect me to continue the *Defining Free Culture* posts[^f8Sjsv].  Next up, the responsibilities inherent to Culture Freedom
- More *What Could Free Culture Do with Thirty Million Dollars?* ideas, including at least a modernized take---which yes, should strike fear into your heart---on the police procedural that would work well
- My answer to the insipid *How Do You Use AI in Development?* question that now pervades job applications
- The story of that time that I accidentally invented social media over lunch and immediately explained why it would go wrong
- Maybe a [*Let's Fix...*](/blog/tag/lets-fix) post that starts with a public domain character who could stand in for a certain mature woman mystery writer and amateur detective, but could spin out to encompass much more in her quirky hometown.
- Another *Let's Fix...* post, outlining ideas for a possible high-fantasy world that tries to do something new with many overused tropes, and borrows heavily from Free Culture works

[^f8Sjsv]:  Notionally jumping back a couple of sections, despite my better judgment, it looks a lot like these posts will eventually turn into a book, as well.  Including the posts that started me on the path to that series---[why I care about Free Culture]({% post_url 2023-06-25-free-culture %}), the [flagging movement]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}), and my thoughts on [rethinking copyright]({% post_url 2025-05-18-copyright-thoughts %})---I already have about thirty-five thousand words, with more posts to come.  In each post, I joke about not wanting the posts to become an "unhinged rambling manifesto," but it seems to *really* want to do that...

And the pettiest preview?  I eagerly look forward to next month when I can start blotting **Star Trek:  The Next Generation** out of my memory and start watching **Deep Space Nine** for a couple of years.  I know that I'll need to keep tolerating a couple of the characters, but their films have pushed me close to the breaking point with their absurd blend of incongruous action scenes, horrible behavior, constant shtick, and apparent poor memory of the series.

I also have an idea that I like a lot, but could become a short story or an annoyed screed...

#### Illustration

Oh, before I forget, some of you might have already noticed the first steps in a newer approach to posts over the last couple of weeks, but in 2026, I want to take a more useful approach to the posts' header images.

Over the past six years, I have found some images that fit my intent with a given post perfectly, on occasion, and have occasionally combined and edited multiple images to come up with something semi-clever in a couple of cases.  On the whole, though, for lack of a more polite term, I have half-assed it.  In too many cases, I have given [Openverse](https://openverse.org/) keywords from the post and picked the first unobjectionable image that it finds.

My process might not change too much for the [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-diary) posts, because I can't think of a better illustration of holidays than people participating in the holiday or what the holiday celebrates, and the Friday posts will probably continue to use a consistent weekly image even if I change the image on occasion, fair warning.  However, for other sets of posts, this approach has bothered me for a few reasons, especially since that process usually turn up photographs.

- The photographs tend to have relatively low quality, composition-wise.
- I usually feel compelled to blur any faces and brands in the image.
- The photographers tend not to have or want careers in the field, and uploaded the photographs a long time ago, making crediting them seem almost silly[^jR58a1].
- Speaking of credit, since most images come from Flickr, this sometimes means dealing with [copyright owners abusing the Creative Commons 2.0 licenses]({% post_url 2022-02-20-shakedown %}) to ask everybody to point the URL wherever a client pays them to redirect it for an SEO boost.

[^jR58a1]:  I mean that in the sense that using their work will probably have no effect on their lives, and they likely won't even know.  For example, in my post about [fictional identifiers]({% post_url 2025-07-20-naming %}), I needed to throw credit at Jack Dorsey, seemingly a waste of everybody's time.  That doesn't make crediting the work (when used) any less important, though.

Giving credit to people who, on the whole, probably don't care if you follow the link to their profile probably bothers me the most of these issues, because an alternative exists.  If the choice of header image doesn't really matter much for a specific post as long as it gets the general point across, then I might as well try to prioritize sketches, paintings, and other visual media by artists who specifically make their work available for reuse under Free Culture licenses.

Mind you, I have occasionally picked art by David Revoy when it happened to fit.  However, it hasn't occurred to me until recently to *start* the search with those artists, instead of using them as a secondary option after lazy searches fail.

I can't guarantee that this will pan out as I envision.  Finding the artists take a surprising amount of fighting search engines wanting to provide everything except the requested information---I currently have a list of only seven artists plus three who don't really make sense for the context---especially filtering out the artists who have inexplicably shifted to churning out AI slop[^sV8F_N].  And many topics won't lend themselves to what an artist happens to have created; for example, the end-of-year posts have a theme of an animal with large eyes gazing off to the left.  But I'd like to push the blog more in that direction, using the credits to point readers to people who could probably use our support, instead of somebody who happened to post a casual photograph, when that seems feasible.

[^sV8F_N]:  I should note that one of my candidates says that they have trained a local image-generation model with years of their own work and hand-edit the output, which I *might* consider when an image fits particularly well.  But I doubt that any will...

### Social Media

Last year, I considered trying to become more active on social media, but I don't see that working out.  In some ways, I have, in that I have posted a handful of offhand thoughts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag).  And I do reply to people when they post something that resonates with me on a level where I feel that I have something relevant to say.  But in other cases, my circle doesn't really seem participatory in that sense.

Beyond that, I feel like I might want to trim down social media, again.  [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/@jcolag) doesn't seem likely to expand beyond the PHP and Laravel community.  [Spoutible](https://spoutible.com/jcolag) and [Sez Us](https://sez.us/user/jcolag) increasingly feel like the worst of Twitter, people trying to game for engagement rather than having a conversation.  I even see it creeping into Mastodon, with a resurrection of even the insipid "boost if you agree" nonsense.

Otherwise, my social media usage seems mostly stable for the moment.  Other than the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag)---where, by the way, you can see my takes on the media that I watched or listened to, if you miss seeing that kind of talk in these New Year posts---I generally think to post to Mastodon first, then [Diaspora](https://nota.404.mn/people/e4313920967a0136074b076893c08a76) if it crosses my mind and if the server doesn't have problems.  Everything else has become a distant afterthought.

Maybe I'll look at moving to another Mastodon server, at some point.  I haven't had any trouble with Mastodon.social, but when supporting a decentralized community, it doesn't really make sense to do it from the most centralized part.  It might make sense to find another Matrix server, too, though I don't suppose that they have the same level of migration support as Mastodon does.

And I still can't seem to find the motivation to sign up for Bluesky.  Maybe they allow web-based registration by now, but they keep taking the worst possible approaches to moderation and embracing the wrong people.  And as expected, the attempts at decentralizing the community still requires the goodwill of "Bluesky proper," because they designed the protocol that way.

### The Newsletter

Speaking of the newsletter, I have mentioned this multiple times, but I have taken Mailchimp out of my process.  As of Thursday, I can no longer hand its API an HTML file to create the mailer.  It doesn't make sense to keep using the service, then, so the newsletter starting with this month's will only go out through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).

Personally, I think I make it worth signing up, if only because you get to watch me struggle to explain some of the complete nonsense that the library streaming services make available without any of their credits.

I want to look into two possibilities in the next couple of months.

First, because I suppose that I shouldn't trust Buy Me a Coffee in the long term any more than I trusted Mailchimp/Intuit in the short term, I should probably look for a secondary newsletter platform.  Eventually, someone will buy out the company, or they'll go out of business, or they'll want to squeeze me for more revenue, or some other problem.  Having another platform gives someplace to flee to.

Second, I should probably find someplace to archive the old newsletter issues[^Jn1ZjL].  I don't necessarily want to leave them in the usual locations---the blog, another corner of my website, a Codeberg Pages silo, or the like---since the newsletter largely exists for writing that doesn't quite fit the style or context of the blog.

[^Jn1ZjL]:  If it went out through Buy Me a Coffee, you actually can [read them there](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag/posts/71215).  I mean archiving them as plain Markdown or HTML somewhere that I "own."

Yet, even if I "embargo" each issue for a month or two before pushing it out, it makes sense to have them *somewhere* that I control, in case it becomes useful to someone.  I have no idea what that looks like, but I'd like to keep it in mind.

### Software

This year, you can probably expect to see more work from me with semantic indexing.  Since AI probably won't pack up and go away, it seems worth using a local version for the one thing that it actually does do well, turning prose into a set of numbers that indicate an estimated meaning.

I won't integrate it with the blog searches, because that would require deploying an embedding model to the server, and it would slow searches down as it processes the query strings.  But locally, "where did I write about that?" takes up a lot of energy that justifies taking that first part of an AI chat---the "what does this request mean" part---and comparing it to the "meaning" of every paragraph.

Also, for those who don't necessarily remember, I have published a variety of low-effort games over the past couple of years.

- [Chasing Phantoms](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/ChasingPhantoms/)
- The [Daily Nonogram](https://john.colagioia.net/nono/)
- [Iungimoji!](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/iungimoji/)
- [G.L.O.B.E.](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/g-l-o-b-e/)
- [Kabang!]({% post_url 2023-08-13-kabang %})
- [Mystic T-Square](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/mystic-t-square/)
- [SaLaVI](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/salavi/)

I may have missed a couple, but I like this little collection, because they have almost nothing to do with each other, beyond most of them running on HTML and JavaScript.  And I would like to both continue and buck that trend, this year.  For the former, I would like to fill out the set with an "incremental game," some sort of adventure game, and so forth.  And for the latter, I would like to start taking what I have learned with these games and start putting the ideas together into more complex systems.

I can also imagine more serious projects, but I don't have any solid ideas for them.  Part of me wants something ambitious enough to recruit some of my fellow job-hunting colleagues to see if we can make something of it.  If anybody has an interest in that sort of thing and an idea, you know where to find me.

## To the Future {% emoji champagne %}

That summarizes my outlook for the year ahead, I think.  What do *you* look forward to---or worry about---seeing in 2026?
