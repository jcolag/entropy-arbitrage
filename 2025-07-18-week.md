As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

As hinted, I hate doing that sort of thing, but if anybody has leads, I'd appreciate them, as would the people who I should probably pay for things.

He also noted the absence of consistent marine protection around CÃ¡t BÃ , unlike the focused inland conservation efforts.

It does, in fact, look like a terrible idea, not that I know nearly enough about the area to actually understand the impact...

I believe that OpenExo has made the rounds for a long time, in various forms, but that doesn't make it any less satisfying to see the project seeing more success.

The article suffers from a bit too much hand-waving, for my tastes, but I suppose that I can understand why.

Higher prices for a worse (and more dangerous) product certainly does fit the Republican brand, though they like to call it "freedom."

You know, at this point, we could probably forgive an outside observer for believing that the Trump administration has a goal of making the country worse in every respect.  Otherwise, we'd need to believe that they have no competence at anything...

Not my greatest insight, but seriously, we could push these people into *such* inane crises by giving them a solid thwack with everything that unnerves them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Tech designed for improving public dialogue is possible â€“ and can even work in the middle of a war zone. In 2024, the [Alliance for Middle East Peace](https://www.allmep.org/ai-pulse/) began using [Remesh.ai](https://www.remesh.ai/), an AI-based platform, to find areas of common ground between Israelis and Palestinians in order to advance the idea of a public peace process and [identify elements of a ceasefire agreement](https://doi.org/10.1145/3715275.3732022).

I suspect that the wide-eyed excitement about AI will prove ill-advised, but this does provide steps forward on making (especially the Free Software) systems better.
