## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Masks

Since the last post, **Deep Space Nine** discovers an isolated village where people have begun vanishing without a trace, while romance springs up back home, in *Shadowplay*.

This episode, though, feels like a rehash of so many other plots, once again in service of taking a break from the whole *Star Trek* thing and maximizing Brent Spiner's screen time...

 > **ERIC**: But Mrs. Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as realistic as possible.

We've talked before about the undue pressure that this culture seemingly puts on their young, but instructing *children* to make realistic-as-possible sculptures feels like a new level down from their usual.  Plus, with their technology, absolute fidelity seems like the lazier route, no?  It seems like anybody has the ability to create a perfect representation of a bird.

I mean, in our time, with ubiquitous photography, do many people try to *compete* with that by creating photorealistic images?  I've noted elsewhere, for example, that mainstream comic book artists mostly stopped drawing planets in our Solar System, once you could download high-resolution images from NASA without even needing to credit them.  Except for every hack comedian (incorrectly) finding it hilarious to read Trump's statements in an exaggeration of his voice, impressionists---performers, usually comedians, whose act primarily consists of mimicking the voices and mannerisms of famous people---have all but vanished when portable recording devices became common, too.

 > **DATA**: I have finished. The dimensions are accurate to within one-point-three percent.

A casual glance at the wavy boundaries on the screen on such a small sculpture would seem to suggest that he did *not* keep his accuracy to one-point-three percent, but let's let that go.  I do want to ask, though, how the hyper-accurate, hyper-pedantic machine-person, the same person who spent half the series estimating multi-day spans of time to fractions of a second (less than one one-thousandth of one percent tolerance) decided that margin of error would work.  As we've seen hinted with other aspects of Data's personality, does his obsession with precision really only come down to a put-on to fit the expectations that people have of an android?

 > **DATA**: Counselor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can I reproduce a sound with clay?

He has spent the last couple of years wasting our time with dreams and metaphors, and now he wants to tell us that he can't figure out how to represent a *physical phenomenon*---vibrations traveling through matter---in a physical medium?  I'll grant you that it should take some non-trivial effort to figure out how to represent a *transient* situation, and then exaggerate the shaking to visibility, but if he insists on playing this literally, then I refuse to believe that he wouldn't immediately see how to sculpt his favorite piece of music, whether he comes up with an amplitude wave or the exaggerated displacement of an object's surface as notes pass through it.

 > **DATA**: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eighty-seven million years.
 >
 > **RIKER**: That's a long time alone in the dark.

Not really, though, right?  At least, it doesn't seem like a particularly long time in transit for a conventional object.

For example, I've brought up the [Parker Solar Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe) before, which quickly became the fastest human-made device, hitting a peak of 191 km/s last year.  If it maintained that speed, that would equate to a bit over 6×10<sup>12</sup> m/year.  At that speed, eighty-seven million years would get it 524×10<sup>18</sup> m away, or 55.4 thousand light years, or about a fifth of the Milky Way's diameter.

That sounds like an improbable run to cover, but near our part of the galaxy, at least, we estimate the stellar density as 0.004 stars per cubic light year.  Figure an average star has a radius of 7.35×10<sup>-8</sup> light years, and we consider other material negligible.  Calculating the typical star volume from its radius and distributing four thousandths of it across the cube, and I get something like a probability of collision while traveling through a given light year stretch of the galaxy as roughly 7×10<sup>−17</sup>.

And from there, the odds of colliding with something during those eighty-seven million years comes to less than---I could do this right, by subtracting out the pairs of probabilities, since we don't care about multiple impacts, but instead I'll multiply the chances of collision by the number of light years---one in twenty-six billion.

Objects exist that move much faster than Parker did, but most interstellar comets seem to move slower, about an order of magnitude less.  And regardless, you can see by our back-of-the-envelope calculations that an object would need to move at many times the speed of light (or move to a denser part of the galaxy, such as the core) to bump those overall odds of collision to something that we'd consider significant.  All that to say that "alone in the dark" in the galaxy seems like the normal state for any timescale that you'd care to consider.  It seems far more remarkable that they found it, not that nobody else could have...

By the way, if this comet holds true to form with speeds of tens of kilometers per second, and it probably originated two sectors away, that gives us a rough size of a sector, somewhere between two and five light years across, though I can't imagine that we'd find any consistency if we looked back over the series.

 > **CRUSHER**: Worf says he's going to teach us some mok'bara throwing techniques today.
 >
 > **TROI**: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sore for a week.

I guess that their date at the end of [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}) went well.

Sorry.  Inappropriate.  I couldn't resist.

 > **CRUSHER**: Maybe Will left it for you. A little present?

Does Riker have a habit of leaving gifts for his ex, that Crusher would make that jump?  If so, that feels like (yet more) sexual harassment, both heaping attention on somebody who (as memory serves) rejected him and giving a strong impression to the rest of the crew that he openly favors anybody who he wants to sleep with.

 > **TROI**: That's an interesting thought

Thanks for telling us to find that interesting, Troi.  I would never have considered it as such, so the prompting helps...

 > **DATA**: I followed your advice, Counselor. I used my imagination.
 >
 > **TROI**: That's an understatement.

Unless he wants to claim that the mask represents *music* from his last scene (which would have impressed me), I don't know that I agree that this represents some incredibly impressive display of imagination.  I can't think of a human culture that hasn't used masks in some capacity.  This doesn't even reach particularly far into obscure cultures, since you can see the fairly typical Venetian carnival base---reflected in the post's header image---without the lavish decoration, but with some vague "primitive" aspects thrown in, which we'll talk about a bit later.

 > **ERIC**: Excuse me, Counselor. Can you help me with my terminal? It's not working right.

They apparently call Troi---the one who couldn't tell a pipe from the thing pushing stuff through pipes in [*Thine Own Self*]({% post_url 2025-09-11-thine-own-self %}), don't forget---for technical support...

 > **LAFORGE**: Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our computer core. I don't know how it's working, but it's reconfiguring our systems.

Wait, this all seems familiar.  Didn't we already do this in [*Contagion*]({% post_url 2023-02-02-contagion %})...?  More to the point, they apparently still haven't bothered to protect their computer systems from invasive programs.

 > **RIKER**: Maybe it's about time we found out. Could we use the phasers to melt down the shell of the comet?

Eighty-seven million years, and he wants to crack it open like an egg to see what he can pillage.

 > **DATA**: I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over eighty-seven million years old.
 >
 > **RIKER**: That's older than the comet itself. Could someone from the D'Arsay system have built it?

First off, it qualifies as older to the extent that they aged it at eight-seven million years and this as "over" that, but without more specifics, that sounds like a rounding error, not massively older.

Second, yes, the thing inside the comet predates the crap that accumulated around it, rather than growing inside the ice from a mechanical zygote later.  Brilliant deduction, Holmes.

 > **PICARD**: There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now. But perhaps eighty-seven million years ago, there were.

Remember, Picard loves a New Age "maybe the ancients knew a lot of things that we didn't" story.

Speaking of the New Age thing, you might notice that, overlaid on the Venetian-style masks, the props largely misappropriate symbols from haphazard Native American and Central American cultures.  For example, you might recognize Masaka's symbol from New Mexico's flag, where they adapted it from the native [Zia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zia_people_%28New_Mexico%29), a circle with groups of spokes at the cardinal directions.  Korgano's symbol doesn't come from that part of the hemisphere, but seems to draw inspiration from the "arc of the sky" symbol depicted around [Coricancha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coricancha).  Other glyphs seem to take loose inspiration from the composite squares used in [Maya script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script).  But it all gets used as a marker for "foreign" and "ancient," without any attempt to assimilate them into a coherent design language or show any interest in the cultures.

 > **RIKER**: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading any further. But we still have alien symbols floating around on our computer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen these things all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive and non-functional.

Notice the miasma of nonsense that Riker spreads, here.  They have contained the problem, but it has still spread throughout the system, so...they contained it in the entire ship, I guess.  But also, this foreign stuff all looks the same to him, and definitely has no use.

 > **PICARD**: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there. These artifacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think.

And Picard, not to have the minion outdo him, decides that they have it for advanced...religious stuff.  For a religion that he knows nothing about, from a people he doesn't even actually know exist...

Also, he makes a big deal about ritual, but notice again that he uses it to mark the culture as "other," because I'd bet that he doesn't consider his own society ritualistic, despite the two kinds of uniforms---daily and ceremonial---the jewelry marking them as members of the same group and their level within the order, their jargon, and their literal rituals such as handing off authority between shifts and the log entries that often don't say much of relevance.  But *those people*, from the ancient world, have ritualistic and ceremonial to their artifacts, seemingly because he gets to call them artifacts instead of tools.

In other words, Picard dismisses this culture's artifacts exactly as Riker did, as all the same and non-functional.  But he used more sophisticated-sounding words to do it, and also used it to dismiss the people as weird and superstitious.

 > **RIKER**: And death? One of the symbols was death.
 >
 > **PICARD**: The ultimate boundary.

The final frontier, you might say.  Wait, did I accidentally pitch **Star Trek:  [Flatliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatliners)**?  I'd probably give it more of a chance than I gave **Strange New Worlds**, at least.

 > **DATA**: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind?

How often has something reprogrammed him---including the aforementioned *Contagion*---replaced his personality, or otherwise manipulated him, and he needs to ask someone *else* what it feels like to lose his mind?  At this point, I would consider him the expert in the field.

 > **TROI**: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities.

We now use the term [dissociative identity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder), as we've shifted more to thinking about the issues for the individual to deal with over the occasionally dramatic visible symptoms.  However, it seems worth noting---especially because we have Data involved---that an ongoing debate exists as to how much of the disorder comes entirely from medical causes and how much comes from treatment looking for and so encouraging distinct personalities.

 > **WORF**: We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship. Part of deck twelve is now an aqueduct.
 >
 > **TROI**: What are we being transformed into?

I mean...the aqueduct seems like a pretty heavy clue pointing to a city, no?  Or does an aqueduct fall too far inside the "conduit" category that she had so much trouble with last week, so the term sounds like nonsense to her?

 > **PICARD**: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, with Masaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her.

Note the phrasing of "access," before suggesting conversation, when referring to a presumed head of state, as if he sees her as a tool.

 > **TROI**: And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be in ascendance at any given time.

I'll try to treat this generously and assume that she meant "ascendance" as in dominance, rather than literally rising in the sky, which I believe we all know that---even on Earth---you can get the Sun and Moon rising at around the same time.  Even so, though, it seems wrong to suggest that no planet anywhere has a situation where one of the solar system's stars and a satellite with equal prominence at some point.

 > **PICARD**: In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbol represents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyone has a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it.

Again, for all Picard knows, he has stumbled on a novel civilization hosting a novel form of life, possibly still alive and trying to reestablish itself by creating a colony on any body that it can access on its millennia-long trek, an idea that *Riker* of all character floats as a possibility, I find in a deleted scene.  And the captain wants to control its apparent leader, because their (possible) attempt at survival has inconvenienced him by altering "his" ship.

 > **PICARD**: You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. This is a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps we should try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehow incorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen to me.

He *made that up*, remember, to dismiss the value of the artifacts.  And he has taken that fiction so that he can make himself the hero of the story.  But then he won't even follow through enough to actually contend with the clear romantic overtones of the mythology that he has decided to embody.  And yes, I mean that the episode should have absolutely ended with Picard and Data realizing that they love each other and running off together...

Regardless, this weirdly makes the earlier subtext of misappropriating New World cultures text, as Picard has chosen to "solve" this problem by casting himself as the center of a foreign mythology that he thinks that he can improvise.

## Conclusions

It seems like we get a lot, but I notice that they mostly fall into clean categories.

### The Bad

We see, once again, the excessive pressure placed on children, this time expecting absolute technical accuracy in their art.  Data, by contrast, doesn't seem to find accuracy as important.

The anti-intellectual trend also pervades the episode.  Data avoids representing music as a sculpture, and doesn't seem to recall the assorted times that something has taken control of his mind.  Riker seems to think that objects traveling for millions of years through space seems strange *and* finds it amazing that the thing found inside came first.  Troi thinks that masks come from some incredible feat of imagination, and doesn't seem to understand what people use aqueducts for.  Riker and Picard both dismiss the novel culture as backwards and set in its ways with no evidence beyond seeing a selection of artifacts, with Picard choosing to center himself in their mythology.  They also all seem to think of suns and moons as mutually exclusive opposites.

Riker apparently also leaves gifts for his exes, despite rejection of picking their relationship back up.

Picard also repeatedly dismisses the authority of presumed sovereign governments, who happen to not have physical forms.  He repeatedly refers to "accessing" or "controlling" the head of state to get what he wants, nothing more than a means to an end.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Troi plays paranormal detective in *Eye of the Beholder*.
