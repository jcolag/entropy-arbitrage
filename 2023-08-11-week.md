As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

If you don't catch the subtext, here, this means that we've almost certainly had almost *everything* wrong about the place.

 > HeLa cells went on to become a cornerstone of modern medicine, enabling countless scientific and medical innovations, including the development of the polio vaccine, genetic mapping and even COVID-19 vaccines.

Hashtags:  #MedicalRacism #HeLa

This arguably understates both the importance of the cells---I believe that *I* have worked with HeLa cells, despite not working in medicine or (usually) biology---and the ethical gymnastics that people attempt to explain why they don't want people digging up corpses or auctioning off organs, but the cells constitute commercial property that some family with associated DNA shouldn't try to control.

## 6:32 PM -- Wed 09 August 2023

[Answered on Cohost](https://cohost.org/jcolag/post/2430067-confused-that-the-fo)

Someone asked for my thoughts on the [Rust programming language](), so I did what I could.

 > Good question!  I don't know that this answer will end up as *useful* to anybody, whatever that might mean for a particular person, but in broad strokes, I'd call myself a fan.
 >
 > Because I started my career writing C, I make my comparisons from there, and Rust looks a lot like what I wish C had grown into - especially the memory model - instead of always reifying old ideas of what makes "good" code and leaving the future to someone else.  I contrast that assessment with how I feel about Go, which seems like a decent enough language, but feels so much like a response to specifically 1980s academic criticisms of C ("you can read declarations aloud, left-to-right," for instance) that it feels like the language came out thirty years too late.
 >
 > More to the point, for my personal projects, the few projects that (had I worked on them fifteen years ago) I would have written in C, I now reach for Rust.  I still don't know it well enough to write it off the cuff like I do with languages that I use or have used every day.  But a couple of years back, I wrote the back-end of a local search engine (local, as in "for specific files on my computer, like notes") in Rust, and it only took about a thousand lines and a few hours to handle the indexing, searching, and network code to spin up a server.
 >
 > I wish that Rust had a more complete object model and would ditch the macros, but I can mostly understand why they made those choices.
 >
 > My only "real" objection probably involves the culture around it, but I feel that way about most languages.  Because Rust basically gets ignored in all contexts but "read this list of some languages that we'll call up-and-coming" clickbait, many Rust developers seem to want to find opportunities to "convert" people, and that doesn't help.  I mean, they don't come off as bad as Python people (no offense to Python people, but wow, I sometimes feel like, even if I only write about starting a project in notes to myself that I won't ever publish, someone will still show up to ask if I've considered using Python for that...), and I get that the alternative of writing enormous projects in Rust takes far more effort than commenting online, but it still feels a bit embarrassing.

I keep meaning to do more work in Rust, honestly, but I'd *also* like to do more work in Haskell, find a reason to work in SmallTalk or APL, kick the tires on D and Zig, and find some languages that *actually* qualify as new...

Hashtags:  #MaryAnning #Paleontology

Even if you don't know Anning's name by now, you know her reputation, as (likely) the "she" who sells seashells by the sea shore, complete with the need to sell artifacts to fund her work *and* the societal minimizing of a successful career in archaeology due to her gender, all in eight words.  In other words, if you don't know her name, then you should do yourself a favor and read up about her.

Hashtags:  #ChildAbuse #RightWing #HomeSchool

I don't oppose home-schooling---beyond opposing pretty much all private schooling, I mean, because it takes money from public schools---but yes, we do have a clear need for making sure that the home will neither train children to become horrible adults *or* traumatize them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barbie-scaled.jpg|Barbie (the doll) staring blankly into the camera|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Sorry, But Barbie Is Still a Problem](https://otherwords.org/sorry-but-barbie-is-still-a-problem/) from OtherWords

 > The doll has always been tone-deaf. Soon after Barbie was launched, just as second-wave feminism emerged, Mattel released Slumber Party Barbie. This Barbie, Devika Sunand wrote, ‚Äúcame with pink pajamas, a pink scale set at 110 lbs, and a diet book on how to lose weight, with only one instruction: DON‚ÄôT EAT!‚Äù

I don't particularly care about the framing of this, because it implies that past traumas mean that the company can never fix the problem with the brand, but we do need to keep these problems in mind, and demand that toy companies always do better for the next generation.
