As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Anecdotally, I've definitely seen secular versions of this, where people who have some emotional bond to their job---needing it to stay in the country, having a prior relationship with their boss, thinking of their work as incredibly important, and so forth---have the same issues, where they don't even recognize problems.  In fact, I've known several managers who deliberately handed out important-sounding titles and cultivated personal relationships with certain workers, in hopes of keeping them from complaining.  (I didn't stay long at those jobs.)

Honestly, how insecure do you have to feel in your own gender and sexuality to want to control and shut down a Trans Pride parade...?

Alito seems to stand on the edge of a breakdown, probably because he sees Kavanaugh and Barrett ruling in fairly reasonable ways on cases instead of joining he and Thomas in their unvarnished authoritarian dissents.  And I admit that I wouldn't mind if he had to retire...

Again, it looks a lot like authoritarians really over-extended themselves, this time, with all their work in almost every country falling apart.  I suppose that I already expected this, because I told everybody that the "rise of fascism" actually looked more to me like cornered animals lashing out than actual power, but I didn't expect to see authoritarians in places as different as Guatemala and Russia fall apart at the same time that American conservatives tear each other apart.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

I see problems with this idea, like that you would need someone to *listen* to the detailed explanation, but it still seems worth filing away.

 > ...it was the intervention of Belarus President Lukashenko that brought about an end to the mutiny, not any words or actions from Putin.

Russia has never looked like it had a stable government, to me.  The collapse of the Soviet Union and sloppy attempt to change to a capitalist economy didn't help the image, and things have gotten progressively worse, until this week.  Now, Prigozhin has proven that a relatively small armed group can reach the Moscow city limits with no resistance, and Putin has shown that he will *flee*, when challenged.  Will neighbors try to snag some extra real estate that people used to consider theirs?  Will the Russian people seize the opportunity to protest?  We'll have to see.
