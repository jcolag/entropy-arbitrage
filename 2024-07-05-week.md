As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The idea that one can rebel forcefully by fighting for the right to choose whom to love is articulated in the godna song. As the singers grow comfortable, clapping and laughing, their tone becomes celebratory while mocking authority.

 > All over the country, teachers, students, and workers are avoiding states with harsh abortion restrictions. One survey found that 45 percent of young people were likely to reject a job offer if it meant working in a state where abortion was illegal.

To a certain extent, I have to appreciate how conservatives have constantly painted themselves as "the sleeping giant" for decades---pretending to speak for a silent and vast majority---and managed to wake an actual giant that doesn't like them at all, because *everybody* supports access to abortion except for the right-wing fringe that openly hates women...

I worry about this study *slightly*, because it relies on getting information from a system that has no trouble fabricating lies or completely ignoring the current conversation.  However, even the fact that it would claim bias at all and use stereotypes to support the decision---even if false---shows that the systems have no serious guards against bigotry.

 > In addition to hiding salary information, hiring agents tend to obscure the criteria they use to evaluate prospective employees. For example, they might announce that they are looking for applicants with strong communication or teamwork skills, but they don‚Äôt describe what meets those criteria.

Hashtags:  #Labor #College #Hiring

I feel like the interview's focus on salary transparency focuses on the wrong problem, here, but the overall problem resonates with me.  If you don't have anybody in your life who knows which companies treat people better, and how to get through the application process---and will share that experience with you---then you mostly take the first offer that anybody makes.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/content-id-fair-use.jpg|The YouTube logo changed to read FairUse|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Copyright takedowns are a cautionary tale that few are heeding](https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never) from Pluralistic

 > You might think that you can never quote a song lyric in a book without infringing copyright, or that you must clear every musical sample. You might be rock solid certain that scraping the web to train an AI is infringing. If you hold those beliefs, you do not understand the "fact intensive" nature of fair use.

This article helps explain something that I've said from the beginning, most notably in [*The Rise and (Likely) Fall of Anti-AI Licenses]({% post_url 2024-03-03-ai-licenses %}), that the problem has *nothing to do with AI*, and everything to do with enormous companies claiming everybody's work as their own.  But trying to attack OpenAI and their ilk with copyright won't harm them, while it *will* harm the student training their own AI for a project.
