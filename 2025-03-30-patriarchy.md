Pardon the lateness on this one, and any sloppiness from trying to pull this together quickly...

Like the other history-and-heritage months, I don't generally post much for Women's History Month, even though I often find myself thinking about gender roles.  And the latter part of that especially holds true this year, as we've had many---some might say far too many---displays of how masculinity and patriarchy work, here in the United States.

I have a reason for generally avoiding posts about this sort of thing, actually, despite its importance.  I'll talk about why later in the post, but for now, it'll do for me to say that I've come to see patriarchy as something like society's central problem, one that drives most other problems.

![A poster on a table, with a black upraised fist with a female-symbol at the bottom, saying to Make the Patriarchy Afraid](/blog/assets/51422454714_61177f23c1_o.png "Patriarchy starts out and eternally remains afraid, but still...")

As a quick note, this post will draw on material from many of my old Quora posts.  Generally, when I do this, I have a boilerplate introduction that identifies and links to the posts for those who want to see any original conversation, plus a disclaimer that I've updated and edited it.  This time through, I've dispensed with this, because it covers *so many* posts, because so many people over there asked maybe-sincere questions about where strict gender roles come from or why modesty governs so much of a (certain kind of; as in "female") person's character, and they all have the same approximate answer.

If somebody *really* wants me to sift through every time I wrote about patriarchy over there, ask, and I'll try to post a separate list of those answers...

## Recently

Before we get to the overview, let's take a look at a recent event that can probably bring a lot of what I'll say into focus:  That execrable [Trump/Zelenskyy meeting at the end of February <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript).  I know, it sounds weird, but I do have somewhere to go with this.

At around the time, I [commented on the unending footage of the event](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114095268427708263) on social media, pointing out that Trump's obsession with *respect* and *thanks* reflected how abuse often works, not to mention putting all the blame on the victim.  It especially echoes abuse in Trump's final "good television" comment, making it clear that his team planned the entire spectacle, knowing how it'd play out.

Since that toot, a third aspect to this crossed my mind that puts a lot into perspective for me:  The meeting revolved around toxic masculinity.

Oh, and I've since read John Biewen's---creator and host of the **Scene on Radio** podcast---earlier piece in his newsletter [*A Man Among Men* <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://buttondown.com/KeepingScOR/archive/keeping-scor-2-a-man-among-men/) (I subscribe via RSS) about people identifying Trump as "a man's man" and "a true gentleman," which touches on similar ideas.

## Defining Terms

I know.

> Oh, so because I identify as a man, that makes me *toxic*, John?

{% cite Every piece-of-trash man on the Internet %}

Absolutely.  Mentioning toxic masculinity declares you toxic in exactly the same way that the existence of toxic waste makes the discarded pizza box in your trash toxic.  It harms you in the same way that the existence of [toxic assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_asset) means that no assets have any value.  Heck, it probably means that in the same way that [toxic injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_injury) mean that stubbing your toe will probably kill you.

Oh, wait.  Those terms *don't* declare the attached nouns universally toxic?  Huh, weird.  Usually, adjectives indicate a more specific category of noun.  Maybe your imagined objection doesn't make sense, either.  Let's investigate, shall we?

[Toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity) actually revolves around destructive, anti-social behavior used to reinforce or enforce the expression of masculinity.  It looks like somebody edited it away, but the linked Wikipedia article once also described it as follows, if you want to dig into this page's history.

> ...a cultural perspective held by individuals which emphasizes the ideology and importance of men maintaining a dominant, aggressive, unemotional and sexually aggressive attitude, both collectively and as individuals.

By contrast, [masculine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/masculine) means pertaining or belonging to men.  Despite what we might believe, we use the term descriptively, rather than prescriptively.  Every man, by definition, does masculine things.  Every woman, by definition, does feminine things.  We can't do otherwise, because the terms follow, rather than lead, since gender roles always change all the time.

Do you see the difference?  Masculinity means the state of having properties of men.  *Toxic* masculinity means engaging in unpleasant behavior that you justify as somehow demanded by your naughty bits.

What kind of behavior?  I generally use a list like the following.

- Aggression
- Violence
- Paranoia
- Jealousy
- Obsession with sports
- Obsession with cars
- Acting like a slob when possible
- Always desperate for sex
- Emotionless, except for occasional anger
- Definitely no empathy
- As perpetually drunk as possible, largely to suppress the aforementioned emotions and empathy

I love to emphasize the last one, because it seriously bothers the people who can't (or won't) drink but strongly identify with this brand of masculinity.  And you know...I don't know what to tell you, there, other than to laugh at your expense.  You *don't* sit at the top of the hierarchy, the same as "manly" men who acknowledge their emotions or don't care about sports.  Toxic masculinity revolves entirely around the idea of a pecking order, based on the most inane things possible.  It has **toxic** in the name, you should realize, and making it part of your life makes your life worse.

Do you maybe find it unfair that some of these criteria have to do with culture, so that it prioritizes the majority of white men over the rest of the world?  Congratulations, you've started to figure out how these people see masculinity.

Likewise, when we talk about [patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy), we need to distinguish that from goofy mischaracterizations of the idea.  We don't mean that some shadowy cabal of men runs everything.  We also don't mean that men get whatever they want.  Parallel to white supremacy, patriarchy only means that, normalizing for other factors like race and income, men will receive more deference and respect than women.  It means that men have highly disproportionate representation in positions of authority.  In other words, we *can't* solve patriarchy by finding the right cave and kneeing a bunch of cloaked jerks in their crotches; we need to change society.

## Origins

Going back to Wikipedia's patriarchy article, you might notice that we have a fairly clear idea of how patriarchy and gender roles came together.  Early humans mostly lived in egalitarian groups in prehistory, probably as a natural result of operating as small nomadic communities focused primarily on survival, where you can't really afford to rule out anybody's contributions.

I've always thought of the key-phrase in the article as this bit.

> ...following social and technological developments such as agriculture and domestication.

Interestingly, it then tries to dismiss the idea that we have any idea how things changed, gesturing vaguely at the idea of private property, and skipping through the centuries until mentioning---almost in passing---laws in 3100 BCE on excluding women from "the process of representing or the construction of history," and early Judaism possibly excluding women from the covenant between them and their deity.

I call this interesting, because it shouldn't take much to read between the lines, here, even if we need to use fragmentary evidence from specific groups as a basis.  The mention of Judaism, in fact, feels like it requires mentioning one more detail that might help us figure this out:  The idea that people "inherit" Judaism through the matrilineal line.  Around the world, we have similar ideas to that, inheriting culture or identity from mothers, and it always comes down to the same issue of *possession*.

Let's read between those lines, then.  What mysterious change did our ancestors have, shortly after the advent of agriculture and domestication, which would lead people to insist that cultural identity derives from one's mother, and then start excluding women from culture, maybe having something to do with private property?  Unlike the weird conclusions that you'll see in the text about "climatic stress" and other ideas, it seems fairly clear that our ancestors mainly changed in that they shifted from living communally and nomadically to living in *households*.

One thing really changes when people live in a household instead of a clan or tribe.  They  change focus from the broader community to their immediate family.  And with that focus, the underlying reason for patriarchal structures stems from *jealousy*, specifically men's irrational distrust of wives and refusal to care for children not biologically related to them.

Again, I know.  A bunch of you have your hands up waiting to tell me that this makes sense, because *you* certainly wouldn't want the responsibility for raising children if you didn't father them.  Or maybe you want to tell me about spreading genes, largely reinventing [social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism).  And...you hear yourself, right?  You actively don't want to care about people unless you can scientifically prove their connection to you, and think that complete lack of empathy should drive society.  In other words, you made my case for me.

Anyway, at that point, we could have gone two ways.  Down one path, we could have told the jealous jackasses to grow up and take care of the kids in their households instead of trying to weasel out of acting like a good person, because you'll probably love the people you live with, anyway.  Down the other path, we could have passed laws and enacted social structures restricting who a woman could have sex with, either directly or indirectly.

We inanely chose the latter.  And once you have that one decision, society rests on a slippery slope.  Every generation can point to that decision as an excuse to further restrict women's movements, and every generation assumes that we *must* have inherited those laws and customs for legitimate reasons, because we generally can't imagine our ancestors acting insanely jealous and aggressively unfair, even though we see it in most of the stories that they passed down to us, too.

By the way, you might notice that this history doesn't contain any appeals to ill-defined biology.  The archaeological record doesn't show evidence of hand-waving about correlations between genitals and upper-body strength.  The record doesn't show evidence of hand-wringing about PMS or biological clocks.  No, those came much later, to *justify* the choice to segregate women to future generations who might start to realize that this all looks like abuse rather than a proper way to organize a society.

### Later

Fast-forwarding through history, we've tried to fix a lot of this, especially over the last couple of centuries.  In most of the world, women can get an education, vote, participate in public activities, own property, have careers, and so forth.  And around every milestone, most men and some women have shown up to remind us of...I guess that I can claim the rule as my own, since I've never seen anybody else express it, so they show up to remind us of my rule of social progress.

> Successful social movements from before your political awareness feel correct and just.  All social movements starting with your political awareness feel scary, and they probably **go too far**.

You get some outliers on both sides of that rule, as you well know.  We have plenty of people who look at modern feminism and fully approve of the fights for [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), safe spaces, reproductive health, and a desire for social equality.  And we have plenty of creeps comfortable asking whether women *really* need to vote and own property.

Like any news story on human rights, we have the standard "we've come a long way, but still have a long way to go" coda.

### Digression on Feminism

By the way, since I used the word "milestone," in the spirit of full disclosure, I should probably note that I deviate sharply from traditional feminist thinking in the view of progress.  Most feminist writers like to talk about "waves" of feminism.  First-wave feminism, they insist, fought for the right to vote.  Second-wave feminism fought for legal equality, third-wave social equality, and fourth-wave...the same as third-wave, but "on the Internet."

I *hate* this model.  It imagines that [Elizabeth Cady Stanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton) (for example) wouldn't have wanted people to treat her with the same respect that her male peers received.  It imagines that *nothing happened* between the big milestones.  Also, it imagines that feminists don't really exist outside the English-speaking world, ignoring places where human rights have progressed at different rates and in different directions.   And don't get me started on the "fourth-wave looks like third-wave except Instagram" weirdness.

If you use the wave model, don't see this as a rebuke, only my disclaimer for why it might feel like I want to avoid the topic.

### Digression on Secondary Effects

As I mentioned above, I often consider patriarchy and its sexism as one of society's only "real" problems, many of the rest there to either existing to support patriarchy or supported by it.

For example, white supremacy gets its fuel from patriarchy as described above.  Why don't we want "those people" in our country?  Bigotry would have us know that they might impregnate our women.  Sometimes, we dance around this with eugenicist talk about birth-rates, as we do today.  But in some cases, we make that idea explicit, like lynchings in the United States driven almost entirely through concerns that a Black man might attract a white woman.  This dynamic continues today, with some of us maybe having a long enough memory to remember almost five whole years ago, when a [white woman called the police on a Black bird-watcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_birdwatching_incident) because he asked her to leash her dog, which she reported as threatening.  And honestly, race itself only really exists---another social construct---because Europeans needed some way of justifying colonizing parts of the world that already had functioning societies.

The same goes for religious conflicts, and many others, as many of you probably know better than I do.

Likewise, we see homophobia and transphobia, even objections to drag shows on non-feminist grounds[^1], because they transgress against gender roles.  How can you enforce the idea that men should sexually pursue all women to make them feel uncomfortable, if you can't identify the women to hurt?  How can you insist that men should have all the power, if we admit that we might have misidentified some women as men and raised them in ways that hurt them?  And how can you enforce gender roles in families, if some parenting pairs have the same gender?

[^1]:  I generally find drag shows uncomfortable, as do a lot of people I know, because so many of the personas revolve around misogynistic stereotypes.  And sometimes, you'll find a prominent performer talking about how he got into it because he saw the power that women had on stage and wanted that power for himself, which feels almost absurdly patriarchal and not at all transgressive...

Without patriarchy, none of these other bigotries work.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't also fight them, because we should, but rather that we should see patriarchy as one of the primary targets in those fights.

Based on this, I felt sorely tempted to title the post *Original Sin*, riffing on the Abrahamic story of [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve), which suggests that all human suffering exists because a woman dared to learn about things.  In fact, the sin seems far more rooted in worrying about what women might learn...

## Gender Roles

Regardless of the progress made on breaking up patriarchal systems, we all feel immediate consequences of patriarchy, some of which I've already talked about at the start.  Specifically, we feel those consequences in the form of gender roles.

Like many people, I call gender a *social construct*, meaning a classification based on convention and collective agreement.  It might sound like I mean that it doesn't matter, but plenty of things fall into the social construct category, like countries, money, language, religion, private property, modesty, and so forth.  Those things all matter so much that, if you fall on the wrong side of one, it might destroy your life in many contexts.  But they contrast with natural categories in that we can and do change them over time, either because tastes change or we explicitly decide to change.

For one of my favorite examples of gender as a social construct, look at "professionals."  Watch the television news, politicians, and non-billionaire business executives.  What do you see most quickly?  You probably see that men almost all dress near-identically, with a suit in one of three colors---black, gray, or navy blue---with a white shirt and a tie that also usually doesn't deviate much.  Women, by contrast, wear a variety of clothes in a wide variety of colors.  Beyond the professional world, you'll find most men wearing jeans and a t-shirt, with women again wearing a wide variety of clothing including jeans and t-shirts.  Gender roles seem fairly clear that men have a severely restricted wardrobe, and I ask...why?

Does this come from some natural order where women have a biological need to show themselves?  Nope.  It comes from the [Great Male Renunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Male_Renunciation) during and in the aftermath of the [Atlantic Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions).  As a visual move towards democratic ideals, wealthy men discarded their wigs, high heels, stockings, and bright colors, deriding them as aristocratic and *effeminate*.  Men in the twentieth century counterculture briefly pushed back against this in the [peacock revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_revolution), but that only really had a lasting effect on performance arts.

When I talk about gender as a social construct, I mean issues like this.  Men decide that bland clothing makes them feel important, therefore all men must dress that way.  And because all men dress that way, we dismiss color and frill as frivolous and push it on women.  Further, we all treat it as some eternal law, even though it changed, from the equivalent of a marketing campaign, over the course of a couple of decades.  And while it didn't last, it only took a few popular bands dressing different to convince a generation of kids to change it again.

If it works for something as universal-seeming as clothing, why would you ever think that other aspects of masculinity have some deeper origin or purpose?

### Hegemony

This brings me to one of the big terminology issues that never fails to annoy me.

If you didn't like the term *toxic masculinity* above, we have another term that largely means the same thing, [hegemonic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity), and I've found that many people familiar with both use them interchangeably.  I consider the term better in many ways, but it defeats the purpose of using it, in that probably less than one in a thousand people can define or identify a hegemony, making it utterly useless.

What, then, do we mean by hegemony?  We mean dominance or authority over others with some level of consent from the subordinates.  Note that *consent* doesn't necessarily mean complete or enthusiastic agreement.  Consent often means seeing no alternative.  From a global politics perspective, at least before Project 2025 came to the Oval Office, you could argue (and many have argued) that the United States had a cultural, political, and military hegemony over at least most of the world, for example, for various reasons (almost) none of which involve non-American populations begging us for more action movies or military bases.

Similarly, hegemonic masculinity hands us this gender role filled with toxicity---the suppression of emotions, the propensity for violence, the bland clothing, and so forth---and makes us complicit in enforcing it.  In exchange for accepting dominance hierarchies, the idea goes, we have a chance of imposing dominance on somebody else.  That "else" might include other men with less power, but it might also include people representing racial, religious, gender, or sexual minorities.  That might help explain why patriarchy always finds itself enmeshed in white supremacy or equivalent ideas, or why ambulatory garbage like Dominique Pelicot could find dozens of like-minded customers willing to assault [his wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gis%C3%A8le_Pelicot) while drugged unconscious.

## Back to the Top

That brings us full-circle, I think.  While Trump and Vance staged their inane meeting with the purpose of publicly abusing a fellow world leader, we can now see a likely purpose behind it.  Hegemonic or toxic masculinity demands that we buy into the role by forcing ourselves onto somebody else, and trying to coerce their consent.  And likewise, notice how quickly those two become subservient when somebody with more power focuses on them, whether we mean tech-billionaires, successful foreign autocrats---one of which had a large stake in the outcome of that same meeting---or anybody who challenges them.  They might rage about it on social media and right-wing news after the fact, but they back down every time somebody with more power in some sense confronts them.

Many people have surely said it before me, but toxic/hegemonic masculinity means that you don't have personal relationships, only transactional power dynamics.

And that also helps explain so much of the administration's direction.  They want to gut "soft power" organizations---[USAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development), the [Kennedy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts), and so forth, not to mention dismantling political alliances---because the idea of convincing people to think better of you and to *trust* you makes no sense to them, in their world of hoping to become the alpha male[^2] through transactional plays for dominance.  They want to return to segregation on racial and health grounds, because men who think like them and who have no power need to feel like they can dominate *somebody*.  They want to restrict women's autonomy, because they can't convince you to associate masculinity with power if women feel empowered, too.  And they want transgender folks out of sports as a pretext to police gender roles, and to make sure that nobody notices that an awful lot of women can outperform an awful lot of men, regardless of broad statistics; if successful, they'll probably follow this with trying to shut down women's sports altogether.

[^2]:  It occurs to me that the alpha male idea actually works really well here, both as a largely debunked nonsense idea from flawed studies reflecting their anti-science positions, but in the specific flaws of the study, where the wolf pack studied lived in captivity with few resources.  And really, what better model could we have for gender roles than a dominance hierarchy enforced by the idea that you can never escape and/or that somebody will steal whatever you have if you fail to participate?

They feel weak, and they fear everything, so they need to push everybody else down to claim their titles of dominance, even if only locally.  As I mentioned above, we can't dismantle patriarchy by kneeing some creeps in the groin, but to the loudest proponents of patriarchy[^3], it feels like that.

[^3]:  As a parting shot, I'd like to remind everybody that [The loudest monkeys have the smallest balls <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://qz.com/531496/the-loudest-monkeys-have-the-smallest-balls)...

And maybe most importantly, while we have too few models in culture to help guide us, we can mostly walk away from the hegemony, becoming far more powerful than any of the "alpha" dolts.
