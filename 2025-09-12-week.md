As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Looking more broadly at the effect of unions on nonunion pay, the effect goes up, with the decline in union membership explaining a third of the total increase in wage inequality for men. For women, declining individual union membership doesn’t increase wage inequality, but the link between union strength and nonunion wages accounts for a fifth of the rise in inequality.

This goes in the pile with other things that we probably all knew---that inequality comes from sexism, a lack of organized labor, and education---but that we should appreciate having numbers to put to it in discussions.

I have to admit that I've never seen anything like this before, real or imagined, where we have something *this* destructive, this ineffective at any valuable and difficult tasks, and this expensive...but everybody in authority keeps pushing it as the next big thing that everybody should use, as if they can wish it into being.

Hashtags:  #NaturalDisasters #Stories #Help

I remember watching all this unfold from the news, and even in a predominantly conservative group, nobody found it credible except for people who wanted an excuse to not extend help.  Ironic, given events over the past couple of weeks of the Federal government invading United States cities, but one of the first things that we noticed was how the situation seemed all but designed for mobilizing the military to get aid in and needy people out.  But instead, the media and politicians wanted to talk about looters, as if a big-box store's insurance premiums count more than lives.

Hashtags:  #Democracy #Juries #Arbitration

I don't know that I have enough material for a full blog post, but for many years, I've had serious concerns about corporate over-reach and how much of it looks like they use the United States Bill of Rights as a guide.  Non-disparagement agreements, non-disclosure agreements, deleting media off your devices over licensing issues, demanding that you not defend yourself from digital attacks, smuggling spyware onto your computers, putting up surveillance systems everywhere, handing over your data without consent to whoever requests it, arbitration agreements, banning people without recourse or charging high fees, using a lack of legal protection as a loophole to harm, and so forth, feel like they literally go down the list of Constitutional amendments in this country, to see what they want to do next...

All true, including (especially?) the "crass commercialism" part, which mortifies me.  I even put up a skeletal [store page](https://john.colagioia.net/store/) on my website.

Long-time readers know about the novel from [one of my first posts]({% post_url 2019-12-14-seeking-refuge %}), and you can snag the [first edition](https://archive.org/details/seekingrefuge) from the Internet Archive, weird typos, incomprehensible pseudo-foreign dialogue, and more that I cleaned and fixed this time around.

I'll officially keep the book pay-walled for *no more than* six months, maybe less, though if purchasers want to share it, I can't and wouldn't stop them.  If you'd rather wait, then mark your calendar for 2026 March 11.  I'll try to remember to announce it on the blog (here!) when I do it, as well.  If you can't wait, can't afford the three (US) dollars, and can't live with the first edition, especially if we know each other, then reach out.

Also, expect a full post either this Sunday or next, going through the experience of revisiting and revising the book.

It wouldn't surprise me if this sudden interest in everybody's age actually stemmed from a fear of a new crop of companies that might actually knock some billionaires off their pedestals.  For the first time in a while, we have people flocking to smaller platforms and preferring it to the constant cycles of abuse and exploitation.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

As always, take care of yourselves.

 > The group highlighted the [suspension of Elon Musk’s X](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2024/09/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-x-formerly-twitter-situation-in-brazil/), ordered by the Supreme Court (STF) in August 2024 for refusing to name a legal representative in Brazil, as well as the [USD 5 million fine](https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-top-court-orders-x-pay-14-million-2025-02-20/) that the company had to pay.

If you wondered why billionaire tech executives all dumped money into Trump's "library" slush-fund and showed up to kowtow at his inauguration, that pays dividends.

This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.”

Speaking of warmongering on behalf of corporations...

 > Ironically, one of the things the right hates most about Wikipedia is that it takes affirmative measures to identify and correct its bias, for example, by actively encouraging editorial participation by members of minorities who are underrepresented in Wikipedia's volunteer editor cohort. Right wing demagogues call this "DEI," even as they demand that the government force Wikipedia to institute DEI for conspiracy-addled right wing trolls. As the saying goes, "When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression."

I often find myself pointing out how much people take Wikipedia for granted---often trying to cast them as antagonists, somehow, to the Internet Archive as it contrives to alienate yet more creators so that they can beg for money to defend against the lawsuits---but it doesn't become less true...
