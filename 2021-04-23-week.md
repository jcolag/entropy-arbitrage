As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1384130158538395649) [Maybe America Is Racist](https://www.theroot.com/maybe-america-is-racist-1846667213) from The Root

 >  Scientists...accept the premise that whenever there are two different possibilities, the simpler one is usually the correct one.

A big problem---which I assume that Harriot understands but didn't want to bog down an excellent article with it---is that it takes courage for a privileged person to process our bigoted complicity in a system.  So, you'll often see right-wingers insist that a criticized action or statement *can't* be racist, because a person they respect does or says it, and *that* person isn't racist.

So, you can see how we might get from there to insisting that every hate crime, every police execution of a Black man, and every under-funded school is just another coincidence.  It's why activists have started making the distinction between "non-racist" (an identity where you can pat yourself on the back) and "anti-racist" (actively challenging yourself and systems), and why racists always complain about being "made" to feel [white guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_guilt).

 > Beyond today's marketing strategies, the tobacco industry's intricate ties to slavery and colonizer violence runs deep.

It is definitely "interesting" to see cigarette companies try to horn in on Black Lives Matter messaging, knowing full well that their market exists due to slave plantations *and* that they spent decades targeting advertising at Black neighborhoods.

I was exposed to this mindset a lot back when I spent time on [Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}), often used as an attempt to deny misogyny by asserting that treating women equally would actually be bad, because people (read "men") need women to do all the things that stereotypical men don't find interesting.

 > Their new archaeological work shows that the ground surface on which the mound was constructed remained stable until industrial development.

[Cahokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahokia) is a site that just never stops being surprising.  It's a thousand years old near St. Louis, and may have hit twenty thousand residents at times, making it one of the largest cities in the world at the time.  But it was basically invisible to settlers, because a lot of it was built in and around pyramidal mounds that mostly now just look like hills.

 > Furthermore, Bezos claims that this micro-level algorithmic management of worker's bodies will be “central” to the company's strategy going forward.

You know all of those snide comments that people make about the dystopian nature of people allowing their lives to be controlled by clocks and calendars, especially in the context of smart-phones?  This is going to make that look like a playground game, literally rushing people around because a mathematical model says that a worker's back muscles will have recovered sufficiently from lifting the last heavy thing and so shouldn't go to waste.  People are going to get hurt, because a billionaire can't just treat employees like humans.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Inspiring new generations of Balinese language speakers through superheroes and wikis](https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/17/inspiring-new-generations-of-balinese-language-speakers-through-superheroes-and-wikis/) from Global Voices

 > The character is “a courageous, agile, fast and strong Indonesian superhero who uses her powers to help sustain the natural and cultural environment of Indonesia.”

The [actual book](https://reader.letsreadasia.org/book/3bbf155d-101d-4cb0-b46d-34699b303b26?mId=3bbf155d-101d-4cb0-b46d-34699b303b26&lId=5757156540284928) is licensed non-commercial, otherwise I'd cover it for the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/bookclub).
