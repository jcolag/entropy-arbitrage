As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > These young activists are part of the ‚ÄúSpring Revolution,‚Äù the name of the global resistance against the military regime which rose to power in Myanmar through a coup in February 2021.

Hashtags:  #Myanmar

This could grow more interesting fairly quickly, you might notice.  On one side, having a voice from the United States potentially provides access to greater resources, but---as we see it playing out in the active wars around the world---many see connections to a major power like the United States in colonial terms.

 > In practice, Google uses a variety of anticompetitive tricks to prevent these app stores from springing up and to dissuade Android users from sideloading.

Hashtags:  #Google #Antitrust

This has the potential to open a lot of "platforms," if we take the right angle on things.  If Epic convinces the judge to force Google to open Android's ecosystem, then this gives other companies to take another run at Apple to open theirs.  Then, we could have Amazon's various marketplaces in someone's sights, and *maybe* even corporate social media.  All of those platforms try to lock users in, stifle competition, and block attempts at interoperability, almost precisely the argument that Epic used.

 > President Shawn Fain rallied their members over social media, reminding them they weren‚Äôt trying to wreck the economy, but to wreck ‚Äútheir‚Äù economy ‚Äî the economy of the Big Three and Wall Street.

Hashtags:  #Labor

The article doesn't get into this, for some reason, but you might notice the theme that people have started to realize that the wealthy divide us so that we can't find their unified front.  And even the media can't avoid talking about it anymore, in reports on how---despite political polarization---almost everybody agrees on most issues, with abortion standing as the prime example.

And, as a reminder, only a couple of weeks ago, Futurity summarized a study showing that [Air pollution can take a toll on kids‚Äô test scores](https://www.futurity.org/air-pollution-test-scores-3000462/), which I mentioned in [that week's batch of toots]({% post_url 2023-12-01-week %}).

Combined with the Thursday article, this reminds me of the Tom Lehrer song [*Pollution*](https://tomlehrersongs.com/pollution/).

 > The city streets are really quite a thrill,

 > If the hoods don't get you, the monoxide will.

We have metaphorical hoods, in this case, and they metaphorically wear *white* hoods, but it still tracks, sadly.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://images.dailykos.com/images/1256043/story_image/DorranceDanceNutcracker.jpg|A still image the Dorrance Dance Nutcracker performance|false|probably public domain as published by the United States government %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Conservatives freak out about Jill Biden's White House tap-dancing Christmas video](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/12/15/2211926/-Conservatives-freak-out-about-Jill-Biden-s-White-House-tap-dancing-Christmas-video) from Daily Kos

 > Fox News reported that the Dorrance Dance troupe is in favor of police reform and ‚Äúprison abolition.‚Äù This is the conservative equivalent of telling Captain Ahab that Moby Dick was spotted on the internets. Insecure men's rights narcissist Andrew Tate wrote, ‚ÄúThis is dystopian. If I believed in fear - I would be afraid.‚Äù He sort of sounds afraid of tap dancing?

One day, I'll stop laughing hysterically long enough to comment on the article and situation.  While I try to control myself, you go rewatch the video.

 > Consistent with the idea that sunlight plays a key role, SAD tends to be more common in more northern regions of the world, like Scandinavia and Alaska, where the days are shortest and the winters longest.

I hope that this serves as a reminder to take care of yourself, as we (in the Northern Hemisphere) get less Sun.  For the first time in my life, I can feel the difference.
