As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > But we can’t think of the pre-pandemic prevalence of domestic violence as a tolerable "normal" to aim towards.

A related point is the "some people aren't safe at home" articles, which also miss the point that you don't necessarily need to shelter-in-place in *your* home.  It's not out of the question to find a friend with an "emergency" and be too worried about infecting your household to return...while you decide where to go after the pandemic eases.

 > But since no study has taken place on widespread, long-term building closures, knowledge gaps remain on how to best maintain stable water quality during a shutdown.

This is just a guess on my part, but everyone will probably want to be *especially* careful in smaller, suburban offices, especially the sorts of areas that used to be residential or are part of a downtown area.  Those have different needs than the skyscrapers and generally only have a maintenance staff of one part-timer.

It should go without saying, but if you're somehow looking to *me* for medical advice, when you need a doctor, **call your doctor**.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How (Not) To Report On Russian Disinformation](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2020/04/15/how-not-to-report-on-russian-disinformation/) from Bellingcat

 > Many countries, just like Russia, pay (either directly or via friendly organizations/firms) actual humans to run accounts that promote a certain viewpoint or else are jerks to other people on social media.

A big part of the problem is that there's a section of the media that's exclusively representing corporate interests and wants to see Russians around every corner to avoid offending any domestic viewers, *but* there's also another significant segment of the media that's driven by an entirely contrary ideology that wants to pretend that any mention of Russia must be trying to deflect blame from whoever they feel like blaming.

They're there.  They're not at the root of every problem, but they're making existing problems worse.
