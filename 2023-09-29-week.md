As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

It seems so much less complicated to help people *without* further victimizing them.  But I suppose that, when you set up a literal [white savior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior) narrative, everybody else in the story gets demoted to supporting cast or extras.

To everybody who I've confidently told, over the years, that we haven't gone back to the Moon because it has nothing interesting there for us to do...I suppose that I owe you an apology.  I didn't expect sulfur to show up anywhere in this context.

Hashtags:  #WhiteSupremacy #ActiveClubs

Note the undercurrent, here, especially if you lean towards white supremacy and not away from it:  These creeps prey on the insecurities of young men, making them feel like they can become strong, but with the explicit intent of sending them into danger as cannon fodder.

They've dropped the pretense of even talking about legitimate social issues---and ignoring the underlying reasons for those social issues---as the "bait" for young men.  They've settled on body-shaming, like every other unimaginative bully, and would only prefer that their Nazi-worship to not feel so "obvious."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-145-800x450.png|Screenshot from YouTube video, ‚ÄôZimbabweans Living in South Africa Protest Election Outcome‚Äò on VOA Africa|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Zimbabwe election aftermath sees human rights defenders and opposition supporters under siege](https://globalvoices.org/2023/09/20/zimbabwe-election-aftermath-sees-human-rights-defenders-and-opposition-supporters-under-siege/) from Global Voices

 > However, just 72 hours following an underwhelming inauguration on September 4, attended by only a few heads of state, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission contentiously declared Mnangagwa the winner over Chamisa of the newly named Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC). Soon after, reports of violence against human rights defenders, lawyers, and opposition supporters began surfacing in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital.

Good luck to the people of Zimbabwe.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [On International Peace Day Women‚Äôs Critical Role Highlighted](https://www.voanews.com/a/on-international-peace-day-women-s-critical-role-highlighted-/7279328.html) from Voice of America

In all fairness, I'd rather focus on society's need to *dump* the peace-making roles on women, but I can settle for recognition.
