As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Despite some very minor reforms to its voting and decision-making over the past 80 years, the IMF continues to serve these same interests, giving almost no voice to countries that subsequently achieved independence.

They have at least a complete overhaul for *decades*, responsible for privatization and austerity policies that nearly drove many countries to bankruptcy.  Beyond their colonial nature, they also seem to get everything wrong, as if they fell out of some sort of right-wing casting call...

I need to start referring to the sort of corporate-colonized pseudo-journalism as "press opera," since much like soap operas, they only exist to keep people anxious enough by amplifying the emotional content so that the audience will accidentally sit through the commercials...

 > Carbon credits produce the most perverse outcomes imaginable. For example, much of Tesla's profitability has been derived from the sale of carbon credits to the manufacturers of the dirtiest, most polluting SUVs on Earth; without those Tesla credits, those SUVs would have been too expensive to sell, and would not have existed.

The article goes in some weird directions, but I suspect that readers here will appreciate the majority of it.

 > Homeless service providers often tout their effectiveness in terms of meals served, beds provided or classes offered, research has shown. However, none of these measurements reflect success in terms of reducing homelessness.

As always, whatever you measure, you'll end up optimizing for, even if that has nothing to do with your goals.

Given how many of my run-ins with AI end with me cursing at the computer for its complete disinterest in following any directions, I have to agree.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/StPro3-1-1200x675.jpeg|Protesting students in Dhaka|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Freedom of assembly and freedom of expression curtailed as deadly student protests rock Bangladesh](https://globalvoices.org/2024/07/25/freedom-of-assembly-and-freedom-of-expression-curtailed-as-deadly-student-protests-rock-bangladesh/#) from Global Voices

 > For five days, the government issued a complete internet blackout, spurring misinformation and questions about what was happening in Bangladesh.

Well, that would certainly explain why I hadn't heard anything about the protests until reading this...though I admit that the media has found itself somewhat preoccupied over the last couple of weeks.

I feel like, if the legitimate-sounding story of Vance having sex with a sofa proves out, that might quickly become the most likeable thing about the creep...
