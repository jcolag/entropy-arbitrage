As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Today, around 20.6 million Americans live in a mobile or manufactured home. About one-third of mobile homes are located in mobile home communities.

Do private equity funds do *anything* useful, or do they only strip functioning companies for parts?

 > While this shows that there may be a displacement effect, this does not show that but-for public programs, private charity will cover the costs of poverty. And in fact, the historical record shows otherwise: until the 1940s, the United States’ poverty rate typically hovered well above 50 percent.

Hashtags:  #SNAPFreeze #USPol #Charity #Welfare

If only we had some single large-scale charity system, where we all paid into it based on our incomes, and that then funded an organization to disburse those funds to people in need.  Oh, right...

 > States that implemented this austerity experienced greater private-sector job losses — and economic recovery lagged significantly behind states that expanded spending during the Great Recession.

Hashtags:  #Recession #USPol

Something not mentioned in this article, one of the hardest crashes came in the United Kingdom, where we later learned that the report that the government used to guide their austerity decision itself fouled its analysis by [misusing their spreadsheet](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646).  It never works, unless by "work," you mean that it provides the opportunity for large companies to abuse the community.

 > Pandemics thrive where inequity does. When those at the margins cannot protect themselves, outbreaks become pandemics, and these pandemics last longer. We have seen HIV continue to devastate LGBTQ communities, particularly where stigma and criminalization persist.

Hashtags:  #Health #Pandemics

We really need to stop putting people in charge of things who believe that we need to usher in the end of the world so that they can get their eternal reward.  It *might* represent a conflict of interest.

You all know by now that I place a high value on a good night's sleep.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > A few days later, ARC replied. “Yes, we can confirm that not selling your data includes not selling to any third party, including, but not limited to, any government agency as part of ARC’s Travel Intelligence Program,” the company said.

Granted, at the moment, it doesn't look like many people will fly in the near future, but for those of you who do and have *any* reason for concern, you have an option.
