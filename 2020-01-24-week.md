As [promised (or threatened)]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is the weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1219621670245171205) [Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig Sues New York Times for Describing What He Said](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmbx5/harvard-professor-lawrence-lessig-sues-new-york-times-for-describing-what-he-said) from VICE

 > What you won't find is a clear basis for the lawsuit.

(A shame - Lessig always seemed more principled than this nonsense.)

Not mentioned in the tweet for space reasons:  I can *empathize* with Lessig for being (sort of) taken out of context, certainly.

However, suing and claiming that his (honestly, fairly minimal) reputation is being destroyed because he's being called out on things he literally said repeatedly despite an occasional disclaimer is going a bit far.  That's *especially* true when he has worked closely with [Joi Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito), who indeed accepted significant donations from Epstein.  And then trying to give the lawsuit a catchy brand name is *completely* irrational.
