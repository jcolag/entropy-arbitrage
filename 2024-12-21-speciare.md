This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Speciare Lunar Research Facility**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Speciare Lunar Research Facility**
 * Location:  <https://float-oat.itch.io/speciare-lunar-research-facility>
 * Released:  2019
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  [Thomas Nakagawa](https://thomasnakagawa.com/)
 * Medium:  Adventure game
 * Length:  Approximately thirty minutes, less if you see what to do immediately
 * Content Advisories:  Reported mass death, an ethical issue

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Speciare Lunar Research Facility

The game's page describes the experience as follows.

 > Introducing Speciare Lunar Research Facility! It's a brand new, high-tech moon laboratory. Opening in 2081, it will be the leading research center for space medicine and extraterrestrial science for years to come. 
 >
 > Controls:
 >
 > Use mouse to point and click to move, interact and use items.
 >
 > Open your inventory by clicking the Inventory button on the bottom left of the screen.
 >
 > Credits:

 > Game created by [float\_oat](https://float-oat.itch.io/)

The GitHub repository adds this more concise but relevant note.

 > A point-and-click adventure about searching for long-lost medical cures in an abandoned space laboratory.

It has other credits, but that should do for now.

## What Works Well?

The animation of our protagonist makes me far giddier than it probably should.  It tries to simulate low-gravity, but also moves at a high enough speed that it looks both realistic and incredibly silly.

Likewise, assuming that the game only has one ending, I got a good laugh out of it, despite the implications for everybody back home.

Finally, as you might have guessed, the game moves fairly quickly.  A more clever player could probably finish in whatever passes for a "coffee break," these days.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The game really only has two puzzles, and I feel like both could use better sign-posting than relying on the sparseness of the game to ensure that players will try everything.  And, I mean, I'd *expect* that from a game developed for a Game Jam like this, so don't let that scare you away from trying it out.  But if---under the terms of the license---somebody wanted to build on the base of the game, I'd recommend starting there...

## Opportunities

As usual for games, you can leave (supportive) comments on the Itch page, and while [the game's repository](https://github.com/thomasnakagawa/Speciare-Lunar-Research-Facility) hasn't seen any action in five years, the developer does seem active.

## What's Adaptable?

While the game text doesn't seem to ever name Speciare, we spend all our time in and around it.  In-game notes give us a rough history of the place from 2070 to the game's "present day" of presumably 2135.  Through their IDs, we also know that Andrea Ramona and Ramir Riane...or I have the naming order mixed up, because I'd expect the computer to show the family names first.  We've gotten far less information on settings from a lot of projects...

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read the adult-oriented **Trans Girl Project**.  I don't actually understand how long the comic runs---I see hundreds of pages available, but they could include translations and other material, for all I know---so I'll pare this down to pages definitely in there by limiting the reading to the story arcs set aside in galleries.  Therefore, we'll split the reading into two weeks.  Next time, we'll talk about *The Dream* and the first half of *The Tea*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
