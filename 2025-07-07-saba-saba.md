Today, (primarily) Kenyans celebrate [Saba Saba Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba_Saba_Day), remembering the 1990 demonstrations in favor of free and fair elections.  In the thirty-five years since, it has become more of a day to fight for human rights more generally, which has threatened the authorities enough for them to occasionally respond with force.

Over in Tanzania, the same name and date celebrate a seemingly less-interesting trade fair.

Anyway, on to the week's projects.

## Argh, Part 3

Should I have numbered installments of projects all along?  Should I do it going forward with real projects?  Hit me up with opinions...

During the week, I made some progress on getting things back to normal, or even improving on the status quo, though maybe not enough for my tastes.

### Mini-Server

First, as mentioned, I finally set up an old (pre-cop-friendly) Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+) as a home server.  [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), I needed soonest, and so started there.  To minimize the chances of backup failures in the future, [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) followed close behind.  And in-house git hosting got me thinking that I don't want to run an IDE on this lousy machine, so the Pi also runs [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server), a version of Visual Studio Code running in a browser; I wanted the more sophisticated [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for that, but they don't really support my use-case of self-hosting without Docker anymore.

And when code-server worked so well, I realized that I could probably offload e-mail, too---whether heavy web-mail pages or my preferred desktop applications---and installed [Snappy Mail](https://snappymail.eu/), as well[^1] [^2].  Those four services run behind [NGINX](https://nginx.org/), so that I don't need to remember port numbers.

[^1]:  I didn't find it clear enough in documentation anywhere, so I'll explain here.  On the surface, you use Snappy Mail by putting your login credentials into their authentication screen, letting it scrape down your e-mail, and present that account with a lightweight interface, rather than having accounts of its own.  However, once you do that for the first account, you can add additional mail accounts that you switch between from a drop-down menu.  That first e-mail address, then, gets treated as vaguely similar to a user account.

[^2]:  Also, on the topic of e-mail, I have no idea how I functioned on this laptop before buying the new one, because I definitely used Thunderbird, here.  This time, I spent a few days frustrated with five or six web-mail tabs open, then moved to [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org/), but even that took up most of available memory.  I can't imagine even pretending to run Thunderbird on this, let alone remember it working well.

The NGINX configuration looks something like this, keeping out of the *seriously* boring stuff.  You should notice, though, that each application (and the `assets` folder for one) needs slightly different handling.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name you-probably-don-t-care.local;
  location /assets/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/assets;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
  location /code-server/ {
    rewrite ^/code(/.*)$ $1 break;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600;
    proxy_send_timeout 3600;
  }
  location /forgejo/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    rewrite ^/git/(.*)$ /$1 break;
  }
  location /jellyfin/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8096;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
  }
  location /snappymail/ {
    alias /var/www/webmail/snappymail/;
    index index.php index.html;
    location ~ \.php$ {
      include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
      fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
      fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
    }
    location ~* \.(?:ico|css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|woff2?|ttf|svg|eot)$ {
      expires max;
      log_not_found off;
    }
  }
}
```

Add a plain HTML page at the NGINX root with links, so that I also don't need to remember what I actually called Jellyfin, and this seems to do the job, though one or two of the applications---at least Jellyfin---also need a "base URL" set with that path, before they'll respond.

For those planning to do something similar now that I brought it up, make sure that you disable or uninstall [Apache](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?httpd-http_server), which Raspbian may have installed by default.

In any case, I like having my in-house server, and may set up a partner for it[^3], with applications such as [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.org/), [Nodebook](https://github.com/netgusto/nodebook), and so forth.

[^3]:  Contingent on my finding an SD card to go with something so unused that I found it in its original (if slightly squished) box...

Technically, after missing a couple of birthdays during this mess---thank you, group e-mails, where I only looked late and not negligent---I also *started* setting up a calendar system.  That involved installing [Radicale](https://radicale.org/v3.html)---only to have Python waste a day before learning that I could install it as a normal Debian package---which can store and serve calendar and address book information, and [Inf Cloud](https://inf-it.com/open-source/clients/infcloud/) that can display the information reasonably well, but which has nightmarish documentation for (and *in*) its configuration file.  But, I have it running...except for the data, about which more in the next section.

Anyway, sometimes the system decides to drop off the network, maybe a crash, maybe not, but for the sake of decreasing the load on my current computer, and given that I already had the device sitting in a box, I'd call that a success that'll probably continue after I get everything back together.

### Data Recovery

During the week, I also picked up an NVMe-to-USB widget to attach the old hard drive, and...it worked.  The first time around, *something* went wrong as I investigated my files, sending me on a multi-hour search to figure out how to scrub the broken connection from the system so that I could try again.  And after that, I needed to run through the mount-and-unmount process once on the command-line.

Once I did that, though, the drive started behaving, with Ubuntu happily decrypting and mounting it for me to grab whatever I needed.

Things that I already had recovered perfectly and didn't know it?  My notes and works-in-progress space actually had everything up to date, *but* when I [updated all my git repositories to use a branch called `main`]({% post_url 2020-07-29-gitmain %}) away from of the more fascism-forward `master` a while back, I didn't update the *default* branch to match on these.  As a result, I had everything in the repository, but I sat on a branch that I didn't realize shouldn't exist anymore[^4].

[^4]:  If you have an old repository sitting around on a local computer---not on a hosting site---you can fix this by heading to the repository that you pull from.  Manually edit the `HEAD` file (which might sit in the `.git` folder, depending on how you set it up) and change the (only) line `ref: refs/heads/master` to `ref: refs/heads/main`, or whatever you actually need.  Then you can go back to your clone and delete the unwanted branch.

Things that I could recover perfectly?  Anything that I didn't think to back up, such as blog post drafts, and any in-progress work that I hadn't committed anywhere.  As far as I can tell, I actually have a fully working hard drive in the tiny aluminum box, despite the alleged crashes reported by the dead laptop that I started this process trying to repair.

Still in progress?  Application data, such as for Gnome's Authenticator app, don't seem to provide a clear path to combining the data from the old with any new logins that I've acquired since the crash.  Some will probably go smoothly once I learn what I need to do, such as RSS Guard.  Others, such the Authenticator and Thunderbird's calendar, will take more effort to either find a tool to export what I need as a usable format or enough documentation on their database schemas---they both use an SQLite database, so it could happen---that I can write a tool to do the work.

### Resettlement

As I mentioned in a previous week, I managed to get at least long-term temporary access to an empty Framework laptop, one of the rigs that they sold for a while to the DIY crowd at a slight discount.  As such, it lacks memory, a hard drive, and some other bits.  However, when I bought the NVMe-to-USB device, I picked up some maybe-compatible memory at an absurdly low price.  And in pulling the drive to recover data, I discovered/rediscovered that, when I bought the now-dead laptop, I bought it with a *second* hard drive that I never set up, of the size that the Framework machine uses.

If I can connect the thing to installation media, I could have that running soon, assuming that the cheap memory didn't go at that price for a reason...

## Stenotype Corner

While I have spent more time working outside where I don't have a convenient way of using the stenography keyboard, I have increased my commitment to using it when I have it at hand.  Again, I've mostly abandoned the drills for the time being, especially since I needed to increase the output delay to get whole words.  But I find the typing becoming more natural, with somewhat less thinking about needing to type the word and what fingers go where.

At this point, the "intentionality" definitely feels like the bottleneck.  When I type on a conventional keyboard, I've done it enough that letters mostly appear as I think the words, if I can keep up, almost never thinking about the spelling or where to find the keys on the keyboard.

By contrast, even when I know how a word breaks down in stenography, I still find myself breaking it down into the likeliest syllables and double-checking my finger placement.

### Dictionary Work

Note that I actually wrote this two weeks ago for the [Midsummer developer diary post]({% post_url 2025-06-23-midsummer %}), but lost it in the computer crash.  Having recovered it, along with needing to reproduce this work on the older laptop, it seemed worth preserving, even later than I expected.

In any case, more than two weeks ago, I started using the keyboard more often, including general movement. The default dictionary has the four cursor keys---up, down, left, and right---and a stroke for the "super key" that opens the application Launcher, which provides a start, It doesn't quite help enough, though, to make it viable for long-term work. I started working on figuring out how to page up and down, select text, and so forth...then realized that someone else must have had this problem and dealt with it.

And sure enough, some searching turned up the [Cross Platform Movement](https://www.openstenoproject.org/stenodict/dictionaries/cross_platform_movement.html) dictionary. That buys me additions like the aforementioned page up/down, but also allows for selection in most movements. Adding the cut, copy, and paste commands, and that makes this all far easier to use.

Since then, I have also added commands for Plover's so-called modes, allowing me to quickly type, I don't know, somethingInCamelCase or maybe something_in_snake_case, not to mention ALL CAPS. It won't save me any time with blog posts, where any such words probably came from copying-and-pasting from code, but it'll save time when I use the keyboard for programming.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

At this point, the application can read and write Markdown, assuming that you have a note with metadata in the right format...which you don't, yet.

I'll tell you, this code feels so much nicer that my hacky CSON routines, with almost everything that I needed built-in. Tcl actually has a YAML library, so reading and writing only takes something like this.

```
set note [yaml::yaml2dict $metadata]
yaml::dict2yaml $note
```

Each side needs a bit more work to make sure that it manages the note text separately, but that comes mostly from normal programming, moving dictionary elements around, not anything new.

While making sure that worked, it became clear that the sort didn't work and may never have worked quite right. Previously, it tried to sort the days as a string, which ignored that some notes had dates in single-quotes, some had double-quotes, and a couple used UNIX time, an integer. Now, it converts every date to a UNIX time-stamp before sorting.

Finally, the code no longer pays attention to the `stats` element. The YAML library doesn't handle nested objects well, and I never really understood the non-debugging use of carrying around duplicate dates and a bunch of low-level information such as inodes. **Notoboto** itself never really took that seriously, filling the space with placeholders, so it seemed like time to ditch them. If nothing else, it makes handling the new notes easier.

Actually, no, this week also brought a Markdown icon that should see use soon. Speaking of which...

## Next

Expect more of **Notoboto**, as I try to finish the new note format. You might also see some work on the blog, as I settle the recovered files from the other machine.
