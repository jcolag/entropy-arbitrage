Today marks the 144<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the swearing in of [José Miguel Carrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Miguel_Carrera) as President of the executive Junta of the government of Chile after a long military service.  While we don't generally celebrate military governments, his administration did form a lot of what we see as the country, promoted a free press, abolished slavery and legal immunity for the clergy, and founded a still-relevant school.

And on to the week's projects.

## Mini-Server, Part 15

I haven't updated anything on the server since about [a month ago]({% post_url 2025-10-13-disaster-risk %}), but I ran across a reference to [Moodist](https://moodist.mvze.net/), an ambient sound system, and decided that I liked the idea enough to give it a try locally.

It took some work to get it to properly deploy.  The [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework somehow insists on using absolute paths to all the assets, so what works as a preview site didn't work on my server.  To get that to work, buried in the documentation, but I guess so common that nobody really talks about it given how few references I could find, I needed to add this to the `astro.config.mjs` file, after the `integrations` array.

```JavaScript
  ],
  base: '/moodist/'
});
```

I added the middle line, showing the other two for context.  After that, `npm run build` gave me something that worked fine on my server.

Mind you, it might not see much use.  For my ambient sound needs---like when I sleep---I actually use [Blanket](https://apps.gnome.org//Blanket/), since it seems fairly lightweight in comparison to a web browser.  However, software occasionally breaks, so I always appreciate having a backup solution in-place for whatever I might need.  Plus, all this work started with a computer crash, you might recall, so the closer that I can get to the ability to pick back up after another crash, even for these minor details, the happier I'll feel.  Ideally, I want the capacity to get through a normal day from something like the cheap tablet that I use as a TV remote control without needing to scramble to install things.

Oh, and I also threw [Izo Wave](https://github.com/tangbobo/izowave) over on a whim.  As I have mentioned, I don't play games often, but I do like having a few interesting options available for the rare occasions that I do want to play something for a while.

## Salavi

{% codeberg jcolag/salavi %}

A lot of this week went into whipping the game into shape, so it now looks more like what I originally envisioned instead of only a mediocre Snakes and Ladders implementation.  Most prominently, the Owl now "patrols" the board, with animated jumps from his current location to a random destination.  If he lands on the player's new location, then the vigilante decides to defend the community from you, sending you back to the first initial cell.

In other words, I still wouldn't call it *fun* except as a concept, but you can actually play, after you generate a board.

## Notoboto

{% codeberg jcolag/Notoboto %}

Exporting a note to HTML during the week, and finding out that the Firefox-in-a-sandbox approach can't necessarily open the file reliably, I noticed that the exported page name had a carriage return in it.  That made it---and this probably won't surprise you much---difficult to open in Firefox from the command-line.  To fix that, the code now strips any spaces at the beginning or end of the note's filename before appending the `.html` suffix.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

As a minor change, the licensing icons now never show up as italic text, even if I specify a *license {% cc by-sa %} in italicized text* like that.

## Verdigris Genes

{% codeberg jcolag/verdigris-genes %}

I forget how far this project got, but a long while ago, before anybody considered slowing the productivity down and introducing more errors through "vibe coding," I had the idea of combining [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) with [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to generate code, but with the twist---inspired by theorizing around [homeobox genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox) at the time---to randomly generate *structured* code instead of code-like text, and also had a "genetic code" to remix from generation to generation.

Anyway, I have moved the repository over to Codeberg.

## City Automata

{% codeberg jcolag/city-automata %}

Honestly, I don't even remember why I started on this project, beyond "maybe it'll lead to something interesting," but using cellular automata rules and ideas from city-simulation games, this tried to "evolve" a city layout based on population distributions and traffic patterns.

Again, you can now find this over on Codeberg.

## Unnamed Cheapo Weather Client

{% codeberg jcolag/ucwc-weather %}

This mostly existed for me to give Python a semi-serious try, so I wouldn't try to use it or even look too closely at the code, and it might not even work anymore.  However, at the time, this desktop application (using Tk) would use Open Weather Map's (original) API to display the upcoming weather information for a specified city.  I'd call it ugly, but it convinced me that I could probably get accustomed to Python if I needed to...and then didn't need to.

And once again, you can find it on Codeberg and laugh at one of my few uses of Python.

## Roku Wake

{% codeberg jcolag/Roku-Wake %}

Hey, do you remember back talking about the mini-server in this post, when I mentioned that I use a low-end tablet as a remote control for my television?  I do that because, whether for reasons of defect or bad positioning, my television wouldn't consistently respond to the physical remote control, especially when trying to start it in the morning.

When I moved to Roku's tablet app, I had the thought of hitting the television's API  at the end of the script that I run overnight, hoping to "wake" the television so that it connects to the network before I make it to the living room.  That never worked reliably enough to bother, but this can---or at least *could*, last time I tried it, but don't know if Roku has changed or wiped out the API endpoints---act as a low-end remote control after the television has started up and gotten connected.

And if you want to play with it, you can find it on Codeberg.

## Phauxfiles

{% codeberg jcolag/phauxfiles %}

Again, I can't recall *why* I created this, maybe for some one-off project or maybe as a joke, but I can tell you that Rust has changed sufficiently over the past decade that it no longer builds.  Also, it relied on two APIs, neither of which has survived, so it wouldn't work even if it would build.  For whatever reason that I created it, *when* it worked, it generated an HTML page that resembled search results of user profiles, pulling the link to a (real) profile image under a usable license and a random name, and (if I remember correctly) some nonsense text as a bio.

If anybody needs something like this enough that they want to update it for the modern era of Rust and working APIs, you can (yes) find it on Codeberg, now.  Also, at the end of the README, I list a handful of APIs that I planned to use later, and some of them still seem to work, so you might want to check it out for that alone.

## Tikili-li-Takili-li-Ptoe

{% codeberg jcolag/Tikili-li-Takili-li-Ptoe %}

As a quick experiment using [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) (called GTK+ at the time), I created a tic-tac-toe desktop game with the silliest name that I could think of.  For reference, *tekeli-li* comes from Edgar Allan Poe's [**The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Narrative_of_Arthur_Gordon_Pym_of_Nantucket), later borrowed by H.P. Lovecraft for [**At the Mountains of Madness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), and the repeated cries reminded me of the game at the time.  However, cosmic horror has no effect on the game that I know of.

In any case, it will come as no surprise that you can now find the project on Codeberg, if that sort of thing interests you.

## Codeberg Profile

{% codeberg jcolag/.profile %}

Since I *believe* that Tikili-li-Takili-li-Ptoe makes the last project on GitHub that still has enough value to drag over to Codeberg, and so I now officially "live" on Codeberg, it seemed worth adding a quick profile there.

By default, Codeberg's software shows a sidebar with user information, then the repository list to the right.  Adding a `.profile` repository renders its `README.md` file under a new *Overview* tab to the left of the repository list.  Stripping down the profile that I've used over on GitHub, you can [see the results](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/) you-know-where...

## Next

As I mentioned, I don't expect to have any more projects to drag over to Codeberg from GitHub---everything else, I believe, forked somebody else's repository to contribute, never really launched, or has fallen so far out of date that any attempt to resurrect the project would require starting over---so these posts should return to their usual lengths soon.

This week, then, I expect that I'll try to finish up the needed work on Salavi, then try to get rid of the separate step of generating the page.  Actually, I may also look at having the Owl also knock the snakes and/or ladders to different locations when landing on them, something that I [suggested that I wanted]({% post_url 2022-05-30-andrews %}) over three years ago.

After that, I may set up the same sort of infrastructure that I use for my GitHub profile over on Codeberg, updating the page with the latest blog posts.
