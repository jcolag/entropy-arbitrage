## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## All Good Things..., Part 2

Picking up where we left off (or a bit past it), with the ship on red alert.  What happened on **Deep Space Nine** since then?  Literally nothing, because the two parts of this aired uninterrupted.  At most, we got a few commercials...

 > **RIKER**: Captain, maybe not acting is what causes the destruction of mankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and you weren't there?

I think that this episode decided that it needed to rip off [*Time Squared*]({% post_url 2023-02-16-time-squared %}), of all its possible targets.  Maybe [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}), too.  Or maybe the crew does this a lot...

Also, I suppose that it shouldn't catch me off-guard, at this point, but Riker's characterization of "mankind" seems telling.  Not only did the term already feel outdated when the episode aired, but wiping out the galaxy seems like it would've destroyed more than humanity.  Granted, *I* don't have a convenient non-exclusionary term for all conscious life in the galaxy, either.  But *I* haven't spent seven years preaching that the science fiction version of the Reagan Revolution meant that they only do "the good kinds of racism."

 > **DATA**: That is true. Q's interest in you has always been very similar to that of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy, Captain.

Even in the middle of a possible crisis, they need to prioritize Picard's fragile ego over solutions, I suppose.  That seems noteworthy, especially given how the main story largely ends with the Voice of the Writers (Q) talking Picard up.

 > **WORF**: I must refuse. It is for your own safety. The Neutral Zone is extremely volatile. If Admiral Riker had given you a starship with a cloak, you would have been safe. It is hard to believe that even he would refuse to help you.

Apparently, the Neutral Zone **does** still exist, at least in the notional sense that I mentioned [last time]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}) where people use the territory's former name.

Also, with the Romulan government no longer independent, it sounds like Starfleet has decided that the treaty mentioned in [*The Pegasus*]({% post_url 2025-08-14-pegasus %}) no longer matters.

 > **WORF**: Dor sHo GHA! You have always used your knowledge of Klingon honor and tradition to get what you want from me.

I mean, if the episode wants to openly tell us that Picard has manipulated his people, and that they resent him for it, then maybe I'll go for a walk instead of finishing this...

 > **PICARD**: Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted to inform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station.

Again, you'll notice that he *could* give Riker instructions to save the starving, enslaved creature over there, but...nah, let it suffer, I guess.

You might *not* notice that we never see no-beard Riker speak, suggesting that his appearance here comes from first-season footage with new dialogue to avoid making him shave.  Back before we had the amazing technology to digitally foul up Henry Cavill's face to pretend that he didn't grow a mustache[^ayv_Pn], Hollywood once to need to reuse archived footage...

[^ayv_Pn]:  And it only cost them twenty-five million dollars, I gather.

 > **TROI**: Actually, sir, there is. I was debating whether to mention it, and perhaps...It's about Commander Riker.
 >
 > **PICARD**: What about him?

Massive sexual harassment liability, abuses of power, talks to minors about sex for some reason, racist, Oedipal complexes coming out of his ears, possibly murdered his first crew...who even knows where to *begin* on a question like this?

However, the *Enterprise* has entire families aboard, so what does it matter if she once had a relationship with one of her colleagues?  I mean, it could matter only because they'll work directly together, something that has, in fact, caused the crew trouble in the past.  But also, we don't have to go too far back in our history to find companies looking for reasons to avoid hiring people (especially women) in relationships; I can still remember the days---around when this aired, in fact---when we still got constant reminders that a corporate interviewer can no longer legally ask much about our lives outside the office because of those terrible policies of the past.

 > **PICARD**: Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
 >
 > **COMPUTER**: That beverage has not been programmed into the replication system.

I mentioned in the first half that the servant's mocking of Picard asking for tea indicated that he has had trouble with the computer's voice recognition.  And this *might* confirm it, because we've had [Earl Grey tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea) for about two hundred years now, depending on how you count.  Unless they created the replicators recently, it seems unlikely that nobody has put together the "recipe" where the ship's computer can access it, unless it can't understand Picard's request.

 > **TOMALAK**: So, Captain how long shall we stare at each other across the Neutral Zone?

We last saw (a simulation of) Tomalak in [*Future Imperfect*]({% post_url 2023-12-28-future-imperfect %}).

 > **PICARD**: There is an alternative, Tomalak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the anomaly in the Devron System.

With all the ships parked here, does he really expect that none of them will report this serious treaty breach to their respective governments...?

 > **CRUSHER**: I understand that you would never have tolerated that kind of behavior back on the *Enterprise* and I won't here. I don't care if you're my ex-captain or my ex-husband.

First Worf, then Crusher.  And he'll continue to mansplain the plot as if she hasn't heard it five times by now.  When did the franchise start agreeing with me...?

Also, where did Crusher's new accent come from?

 > **DATA**: That is a most intriguing idea, sir. I do not believe a tachyon beam was ever used in such a way. I had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory, sir.

Wow, we also have somebody calling Picard out on pretending that he cares about science...

 > **OGAWA**: Doctor we've just gotten reports from two crew-members who say they have old scars which are healing themselves.

We last saw Ogawa in [*Genesis*]({% post_url 2025-10-02-genesis %}), by the way.

 > **RIKER**: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by. I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention.

And by "get their attention," I guess that he means mass murder.  Yay?

Note, though, how this fits with the way that we've seen the crew treat powers such as the Romulans and Cardassians patrolling their borders, in episodes such as [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %}) and [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}).

 > **PICARD**: Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth?

Like...explicitly, something like an hour ago, right?

 > **RIKER**: I never did anything to stand in his way.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Didn't you, Will?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thought that we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you have all the time in the world, until. Yeah.

In other words, he did everything to stand in their way, because of his petty jealousy.  And because women don't get an actual say in relationships---see Crusher's comments in this and the previous half---Troi quietly died off-screen so that neither squabbling man would feel slighted, like reimagining the [Judgment of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Solomon), but both prospective mothers offer up their own knives for the division...

Again, if the episode wants to say these things out loud, should I have taken the week off...?

 > **PICARD**: Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward?

Not only have they given us indication after indication that Picard should know the *Enterprise* in all three eras, no matter the goofy cosmetic alterations, it also seems like---especially given the response that he gets, along with the sign indicating deck-06 on the door---the name provides most of the directions for getting there.

I mean, back when we used to go out to shop, people treated me like I had a superpower, because I understood the idea of what we used to call---but apparently no longer do, since I can't find any references on it to link, here---a *water wall*.  Specifically, because nobody wants to pay to have pipes spidering around a commercial space if they don't need to, if you can find one device that needs water, then you can guess where to find restrooms, any water fountains, any kitchens, and so forth, because the pipes all probably run through that same wall.

That didn't make me smart, only slightly more knowledgeable and patient than somebody in need of a toilet or sink.  And I make that distinction, because where the heck else would you look for "Ten Forward" on a ship than the front part of deck ten?

 > **DATA**: I think I know what the Captain's talking about. If I'm not mistaken, he's describing a paradox.

I mean, no, Picard doesn't describe any such thing, because none of this mess contradicts itself, but whatever gets us past the fake science...

 > **RIKER**: Mister Data, we need a solution, and we need it now.

Does the future-*Enterprise* not have a science team that could help?

 > **PICARD**: I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were in your position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. But you're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. I know it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take the ship into the very center of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not survive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greater purpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each other, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only been together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you for a leap of faith, and to trust me.

What!?  No, really.  What the actual heck...?

Let me try to parse this.

- He wants them to endanger their lives.
- Yar has (rightly) pointed out that, to get their buy-in, he needs to explain.
- He admits that he has no explanation for his orders.
- Except that we know that he does, and for some reason has chosen not to confide in them despite quickly confiding in the other two versions of the crew.
- Despite his assertion that he doesn't have a reason, they should trust that he has a reason anyway.
- They don't trust him, and have no reason to trust him, but they should totally trust him.
- By the way, in the last few hours or couple of days or whatever, they have proved themselves the best in the fleet...even though he doesn't trust them enough to explain why he wants them to risk their lives. {% emoji thumbs up %}

And they *buy* that utter slop?  It barely even makes sense, let alone feels inspirational.  It boils down to him having authority over them, so they should shut their mouths and follow orders...which he could have said in the first place.

 > **YAR**: Captain, the sensors are picking up two other ships.

Did they mean to swipe a bunch from [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}) in this sequence?  Multiple *Enterprise*s in space while they try to do the thing, a frazzled Riker, some versions of the ship don't make it...

 > **Q**: The anomaly. My ship. My crew. I suppose you're worried about your fish, too. Well, if it puts your mind at ease, you've saved humanity once again.

First off, has Picard *ever* saved humanity?  He has endangered it multiple times, including literally in this episode by walking right into Q's trial by powering the spacetime dingus, but also most prominently in [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-11-09-best-both-worlds-part-2 %}), but failing to destroy Earth seems to differ significantly from saving anybody, somehow.

Second, yes, dammit, **what happened to the fish?**

 > **Q**: Exactly. For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options you had never considered. That is the exploration that awaits you. Not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknowable possibilities of existence.

And we've fallen back into New Age meandering, none of which remotely resembles the episode that I watched.

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, what's the date?
 >
 > **WORF**: Stardate 47988.
 >
 > **TROI**: Is something wrong, sir?

He hasn't missed it.  The spirits have done it all in one night.  They can do anything they like.  Of course they can...

What?  If they want to recycle lines of the script, then *I* get to recycle the joke.

 > **RIKER**: I cheat. I'm kidding.

I mean...they've made it fairly clear that La Forge, Data, and Troi all cheat---from [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), *Cause and Effect*, and [*Eye of the Beholder*]({% post_url 2025-09-25-eye-beholder %})---with their advantages that they can't turn off, and sometimes try to compensate for those advantages, so this doesn't seem like a huge leap.  And Riker has cheated in higher-stakes situations, such as helping Troi to pass her test in [*Thine Own Self*]({% post_url 2025-09-11-thine-own-self %}), so...

 > **DATA**: I believe, however, this situation is unique. Since the anomaly did not occur, there have already been changes in the way this timeline is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly be different from the one the Captain encountered.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what happens in that future allows us to change things now, so that some things never happen.

...OK, but this feels much more like an argument against their silly rules against sending information backwards in time than it does an explanation of why Picard doing it this time wouldn't hurt.  If the future always changes, then it can't possibly matter what Picard tells them more than any other advice.

Also, not to nitpick, but the future that we saw already didn't have the anomaly in it, until the *Pasteur* created it.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, err, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite a card player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long time ago.

Sure, why not?  He has forced them to socialize with him in a bunch of other situations, why not impose himself---as usual, during "business hours"---on them while they try to relax...?

## Assorted Quick Commentary

Not under a Free Culture license, so I won't go into depth on anything (of anybody else's) here, but I'd encourage you to read "friend of the blog" [Mup's post on this episode](https://gius.uk/trek/TNGFinale/) trying to answer the question of what purpose the pre-pilot scenes serve for this episode?  I broke down Picard's absurdist soliloquy, but they also try to figure out how any of this nonsense fits into what I characterized as the apparent *A Christmas Carol* frame.

I suggested in response---when Mup first posted it on Cohost, I mean---that maybe (but probably not) the scene wants to explain why the crew uncritically follows the Archie Bunker in Space that showed up through the first season.  Like any abusive relationship, the crew overlooks the mean-spirited moments, because deep down, he cares about them, which they extrapolate from that word salad.

As you might guess, though, I never really believed that, and Mup's post makes the entirely valid point that the episode utterly fails at presenting its three eras as meaningful in any significant way.  Three times, they treat his claims with some healthy skepticism at first, then decide to humor him, because...his name comes first in the credits, I suppose.  And that seems like a *huge* problem in an episode that allegedly revolves around Picard's personal growth, his capacity to make himself "open to options you had never considered," as Q put it.

In fact, you'll notice that the episode *attempts* to pitch this in three ways, overlaid on all three eras.  First, we have the thing that Q actually means, Picard's ability to try some crackpot spacetime thing that somebody else suggested.  Then, we have how Picard commands his crew, which the episode proudly tells us has always worked perfectly, no notes.  And finally, we have Picard's treatment of his (alleged) friends, where multiple people in the future tell him that they resent his constant emotional blackmail, which he actually excuses *because it works*, and the ends justify the means, refusing to even acknowledge them as anything more than tools to use.

In other words, the episode pitches us three ways that Picard could have grown---intellectual or spiritual, professional, and emotional---and shoots down the two that we'd consider most important as people who presumably care about the characters as more than their academic knowledge.  But wait!  Picard has dug crackpot pseudoscience since at least [*Where No One Has Gone Before*]({% post_url 2022-06-23-gone %}), has insisted on taking random legends seriously since at least [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}), and [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}) strongly hinted that Picard has felt that way since before he applied to Starfleet Academy.  Has he changed in forty-whatever years, then?  If he hasn't, then what did we actually do, here?

None of them changes, really.  Data comes the closest, but even then, he only grows in superficial ways such as diction.  Oh, and I guess Troi changed, to the extent that she stopped living.  Did we really go through seven seasons of this for Picard to realize that he could force his way into poker games with his colleagues?

Oh, and speaking of the poker games, Mup also [went through those scenes](https://gius.uk/trek/Poker/) to see which of them do useful work for the series, and how that builds to the final scene here.  At the time, I suggested adding the breakfast fiasco in the aforementioned *Time Squared* as a precursor to the cards, but still see less in them than they do.

## Conclusions

While I admittedly expected to mostly sleep through this post, given its focus on resolving the plot, it also has quite a few scenes that seem written specifically for these posts...

### The Good

The future exposes that the crew largely sees Picard as trash, and resent his petty manipulations.

### The Bad

The episode focuses our attention on Picard's ego, both in the sense that Data needs to correct himself when Picard feels hurt, and how Q makes this about his personal ability to grow.

Despite finally seeing hurt reactions to it, the episode not only exposes Picard as manipulating everybody around him, but he sees it as legitimate, because it works.

When Picard abandons his first mission in the past, he apparently decides that the entity that he rescued no longer matters, not even giving his colleagues pointers of what they might want to investigate, when he informs them of the schedule delay.

At least in the future, where they tell us about international tensions, they seem to cheer the mass-deaths of Klingons policing their borders.  This fits with Riker only worrying about the fate of "mankind" in the broad destruction.

We again get a strong impression that women primarily exist to satisfy the romantic desires of men.  If more than one man wants the same woman in their lives, then the woman must wither away until the men can come to an arrangement that satisfies them.

We also see a surprising amount of intellectual laziness.  At least Picard has never figured out that Ten Forward lies at the front of deck-ten.  Data thinks that he can have a paradox without contradictions.  The future-*Enterprise* with the *Pasteur* crew doesn't round up every scientist to work on their universe-ending problem.  The early-*Enterprise* crew accepts Picard's unhinged rambling that amounts to "because I said so."  And the triumphant crew can't seem to follow the sequence of events.

### The Weird

Apparently, the Federation only hasn't used cloaking devices because of a treaty with the Romulans.

Troi also seems to have viewed her prior relationship with Riker as a potential danger to the ship, for unclear reasons.

## Stay Tuned...

We have survived the series, but we haven't finished, yet.  Next week---Thanksgiving around these parts of the world---we'll summarize what we've learned over the seventh season.  Then, on the fourth, we'll jump back in with this crew's part of **Generations**.

I haven't decided, yet, but I may split the films across two weeks.  I don't expect any of them to supply us with much material, but I remember covering the whole films for the original cast films felt more frantic than I'd like.  Plus, I actually haven't seen two of the films, so I can't "cheat" by thinking through some ideas in advance based on memory.  I'll probably split them...
