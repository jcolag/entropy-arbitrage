As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Oh, a quick off-book pre-bonus from the past:  Because a certain obnoxious billionaire has taken up increasing amounts of the news cycle for bigotry and crime, people *might* want to look at a [2022 investigation into his immigration status](https://archive.ph/gzGpF) and degree.

 > Melanin‚Äôs implications for drug safety and dosing have been largely overlooked, raising alarming questions about the efficacy of standard dosing since people vary a lot in skin tones.

Hashtags:  #Medication #Melanin

I realize that I bring up medical racism a lot, but *seriously*, you can only ever get a situation like this if you never have a Black person in your drug trials.  Then, denying the situation leads to doctors dismissing the concerns of Black patients as trying to scam more drugs than they "need."

 > Today‚Äôs events are tomorrow‚Äôs history, yet events seen by the naked eye lack the depth and breadth of human struggles, triumphs and suffering. Writing history is writing the soul of the past.

I don't really have anything to say about this, other than that I assume that Harris already knows how this works...

I look forward to more independent media, especially focusing on feminist issues.  I had high hopes for several women-run outlets over the years, only for them to cover the same vapid stories as corporate outlets in hopes of proving some sort of vague objectivity.

I find this mildly amusing, given how many projects already exist like this without any language models involved, and I don't see how this improves on having a person write the fake counterarguments.

I don't need to explain this to anyone, right?  They do this to make life miserable, because hopeless people do reckless things, not because they have anything like a point.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/writing-by-hand-learning-1600.jpg|Focus on a pencil that a little girl holds as she does homework|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Students learn better writing by hand](https://www.futurity.org/writing-by-hand-learning-3253352-2/) from Futurity

 > The researchers investigated students who wrote using a tablet, both with a digital pen and with a digital keyboard. They contend that the effect is the same as whether you use a regular pen or pencil. It is the formation of the letters that is important.

From my days tutoring in college, I know that we not only knew that decades ago, but that writing *on the blackboard* (or whiteboard) works better than paper, either because of the size, the perspective, or getting the student out of their seat.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/get-rss.jpg|A guerilla soldier with an RSS belt standing atop a pile of mainframe computers|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [You should be using an RSS reader](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise) from Pluralistic

 > Not just blogs. Do you follow a bunch of substackers or other newsletters? They've all got RSS feeds. You can read those newsletters without ever registering in the analytics of the platforms that host them. The text shows up in black and white (not the sadistic, 8-point, 80% gray-on-white type these things all default to). It is always delivered, without any risk of your email provider misclassifying an update as spam.

I also recommend setting up something like the [Awesome RSS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/) browser plugin, which lights up when a site links to its RSS feed.  Browsers used to have that functionality built in, but removed it when the "everybody uses social media instead of RSS for news" propaganda spread.
