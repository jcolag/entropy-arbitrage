## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Star Trek:  The Next Generation, Final Summary

While I'll continue rewatching the franchise and writing about it, this ends a significant phase of it, especially considering how **The Next Generation** has somehow become the backbone of the franchise.  Rather than blandly collect the prior summaries---the [first season]({% post_url 2022-11-17-ng-season-1 %}), [second season]({% post_url 2023-04-27-ng-season-2 %}), [third season]({% post_url 2023-11-02-ng-season-3 %}), [fourth season]({% post_url 2024-05-09-ng-season-4 %}), [fifth season]({% post_url 2024-11-14-ng-season-5 %}), [sixth season]({% post_url 2025-05-22-ng-season-6 %}), and [seventh season]({% post_url 2025-11-27-ng-season-7 %}), and the [films and leftovers]({% post_url 2026-02-12-ng-films %})---I'd rather briefly talk about some broader themes that we've seen so far, seemingly blatant to me, but weirdly downplayed by fans and modern writers.

## Conclusions

First, in many ways, like the original series looks a lot like the 1960s, **The Next Generation** shows a world that looks eerily like at least some versions of the 1980s into the 1990s.  They never *say so*, because nobody sits down and describes their culture as resembling another, except in times of crisis.  But Picard consistently pitches an adaptation of [American exceptionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism), and you can even see echoes throughout the series of what became Ronald Reagan's farewell address and its political context.

> I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.

Like Reagan, elites in the Federation see their space "teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace."  And like the United States at the time (and now, sadly...), they  quietly ignore that *certain* "kinds" of people only really get to live in harmony and peace if they shut up about discrimination and historical disadvantages that limit their social mobility.  It has open doors, but some people walking through those doors find themselves subject to constant harassment or even questions about whether they deserve civil liberties.  The place seems "stronger than oceans," but they have dissident movements who want out, and people occasionally predict a collapse.

### Utopian Dreams

Like the original series, this shows nothing like the utopia that people seem to claim.  Unlike the original series, though, this cast *sees* their world as utopian, with no need or desire for improvement.

It raises the question, more concisely and thoroughly asked by friend-of-the-blog Mup than here, [why to progressives like **TNG**?](https://gius.uk/trek/TheNub/) which really interrogates why anybody could ever it weird that *conservatives* lap this show up.  Having since finished the series, I might add that even the belief that they show a post-capitalist society seems questionable, given that Starfleet often seems to make decisions based on budgeting, and how comfortable everybody seems with money (and gambling) when the opportunity presents itself.  But they have prisons, oppression of separatists, exploitation of vulnerable populations, ethnic cleansing, and more.  I don't get why any non-fascist thinks of this mess as a world to aspire to, let alone somewhere that most progressives should find tolerable.

I have had this question on my mind through watching all seven seasons (plus films) of this, especially since so much of modern *Star Trek*---parts of **Discovery** and **Prodigy**, and most of **Picard**, **Lower Decks**, and **Strange New Worlds**---owes its structure or outlook to **TNG**[^z_SKsT], to the point that you could almost tell new fans that they can "catch up" on the franchise by only watching a handful of episodes of this show.  And I can't come up with a better answer than...maybe people find Patrick Stewart's voice comforting?  He seems like a nice guy, even though he plays an absolute monster with no self-awareness.

[^z_SKsT]:  You can see this most bluntly with the "what's your thing?  You know, the thing that you say when you order the ship to go?" bit that every show now does with every new captain, even though it didn't have a historical basis outside this one show.  But as I've said repeatedly, you can also see it in how **Strange New Worlds** models itself on exactly this kind of patriarchal family, which gets together for regular home-cooked meals, and also doesn't worry about inequality unless it impacts one of the family.

Maybe somebody who sees this as utopian---and who doesn't worry about "socialism" and "woke," because I already get your love...---would like to enlighten me in the comments.

### Personal Growth

Also like the original series, I can't think of many more interesting aspects of the series than how many of the characters do not remotely resemble their reputations in popular culture.  In fact, fans view most of the main characters as almost the opposite of how their dialogue and actions portray them.

#### Picard

The captain has the reputation of a thoughtful, kind diplomat...somehow.  But at almost every opportunity, we see that his idea of peace involves human supremacy, and his thoughtfulness often involves reckless action because the risk (even to his thousand colleagues) makes him feel alive.

He seems to think that he has a right to transgress the boundaries of any woman who he finds attractive, too.  And the man *loves* his authoritarianism, whether assuming that governments enforcing castes and holding political prisoners probably have good reasons---especially if the leaders wear blazers---or outright demands that his people, often even civilians, follow orders without question.

Far from a curious and motivated student of many fields, he consistently exposes himself as a poser in the few fields that he allegedly finds interesting, except for archaeology.  There, he understands it as a way to extract value from other cultures to pad his personal collection of artifacts and relics.

And he seems incredibly out-of-touch with reality.  He'll lecture anybody too lazy to run away that humanity and/or the Federation has outgrown issues such as inequality, violence, bigotry, and so forth, often even as he personally demonstrates exactly the opposite[^hRBTft].  And I have mentioned this many times, but it bears repeating that we shouldn't trust the man who grew up in his family's ancestral castle to tell us about contentment among the rabble.

[^hRBTft]:  As a quick preview, **DS9** has an episode where O'Brien talks openly about this split in himself, the belief in the Federation's perfection seeing that he doesn't live up to that standard, and that it hasn't worked out well for him.

#### Riker

While Riker's reputation comes *closer* to what we see on the screen, what we see comes off as so much worse, a prototype of the JD Vance to Picard's Trump, thinking that his beard makes him powerful, and that he can sweet-talk any woman into his bed, because he "understands" their plight.  Or he openly harasses them, because he has the power and they don't.  But he expresses sometimes-violent jealousy if any man comes anywhere near "his woman," who broke up with him years ago.  And that completely ignores his Oedipus complex in the first few seasons, simultaneously craving Picard's validation and wanting that status for himself.

Like Picard (and Vance), he paints himself as a man of the people, quietly ignoring his background of political power.

I remember, years ago, somebody online mentioning in passing that they couldn't find any redeeming feature in Riker, except that he plays the trombone in an era when popular culture packed itself full of saxophone players.  And...I can't really disagree.  Maybe I'd add that he sometimes delivers a joke well.

#### Troi

I feel like Troi gets a lot of good press, suggesting that the show doesn't writer her well, and mostly limiting her personality to "...nice."  But at the best of times, Troi *barely* does her job at all.  Her "billable hours" seem to go far more towards helping Picard guess whether somebody has lied to him (or telling us to appreciate lines of the script) than helping her colleagues deal with their constant trauma.  And when we do see her providing anything like therapy to people, we find out that she mostly manipulates her patients until her empathy powers stop picking up sad feelings.  More often, she pawns them off on a holographic video game that she hasn't investigated for herself.

Then, personally, she hauls out all sorts of clichés.  As the counterpart to Riker's Oedipus complex, she has her Electra complex, outright referring to her father as her first love while consistently objecting to her mother's presence.  Her personality revolves around chocolate and dating.  And she only considers taking her job seriously out of jealousy from seeing her former peers' career advancement after a reunion.

#### Data

People really like the [reply-guy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reply_guy) incarnate, for some reason.  Well, not "incarnate," I guess, because he doesn't have any meat on him.  I'll go with "reply-guy embodied," then.  The show (and fans) pitch him as this stoic machine striving to understand human emotions, lovable like a puppy.

He absolutely has emotions from the beginning, though, but everybody calls those reactions something else, because androids *can't have* emotions.  Like Troi, though, he thoroughly lacks (non-psychic) empathy for other people, even when he allegedly "has emotions."  He goes through the motions with people who he attaches to, but doesn't respect anybody's time, boundaries, or feelings, arguably not even understanding that they have them.  But he can describe in detail his own irrational feelings of attachment and contradictions in emotional events.

Also seemingly unnoticed, Data frequently talks about his desire to assimilate in hopes of reducing the discrimination that he faces.  People see his attempts at assimilation as cute, but it consistently feels like it indicts everyone around him.

#### Worf

In sharp contrast to Picard, Worf has a reputation for recklessness and violence, but with some exceptions, almost always acts with kindness and sometimes even serves as the crew's conscience.  And he does a pretty terrible job with violence, most of the time.

Worf absolutely has his problems---most prominently, probably sexism---but he often seems like the only member of the crew with any principles or restraint.

#### And the Rest

La Forge and Crusher both seem barely relevant, most of the time.  They both have jobs that sometimes move the plot along, sure.

The engineer, though---also sometimes a pilot, but not really, and also sometimes the person who rolls down a window to get a better look around, no doubt all because of his great engineering skill and not because the show cast him as a token Black person---never seems to think anything through, leaving the morality and ethics to people who get paid more.  That doesn't even bother with his ideas of romance as almost mechanical.  Maybe notably, though I didn't always have a line to pin it to, but La Forge also seems to not understand the technology at all, often finding it surprising when somebody suggests using a device for its intended purpose to get out of a crisis.

And Crusher does often (but not always) think deeply about the ethical ramifications of her work, but nobody cares what she has to say.

Pulaski, notably, copies McCoy almost in his entirety, down to characters referring to her powerful empathy, even as she treats non-humans like second-class citizens.

And then we have Wesley.  Like Riker, his reputation has similarities to what we see on screen, but the reality seems *so* much worse.  People think of him as a smug kid who the writers seem to have pushed early on to please Eugene Wesley Roddenberry.  And while that sometimes still feels accurate, that feels like it wants to condemn curious children for things that they *really* can't control.  And it also lets the character off the hook for the constant bigotry and self-entitlement.  We have seen him peddle the idea that you can do racism in a totally respectful way, suggest that (allegorical) transgender people exist to "trick" him, laughs at the lower classes, nearly kill people because he didn't want to turn off his experiment.  Away from the ship, he settles into an authoritarian groove, even only confessing to participating in and covering up negligent homicide *after* the hearing collapses due to lack of evidence.  And did I ever mention that a deleted scene praises his Confederate soldier ancestor...?

Recurring characters vary more wildly, from O'Brien's often overt racism---which we'll need to talk about a lot more over on **Deep Space Nine**, because it doesn't go away---to Ro Laren demanding that the Federation do better, and almost everything in between.

### Economics

Like the original series, contrary to fan lore, we seem to find massive inequality time and again.  We haven't seen anything like the original series, where some people have so much wealth that Starfleet treats them personally as a sovereign government, whereas other people turn to black market activities to make ends meet.  Yet we do see that an upper class largely staffs Starfleet, representatives of figurative and occasionally literal dynasties stretching back hundreds of years, whether in military service, wealth, or political power.

Picard's family centers on its ancestral castle---which we later learn they only lost briefly to the Nazis during World War II---and has had known soldiers and explorers in his family for nearly a thousand years.  Riker can (we'll find out during **Voyager**) similarly point to soldiers and diplomats in his family for over five hundred years.  Troi's parents served as officer and ambassador, her mother seemingly also an aristocrat and an inheritor of some religious authority.  La Forge's parents both have important Starfleet positions.  Worf, though usurped for most of the time that we see him here, has an aristocratic background in his home culture, along with his adoptive family having important positions.  Wesley Crusher can trace his paternal ancestry to nineteenth century soldiers.  Even Data, who doesn't have a family in a biological sense, has a *creator* whose ancestry stretches to the twentieth century, (retroactively) working on almost any important advance that writers care to feature.

And we have characters like Yar and her sister coming from an abandoned colony where everybody fights every day for survival, or Jason Vigo surviving on petty crime.

Now, as people have reminded me over the years, detailed genealogy only serves as a loose proxy for wealth.  Some families do obsess over tracing ancestry for academic reasons or (after reversing the process to find other descendants) to cast a wide net for inviting people to family reunions.  However, the idea does originate in pedigree and judging inheritance, and you need either a strong motivation or many generations of the preservation of records to work back through multiple centuries, and all those correlate strongly with wealth.

And it seems notable that the characters command respect roughly *proportional to* that background.  Picard's conquistador ancestor trumps the two descents from Civil War soldiers, which trump the line of scientists, which trumps the two aristocrats, which trump the child of fellow officers, which trumps Crusher's uncredentialed healer grandmother among an undistinguished line of women of whom nobody could find anything more interesting to talk about than their eye color and their secret ghost boyfriend.

Beyond the rich kids and nepotism, we also see a capitalist-style economy in plenty of evidence that Starfleet weighs its activities based on budget.  Everything from medical treatment to technology choice to ship salvage takes its cues from what amounts to a return on investment, talking about the rarity of diseases, energy efficiency, or similar.

Trade deals also dominate their foreign policy when we see it, where we see repeatedly that access to valuable resources justifies accepting massive civil liberties lapses in other cultures.  And to the extent that they explore the galaxy, they do so for resources, whether worlds to exploit or ancient weapons to claim for themselves.  We no longer see the overt insistence that colonized worlds produce resources for the rest of the Federation, but those resources still hold a powerful influence.

Similarly, they repeatedly tell us to value a person's life by their ability to produce.  We see suggestions in the first season that marriage exists as an institution to produce more workers and that families serve as a unit of productivity.  We also see a stigma attached to taking non-working time off for any reason, and that people should only retire when they no longer have the physical capacity to perform their jobs.  They can only even argue against eugenics on the basis of the productivity loss in excluding people from society.  And they can think of no better epitaph for somebody who died saving many lives than that they did their duty.

### Social Justice

Not only do we have the sexism and racism from the original series, and the economic inequality outlined above, but they have added explicit statements suggesting poor treatment of anybody whose ancestry doesn't draw entirely from members of the Federation.  They have laws blocking people with certain heritages from taking at least some jobs.  Refugees and their descendants face expectations that they'll abandon anything that connects them to their cultures, with the expectation that can still only have divided loyalties.  Immigrant children face bullying.  And artificial life doesn't have any civil rights, only ever brief acknowledgement that they probably should have rights, before threatening to kill them if they don't follow orders and fit in.

Many also seem to live in ethnic enclaves, even among human ethnicities.  We see some evidence that many Japanese people live immersed in traditional Japanese culture, for example, and that Black people[^hTdPN3] live in Africa.  Similarly, few non-humans seem to have grown up around other cultures, unless they have specific family ties.

[^hTdPN3]:  It didn't occur to me to check at the time, but in [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}), we get a glimpse of Crusher looking at La Forge's medical file, which identifies him as born in the African Confederation.  The remastered version of the screen narrows down his place of birth to [Mogadishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogadishu), Somalia.

On the gender side, we see expectations, time and again, that everybody expects women to succumb to the (dubious) charms of whatever man wants them, and to sacrifice their careers, and even identities, to child-rearing.  Women should leave their careers to follow the man in their lives, if the two careers diverge, but everybody finds it ridiculous to suggest that a man do the same.  If two men have a romantic interest in the same woman, then she has an obligation to waste away quietly while the men resolve the issue (or don't) between them.

Sometimes men wear skirts, though, so...*progress*, {% emoji eyeroll %} I guess

It seems most shocking in how the victims will sometimes talk openly about these problems, but nobody else cares.  People nod patiently when hearing about people assimilating to tamp down fears about them or bullying, and then they move on.

We also see or hear about prisons, wars, secret laws, and more.

### International Affairs

This series seems to diverge from the original most in how fascinated it finds itself with how everybody relates to foreign powers.

And by the way, if you don't mind my completely editorializing, here, this probably feels like the most alien aspect of the show, at least in its context.  Today, we all probably have acquaintances, maybe even colleagues and friends, from around the world.  Many of us thrive on imported (literally or through transplanting) foreign foods that we pick up at the local market.  And we follow global news with at least some sense of the context and meaning.

In the late-1980s to early-1990s, though?  If you knew people overseas, that either meant pen pals acquired through some service (no, not the episode) or wealth, because you needed to travel internationally to meet people internationally.  In the United States, I like to use cheese as my example, because far from the "cheese cases" that you see to day at grocery stores, you could choose from individually wrapped American cheese slices or pre-grated Parmesan cheese in a shaker; if your store had a deli counter, they might have two or three options.  And global news?  Unless a superpower did something extreme (or something directly impacted your interests), you probably didn't get much insight into the rest of the world.  Like the other aspects that I mention as examples, global news cost money.

We still had globalization ahead of us, and I suppose to its credit, **TNG** saw it coming faster than most of Hollywood did.  Characters here care deeply about events from distant places, at least paying attention selectively.

As with so much of this show, though, we see that globalization through bizarrely reactionary and xenophobic eyes.  They see every foreign power---except for the Klingons, but also definitely the Klingons---as a horrifying threat.

Everyone sees secret Romulan threats hiding behind every asteroid.  They go so far as to tell us that the Romulans have such *subtle* plans that they often (somehow?) trick rivals into attacking them, providing an excuse to retaliate in self-defense, which (somehow?) justifies preemptive espionage and threats against them.  We rarely see any such plot, and those few plots that we do see feel like they would have fallen apart even if the *Enterprise* hadn't intervened.  And in the few cases of international cooperation that we see, only the Romulan seems willing to speak to its value.

With the Ferengi, the Borg, and the Cardassians, by contrast, they prime everybody to see inhumane monsters, even as they show us the contrary.  And strangely, all these powers often serve as mirrors of the Federation, not in the traditional literary sense that they provide an opposite to bring the Federation into sharper relief, but in the colloquial sense that these governments and their people frequently do and say *exactly* the same things that we see the Federation doing and saying, but it makes them bad.

Other governments, they see as impediments, often seeing a culture's political power as laughable.  They monitor less-developed cultures, infiltrating them as they develop space travel in order to secretly seed support for joining the Federation after first contact.  If a more advanced culture doesn't have some power (usually economic) to assert its sovereignty, they'll violate local laws, break criminals out of prison, or kidnap officials, if it gets them what they want.  Even when they do follow local laws, they often do so in a condescending context, making it clear that they do so because they want to play along, not because they see an obligation.

And oh, the genocides.  They at least worked on a plan to wipe out around seven cultures, I believe, wanted to stand by as two cultures died out, and shrugged their shoulders when meeting somebody who confessed to personally annihilating an entire interstellar culture.  And except for one, the likely attempt to wipe out the Romulans, all these events happened within the seven years of the series.

### Overall

Much like the original series, we only see glimpses of civilian life, always on distant colony worlds.  In fact, it often feels like only three careers exist:  Something beholden to Starfleet (officer, scientist, ambassador, etc.), agrarian laborer, or petty criminal living on the edges of society.  People seem either wealthy or forgotten.  If we care about them, then they have a Starfleet or Starfleet-adjacent career, and everybody else, we shrug our shoulders when they inevitably die or get hauled off to prison for having the wrong grandparent.

Nobody respects academic work, often falling back on the idea that their educations never taught them anything actually useful.  Maybe not coincidentally, many of them also have stories about how poorly they performed in school.  In the rare cases when somebody shows enthusiasm for learning, people reflexively mock it as aberrant, possibly creepy.  And when someone can confidently assert that they enjoy something, they almost always show (us, if not their colleagues) that they either only have a superficial understanding of their chosen field or get the fundamentals wrong.

We also have the pervasive casual bigotry, already discussed somewhat.  Most characters show racist, sexist, and ableist tendencies.  And when we don't see that behavior first-hand, we hear about the trauma inflicted by it on its victims.

As I said at the top, I don't understand the people who see this as aspirational, because they paint a fairly bleak picture.

## Points of View

The show maybe most surprised me in how often I needed to question how they want us to see the crew.

Often, the show has felt to me like it presented full-throated support of authoritarianism, military might, xenophobia, and bigotry.  The characters see stereotypes and gender essentialism as respect.  They pine for the days when most of them would have died from a lack of medical treatment, others wouldn't have any legal rights, and the rest somebody would burn as a witch or demon.  And when they find a culture that parrots the talking points of Earth's worst regimes, they want to hear about real-estate prices.  They work hard to justify letting masses of people die.  Oh, and to repeat the factoid from above, they at least casually consider genocide around once per year *that we see* on this one ship.  As such, the series often feels like ham-fisted right-wing propaganda trying to sell us on this.

However, every once in a while, somebody says something that feels like a mask slipping away.  They briefly mention that the fascists wouldn't bring them into the inner circle.  A guest star tells them off or brushes off their self-importance.  They draw a quick historical analogy that fits *too* well and paints their side as wrong.  Their actions frequently conflict with their moralizing lectures, sometimes minutes before or after.  And sometimes they give us insight into an "official enemy" that makes them seem far more sympathetic, with no change in how the Federation treats them.

And all this raises a surprisingly serious question:  Do they mean us to *like* the Federation?

Especially in the absence of satirical "parallel Earths"---the staple crop of the original series, remember---after all, it would make perfect sense to make the Federation the "strange, new world" that could really use a lecture about how laws don't mean anything unless they apply to everyone equally, only the bad guys plan war crimes on a regular basis, or eugenics goes to pretty bad places.

Nobody gives those lectures, though.  We never see somebody pull Wesley aside to tell him that no, you *don't* have a good kind of racism or demand that he apologize for his extremely public "trans panic" rant condemning a head of state.  Nobody asks for a therapist who won't try to solve their emotions by whacking dopamine receptors.  And nobody threatens to haul Picard in front of a war crimes tribunal.  In fact, the arguable omnipotent voice of the writers (Q) stops by from time to time to make Picard feel good about himself.

For context, consider the original series, which repeatedly makes it clear that things have recently gotten *better*, but only through a fragile progress and that they still have a lot of room for improvement.  I've talked about what I think of as the "signature line" of each series, before, but it seems worth repeating for the illustration.

> All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers, but we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we won't kill today. Contact Vendikar. I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction. It's up to you.

Kirk, in [*A Taste of Armageddon*]({% post_url 2020-06-18-taste %}) accepts that the desire for violence runs deep, but argues that progress occurs by fighting that desire, calling it a victory every time we overcome it.  By contrast, when Q confronts Picard about humanity's failings in [*Hide and Q*]({% post_url 2022-07-21-hide-q %}), he has a different rebuttal.

> Oh, no. I know Hamlet. And what he might have said with irony, I say with conviction. *What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason. How infinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god*.

He doesn't quite commit to that as reality, but says that he sees "us one day becoming that," a far more passive affair than a constant internal fight to overcome violent urges.  Kirk has a goal worth fighting for, while Picard at least seems to think that humanity can coast to a great spot.  Picard seems to consistently believe this nonsense, but maybe the show doesn't, because of that occasional push-back.  Maybe.

## Going, to Varying Degrees of Boldness

I feel like the question about how seriously to take Picard's crew becomes important because, as mentioned, the "third generation" of the franchise centers almost entirely on **The Next Generation**.

- **Discovery** ended with an entire season that primarily serves as a sequel to [*The Chase*]({% post_url 2025-04-03-chase %}), and I'd bet that they originally planned for fragmented Federation of the future to serve as a sequel to [*Force of Nature*]({% post_url 2025-07-24-force-nature %}).
- **Picard**'s connection seems self-explanatory.
- **Lower Decks** draws on **TNG** for almost everything, from its design to its cast to individual episode plots, probably even more.
- **Prodigy** takes most of its cues from **Voyager**, but also has a season that mostly exists to follow up on [*Journey's End*]({% post_url 2025-10-09-journey-s-end %}).
- **Strange New Worlds**, as I have mentioned, feels like an attempt to reboot the original series to fit more cleanly with **TNG**, by drawing on it for philosophy and character personality.
- **Scouts** has characters that mimic the original series, but uses **TNG**'s design language.

If we---heck, if the *franchise*---fail to understand what has become the franchise's load-bearing show, then new shows will reify those mistakes, drifting further off-track as it compounds its misinterpretations.

Anyway, to close the book on this show, I mentioned this with the post for [*These Are the Voyages...*]({% post_url 2026-01-29-these-are-voyages %}), but I want to reiterate that, as the franchise has increasingly wanted (and needed) new audiences, it seems bizarre that nobody at Paramount has come up with a better idea in almost forty years---counting from **TNG**'s pilot when a series and continuations became a larger franchise---than exactly the same show, but with a different setting and/or labels for the captain.  They have an entire universe to play in, but keep going back to the same format.

I won't clutter this already-long post with it, but to illustrate the point, the February [newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) (click the ellipsis in the upper-right next to the *Login* link, then *Follow*), which will go out on March third, I propose seven(!) shows that go further than a military crew (that pretends to explore) and "shaking it up" by changing the setting and captain.  Two of them borrow actual characters from the franchise, and two take their inspiration from existing fiction.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when maybe we don't need to get this project back on track, because we have always been in the first half of *Emissary*, the **DS9** pilot.
