As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Psychological violence was the most common form of victimization reported, at 37.6%, followed by sexual violence (22.1%) and physical violence (19.5%).

While this seems obvious---abuse comes from people who want a power imbalance in their relationships, and so targeting vulnerable people fits right in with that---but more people should know the data.

I've never actually seen anything documenting these awards, so I appreciate seeing who got them, this round.

 > These two words seem to refer to two distinct goddesses in the earliest Hindu literature, the Vedas.

I hope those who celebrate had a great time.

I mean, I also hope those who *didn't* celebrate had a great time...

 > That same year, Dr. Nyanzi was arrested and charged with cyber harassment for insulting Museveni after she wrote and published a poem about the president's mother's vagina on her Facebook page.

I've surely said this before, but authoritarians always fight an uphill battle, because nobody likes their policies, and it doesn't take much to stand up to them.  By contrast, cooperative organizations adapt and have buy-in.

 > Immigration is not a crisis --- but the political, economic, and environmental factors that push people out of their homes are.

I know a lot of people who increasingly believe that almost all inter-group problems (ethnic, religious, etc.) come from AstroTurfing campaigns, set up to distract from class wars.  As Lyndon Johnson put it:

 > If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.

You notice that Republicans need to constantly juggle, in this space.  They want or need to divide people, for anybody to believe that their policies make any sense.  But they also want cheap labor to drive down wages and disrupt employee protections.  Therefore, they need people to want to crack down on immigration, but also to tolerate their lack of progress on the subject.  If they "solve" the "problem," then laborers have a stronger position, and they lose a cheap division.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Before Roe v. Wade There Was the Jane Collective](Before Roe v. Wade There Was the Jane Collective) from Voice of America

I frequently say that the existence of the Janes fifty years ago should make us optimistic for abortion rights.  People stepped up to illegally perform surgical "dilation and curettage" abortions.  Today, vacuum aspiration tools and pharmaceuticals can far more easily and safely terminate a pregnancy.  In the long term, that makes it almost impossible to actually stop people from getting abortions, no matter how clever legislators feel when enacting bans.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [What the Hell Is MAGACommunism?](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88qk4b/what-the-hell-is-magacommunism) from VICE Motherboard

 > Together, they decry the “vulgarization” of Marxism by Western liberals, traffic in the language of “deep-state” conspiracies, and mock “planet worshipers,” dismissing modern climate change efforts as virtue-signaling “green fascism” backed by corporate entities.

I wanted to call attention to this, because these dolts keep demanding that we not call them "Nazis" just because they *happen* to carry Nazi flags to rallies and insurrections.  Can we call them that, now that they identify as a nationalist socialist party?  Because it seems like they want to make their identification straightforward, here.
