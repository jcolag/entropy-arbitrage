Today is [World Water Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Water_Day), where the United Nations advocates for better management of freshwater sources.  Given how [water stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity) affects an increasing number of communities, it's worth at least considering where your water comes from and what's being done to protect it.

## Entropy Arbitrary

I posted a link to the new [repository for blog assets](https://gitlab.com/jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-assets) as mentioned last week.  I also added the script that I use to run a quick grammar and style check for posts, which probably won't work particularly well for anybody who isn't me, and have been cleaning up other scripts.

## Picture to Nonogram

I finally got around to squeezing out the issues in the JavaScript code generated by [**Picture to Nonogram**](https://github.com/jcolag/picture-nonogram) that might be flagged by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), reducing the chances that the output pages will trip anybody up in the future.

## CPREP

It looks *terrible* and has some minor bugs, but I finally added a primitive headshot generator to [**CPREP**](https://github.com/jcolag/background-generator).  The basic idea is that it models a skull as a curved octagon, where each side of the figure---accounting for bilateral symmetry---has a random size.

While it needs improvement, this provides head shapes that range from round to rectangular, to diamond-shaped, to triangular.  Throw in randomly generated eyes, nose, and (one day soon) mouth at the proper proportions, and it's at least a loose approximation of what a person might look like.

When I've previously considered doing this, I wanted to base it on a prior work.  Unfortunately, every approach I've seen to this is under a non-Free license, the closest being non-commercial.  This---again---isn't ideal, but it should be possible to massage this (for example, tweaking the proportions and adding cheekbones and a brow) to produce a cartoon headshot that mostly just lacks hair and any adornment.

Naturally---in multiple senses of the word---it would make more sense to model the subset of skull bones that are front-facing and build a face around those resulting contours.  But until I (or someone else) gets the motivation to do that, the octagon is probably fine.

## Next

I don't know if I have a good model to do it, yet, but I'd like to make some obvious improvements to the **CPREP** headshot, like adding actual lips, brows, cheeks, and a chin.

It might also be fun to take a closer look at the **Picture to Nonogram** data structure to find a way to provide hints.
