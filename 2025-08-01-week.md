As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Just what the world needed:  A calendar that flips the bird.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

As anecdotal confirmation that ants love this stuff, I recently swatted down a Lanternfly.  Within a couple of minutes, tiny ants had covered it and picked the bug's exoskeleton clean.  It reminded me a lot of the tank of flesh-eating beetles at my high school, where one of the teachers would bring in roadkill, but much smaller and faster...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114936648546911733) [PBS and NPR are generally unbiased, independent of government propaganda and provide key benefits to US democracy](https://theconversation.com/pbs-and-npr-are-generally-unbiased-independent-of-government-propaganda-and-provide-key-benefits-to-us-democracy-261512) from The Conversation

Hashtags:  #PBS #Democracy #PressFreedom #Media

Personally, I find NPR too corporate-style for my tastes, with a distinct preference for "some say" stories that always somehow end up bolstering right-wing views.  But when I watch news at all (as opposed to the online sources you see in these Friday posts), I exclusively watch the **PBS News Hour**.

And, as long as I feel like shilling for PBS, beyond news, they almost literally have something for everyone.  If you want low-budget reality programming, how-to, science, arts, culture, drama, mystery, cozy "comfort food" shows, or plenty of other types of show, they probably have something that you'll enjoy.  And if you donate enough that you can choose the gift[^1] of Passport, you get *decades* more material to watch.

[^1]:  Public television can't *sell* you anything, so you can't "subscribe" to their streaming service.  Instead, you donate and, at different tiers---and for some rewards, different times---they will send you a gift of your choosing.  Five bucks per month gives you access to their back-catalog to thank you for your support, in other words, not because you exchanged money for a premium streaming service...

Seriously, in the past two months, about one month into a year of my Passport gift, I have watched the films from an Afrofuturism festival, a bunch of Broadway shows, operas, ballets, a show about world mythologies, a documentary series about Asian Americans, dramatizations of entertainers and politicians, a show about World War II from the perspective of ordinary people in its way, a weird thing about wisdom in America, concerts in genres from country to jazz to show-tunes, the news, cooking shows, detective shows, popular science shows, and probably more that I have forgotten.  You can get the details in the [blog's newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), going out over the next few days.  Did I enjoy all of it?  No, like any streaming service, it has some hits and some misses.  And even the shows that I don't like, I usually at least find interesting.

In fact, calling back to something that I said in my [cord-cutting]({% post_url 2021-04-04-cord-cut %}) over four years ago, I have ended up dropping all the streaming services that I pay for, because I didn't find them worth the *time*, let alone the rising costs.  I now almost exclusively use PBS as the sole service that I pay for, library-sponsored services Hoopla and Kanopy, Peacock because it comes free from something else that I subscribe to, and occasionally dip into the ad-supported services.  And I believe that doing so has improved my mood, because I no longer need to "find something to watch" to justify having paid for Disney+.  Eventually, I may subscribe for an occasional month of something to catch up, but I said that about Netflix a couple of years ago and never bothered.

Ousting these creeps can't come soon enough.

I feel like I pointed this out recently, but shortly after the 2024 election, I wrote that [people who refused to vote for Harris owned every death]({% post_url 2024-11-10-election %}) caused by the then-upcoming Trump administration.  It doesn't matter what excuse you used.  The administration and its flunkies in Congress have decided that we should spend more money dealing with starvation than to feed poor people, and if you didn't actively vote against it, you made that happen.

You don't get to say that it serves them right for voting for this.  You don't get to say that this would never have happened if your favorite candidate had won years ago.

Like I said in the content warning, I really wish that this didn't try to go all-in on *Harry Potter* teaching people how to stand up to bigotry, especially in such detail after calling out a variety of franchises in the first paragraph.  And I have to admit that I immediately look down on anybody using the term "Elder Millennial" to describe their behavior.  But I suppose that the lessons at the bottom hold up...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Pham epitomizes inflated credentials and fabricated expertise. Affiliated with the Atlantic Council, he presents himself as a former diplomat, an Africa expert, and an ‚Äúauthor of more than 300 essays and reviews and the author, editor, or translator of over a dozen books.‚Äù In reality, his career is built not on expertise, but on the vacuum of scrutiny that surrounds Africa policy in Washington.

I remember a few years ago, when African authors started pointing out how the cover of every Western novel related to Africa in some way had the same cover concept, a barren landscape with a lone acacia tree slightly to the right.  This doesn't stray too far from that problem, because it comes from the same source that we get almost no information on Africa, so wealthy people can largely make up whatever they want and bill themselves as experts...

 > The Trump administration has set up a system ripe for abuse. It has used deportation procedures [to send migrants](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/18/2334063/-Some-deportees-are-leaving-El-Salvador-s-hellish-megaprison) to facilities like El Salvador‚Äôs brutal CECOT prison.

I know that it'll come as a huge shock to everybody that Donald Trump doesn't actually care about things that he can't use to hurt people or line his pockets.  He can't frighten you with Mexican drug-lords if fentanyl deaths decline, and he can't invade cities to deport refugees if they can't get into the country, so they'll gladly loosen border security.
