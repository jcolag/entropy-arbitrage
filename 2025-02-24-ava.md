In the absence of a useful holiday, today we (can) mark the 1365 founding of the [Kingdom of Ava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ava) (အင်းဝပြည်) in modern Myanmar.  Do I bring it up as an excuse to look at Burmese writing?  Maybe, but the kingdom forged alliances with neighbors and produced many significant works of literature, so I didn't do it *only* as an excuse to use Burmese script.

And on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the first.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the fourth of March.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For February, I wrote an update on the people-search sites, an update on shifting to PBS and library sites, discussed my media consumption, talked about an upcoming series of Sunday posts that I have in mind, and provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.  (Or maybe you haven't, because I got a bit lazy on updating things with the new year.)

At this point, the update to the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) font should have completed, with the following.

- More known URLs for federated social media servers,
- All Unicode code-points up to date,
- New icons added,
- Colors used in cases that posts will care about, and
- `text-shadow` styles added in cases where the contrast between the icon and background color seems too low.

Similar changes have also propagated to the embedded [Toot Pick](https://tootpick.org/) use of the Mastodon icon.

## Next

This week, I want to get back to Open Badges, especially dealing with the validation signatures.  You might also expect to see a more permanent solution to the icon font update changes, because I do *not* want to ever go through that again.  It looks like the Simple Icons CSS file---not remotely useful for the link annotations, but rather for the `<i class="icon-name"></i>` insertions directly into text---has a regular enough format that code could join that to a quick name-to-URLs mapping to generate what I need.
