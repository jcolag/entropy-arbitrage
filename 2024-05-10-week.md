As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > While the FBI explains that the Uniform Crime Report is not exhaustive, some researchers have indicated that the system specifically underreports hate crime data. In 2022, about 80% of participating agencies reported zero hate crimes, which diverges from other reputable data sources.

Hashtags:  #LGBT #HateCrimes

I realize that it becomes more difficult to pass *good* laws in hopes of stopping bad behavior, when the opposition would like to pretend that intent doesn't matter (and even if it *did* matter, they only acknowledge discrepancies in harm when causing the harm and not when fixing it), but we still need to push for better.

 > Meyer says that, for example, in Durham County, North Carolina, the false alarm rate for Black drivers ranges from 6 to 8% while the false alarm rate for white drivers is 3 to 4%. This equates to 11,000 Black drivers compared to about 2,500 white drivers who are searched while innocent.

As usual, I feel like everybody already knew this, *but* we now have numbers to gesture at when people try to tell us that we shouldn't believe in systemic racism.

 > Outside, the redundant rain added its unwelcome measure to the swollen and angry stream. In the ghostly gray dawn the grotesque wreckage of flood-time floated and whirled and jiggled by, seeming to bob a mad obeisance as it passed the show boat which, in its turn, made stately bows from its moorings.

 > Losing the ACP wouldn't only cut off these families --- it would undercut the financial viability of networks being planned under the Infrastructure Act's broadband deployment funding, causing providers to build less and leave more people behind.

Hashtags:  #ACP #USPol #Internet #DigitalDivide

We talk about the point that I quoted far too infrequently.  I benefitted greatly from the ACP for a while, but you could have also solved my problem---price versus income---by breaking up the concentrated market and re-enabling the competition that we've lost over the last couple of decades.  But competition driving down prices only solves *today's* problem, whereas the ACP also solves problems a few years out.

 > Ticketmaster/Live Nation loves the Fans First Act, because â€“ unlike other bills â€“ it focuses primarily on the secondary market for tickets, and its main measure is a requirement for ticketing companies to disclose their junk fees upfront.

Hashtags:  #Antitrust #Ticketmaster #USPol

Admittedly, I haven't gone to a concert in about twenty years---and my tastes probably run obscure enough that I don't need to worry about the secondary ticket market, if I went now---so I don't have *quite* the hatred for Ticketmaster that a lot of people do, but everything about the company has always felt terrible.  I'd compare them to companies like TurboTax, but geared towards extracting money primarily from teenagers and the elderly...

I should point out, here, that *many* fans of proprietary networks have bashed ActivityPub and the Fediverse for not having encrypted messaging, even though their platforms of choice often don't, either.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Opponents, including industry groups and Republican attorneys general, have raised concerns, and some have vowed to sue. They argue that the EPA has overreached its legal authority and is imposing crippling costs on the coal industry.

Good.  At this point, it feels like everyone using coal does so out of spite for society.  They'll claim unfair costs, as if they have a right to high profit margins.  They'll write Constitutional Fan Fiction about how agencies secretly don't have permission to make or enforce rules unless Congress passes a law telling them which rule to make.  And they'll claim that you can't run a power grid on anything other than coal, despite all evidence to everywhere that does exactly that...

 > The thing is: none of this is gone. Nothing about the web has changed that prevents us from going back. If anything, it's become a lot easier. We can return. Better, yet: we can restore the things we loved about the old web while incorporating the wonderful things that have emerged since, developing even better things as we go forward, and leaving behind some things from the early web days we all too often forget when we put on our rose-colored glasses.

I recently had a conversation where I had to admit that I don't have much nostalgia for "the old web."  That comes, in part, because I didn't see the early work as important or even long-lived; keep in mind that I watched the earliest websites give way to the dot-com bubble, after all.  For every story about the "magic" of early Google search, I have stories of it ignoring most of my query, no matter how much I annotated it.

Also, though, it comes from me finding---and now sometimes building, such as this blog---my little corners of the Internet where I get what I need and want.  Sure, I'd *like* working search engines, but not enough to run a YaCy instance...
