## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Homeward

It looks like **DS9** took the week off, so we don't have any updates over there since last episode.

Meanwhile, we might skip through a lot of this episode, since it has more of an interest in the sibling relationship.

 > Captain's log, stardate 47423.9. We have arrived at Boraal Two in response to an emergency distress call from Lieutenant Worf's foster brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has been stationed on the planet as a cultural observer.

I did warn you that Worf had another brother, kept secret from us---by which I mean they invented him for this episode---inbound.

 > **RIKER**: The distress call came in only four days ago. Why would Doctor Rozhenko have waited so long before sending it?

What, did Riker want to carefully plan the mission?  Seriously, did Worf land in the wrong universe at the end of [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %})...?

 > **RIKER**: Is there any danger to the ship?
 >
 > **DATA**: I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges as a result.

When you live in space, doesn't "random systems might crap out" fit the exact parameters of danger?  Or does Data mean that the ship will suffer no damage, in the sense that the replacement crew sent to bring the ship-full-of-corpses back home won't need to make any serious repairs?

 > **PICARD**: Very well. But regardless of this planet's immediate situation, we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimize the risk of contact with the inhabitants. You will go alone, Mister Worf, and I want to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as a Boraalan.

Ooh, an episode revolving around the Prime Directive.  I can't wait to see what wild interpretation they slap on it this time around...

 > **WORF**: Nikolai has a mind of his own. He attended Starfleet Academy, but he was unable to follow the rules. He left after one year. But he has many fine qualities. He is brilliant, persuasive. A natural leader.

Has anybody on this show ever given this kind of description, other than when they talk about historical figures?

Also, I feel like I should point out that "unable to follow rules" sounds like literally every leader this show has presented to us.

 > **NIKOLAI**: I would know that voice anywhere. Worf, is it really you? It's good to see you. You've changed a lot in four years.

I assume that everybody actually does recognize Nikolai as [Paul Sorvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sorvino), because he spent over sixty years---until his surprising death a couple of years ago---appearing in...pretty much everything.

 > **DOBARA**: It's too dangerous. The storms can occur without warning. If you're caught in one.

And if you recognize Dobara, then you do because [Penny Johnson Jerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Johnson_Jerald) plays her, and she would go on to debut the year after this episode as Kasidy Yates on **DS9**, recurring until the end of the series.  She has also had many acting jobs of probably more importance, but I'd call another *Star Trek* show the most likely place that readers here will recognize her from.

 > **PICARD**: I have no intention of compounding what you have done by committing another gross violation of the Prime Directive.

You'll notice that Picard has already landed on the Prime Directive meaning that they shouldn't help people.  Nikolai hasn't exposed anything about space travel and hasn't even altered their culture, unless Picard believes that he upholds some cosmic force that *needs* certain cultures to go extinct...but not his culture, which he'll fight to defend no matter what.

 > **NIKOLAI**: Captain, the Boraalans have a rich and beautiful culture, a deep spiritual life. They deserve the chance to survive. And isn't that what the Prime Directive was truly intended to do, to allow cultures to survive and grow naturally?
 >
 > **TROI**: Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensure non-interference.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: But aren't we interfering either way? If we take no action, it's a conscious decision to let the Boraalans die.

That gives us three widely divergent interpretations of their apparent central law.  And as Crusher points out, Troi's interpretation carries absolutely no meaning.

And we should probably compare this with the actual *statement of the law* in [*Bread and Circuses*]({% post_url 2021-01-28-bread %}), that they may not identify themselves or their mission, interfere with the **social development** of the planet, and make no references to outer space, other worlds, or more advanced civilizations.  None of their interpretations match up, which could happen because the law has changed substantially, but could also happen because they've never read it.

 > **PICARD**: We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive, and until that is changed there is no further course of action that we can take. Is that understood?

What does that even mean?  You'll notice that he doesn't bother to *state* this principle, leaving us hanging on what he thinks the law means.

 > **PICARD**: This is one of those times when we must face the ramifications of the Prime Directive and honor those lives which we cannot save.

Picard seems to think that watching the people die---from a safe distance and without looking any of them in the eye or acknowledging them as people, mind you---honors their lives, and doesn't make him look like a complete ghoul.

 > **PICARD**: You have the Bridge, Number One.

Also, Picard won't stay to honor them.

 > **RIKER**: Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase eighty-seven, warp five.

Oh, my mistake.  The ship won't even stay to watch the death of the world in the abstract.  They can't even delegate the honor...

 > **RIKER**: What happened?

Not to sound like a complete contrarian, here, but...who *cares* what happened?  Sure, the episode doesn't happen if Riker doesn't stop to investigate the question, but the world and everything on it will die momentarily, and a surprising explosion won't change that.

 > **WORF**: The power drain has registered on my security grid as well, sir. It appears to be coming from deck ten.

See, *that*, I can imagine them caring about, because it might become relevant to them later.  But they made it perfectly clear that they don't care about what happens on the dying planet.

 > **NIKOLAI**: I wasn't going to let those people die just because your Captain started quoting Federation dogma to me.

Heck, as I pointed out, Picard didn't even bother to quote the dogma, only briefly referenced it, and I still assume that he did so because he doesn't actually know what it says...

 > **PICARD**: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that we have another option. Very well, let's give it a try.

I've asked this before, but does the show *really* want us to like Picard?  He can't muster up any enthusiasm for *saving lives* while also upholding his alleged principles, and acts like condemning them to death on the surface would differ from executing them now.

 > **LAFORGE**: The plasmonic energy surges from the planet are affecting the ship's systems. We're having problems with the EPS systems and the power distribution matrix.

Wait, why haven't they left?  This seems like an entirely foreseeable problem, after all, given that Data explicitly said that they might occasionally lose systems.

 > **PICARD**: That will take hours.

They can't do this while the village sleeps?  Get Crusher to dig up some stage sets that, in the dark, will look close enough?

 > **PICARD**: Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't think it's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf will accompany you.

Again, he put them in "the situation" where they save a bunch of lives without breaking the law, at least the only version of the law that we actually know.  And what horrible thing does Picard think that he'll do, exactly, find more people to rescue?

 > **WORF**: We are not a team. I am here because Captain Picard ordered me here.

Who wants to tell him that you don't get to choose most teams in your life?  I mean, presumably he thinks of himself as part of the team with the rest of the *Enterprise* crew, even though he presumably didn't go out of his way to pick that posting.

 > **CRUSHER**: There are constant border disputes in that sector.

The telescope array in [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}) also sat three light years away from Cardassian space.  Did they draw the border to maximize the chances of disputes?

Actually, sit tight, because it occurs to me that this innocuous-sounding line might actually feed into upcoming episodes and an extended arc on **DS9**.

 > **DATA**: It offers a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans are accustomed to. However, it would still appear to be the better choice. Do you disagree, Doctor?

I have a question, then.  Why do they need to have this conversation at all?  They already knew that they would discard the planet that some other government might eventually claim as theirs, so why propose two choices when only one makes any sense?

 > **CRUSHER**: There are so many questions we don't have answers to. What if the climate is so different that it affects them in a way that we can't anticipate? How do we even know they'll be able to survive? And if they do, how will their society evolve and what impact will it have on the Vaccan system? We have no idea what this decision will mean to their future.

Honestly, I feel like the premise of this episode answers her question for her, no?  They developed an entire system to transport a (small) culture to another planet, and even primed this culture to accept any glitches as part of their salvation.  If the new planet tries to kill them, move them again, as long as the population doesn't grow too large to manage.

And yes, this would make a fine justification for the Prime Directive, that they can't afford to monitor every culture that they touch, to prevent their extinction.  But if they meant that, they should have *said* it.

 > **RIKER**: We can reach that in forty-two hours at maximum warp, sir.

You'll notice, we don't even get a mention of the environmental ramifications of "maximum warp," like we had last week in [*The Pegasus*]({% post_url 2025-08-14-pegasus %}).  And I'll grant you that this---minimizing the chances that their charges will learn about space travel from an outside source---does feel like more of an emergency than "the Romulans might dig up some of our used car," but it still seems strange that they don't even point this out.

 > **VORIN**: Stories change with each person who tells them. This, this will always be the same. Our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen generations. I was only able to save the last six. This shows the destruction of our village. This is you and Nikolai leading us to safety.

Sorry to drift into talking about the writing, and maybe they even meant it this way, but I wish that this idea had more of a bite to it, to tie it to the worst fans of the franchise, who show up for every installment to tell us that "this isn't *Star Trek*."  By this point, we already had *three* iterations of this.  Up until the last few years, fans hotly argued over whether the animated series "counted."  When this show aired, people bashed it for its daytime drama aesthetic, its recycled plots, and (more quietly) its ugly politics that we've talked about.  **Deep Space Nine** had detractors even *in this cast*[^1], plus all the people whining that you can't do *Star Trek* from a space station or without someone with the rank of Captain or with a Black guy in charge or through "darker" stories.

[^1]:  I roll my eyes so often at Jonathan Frakes, as he shows up so frequently in front of and behind the camera for this franchise, and talks about what the franchise means to him, largely because---after his own colleagues received threats for not doing *Star Trek* right---had the nerve to talk about how he didn't think that **DS9** fit the franchise, even as *they* received threats, because he wanted it to only tell (not his words) happy imperialist stories where the protagonists always make the right call no matter what call they make.

And this has continued.  **Voyager**, **Enterprise**, the Abrams-led batch of films, **Discovery** especially, and **Prodigy**, all prompted "fans" to vent their spleens for offering something in the fictional universe that didn't match their tastes or didn't adhere precisely to history as they remember it.  And I can't help noticing that the other shows in the modern slate have done what they could to have no politics and no significant social progress, instead leaning deeply into nostalgia.

I go through all that, because shows such as **Lower Decks** and **Strange New Worlds**, and the fans who rejected **Discovery** for "doing *Star Trek* wrong*," feel like Vorin, to me.  They don't want the story to ever change from the version that they grew up with.  They need the version that they know reified, so that we need to treat even the implausible appearance of the computers in the original series as factual information and not the best that the harried production team could do for a "dramatization" of those (fictional) facts on their budget.

Vorin would never read these blog posts, in other words, but he would have multiple browser bookmarks to pages in the Memory Alpha wiki...

 > **WOMAN**: Can I help you?

I love that he makes it all the way to the bar before anybody even notices that Vorin seems out of place.

 > **WORF**: Then you should have considered that before you beamed them on board. But you never think about the consequences of your acts.

Look, I come down on these people a *lot* for failing to do any advance planning, but short of reading the script, how the heck could Nikolai have come up with "but maybe my old lab will explode, causing the ship to linger, giving time for one of the unpredictable atmospheric disturbances to mess up the holodeck systems, so that it becomes much more difficult to keep everybody on task, and then one of them will accidentally walk out of the simulation"?

And given that they only had this option and condemning those few survivors to death, what makes Worf think that he would've made a different choice if he *had* seen this coming?

 > **LAFORGE**: We'll be there in less than eight hours. You're just going to have to hold things together a little while longer.

...Problem solved, then, right?  They want to set camp, so let them eat, then sleep the rest of the way there.

 > **DOBARA**: Yes. I want you to consider yourself my brother. After all, you're going to be the uncle of my child.

Thank goodness that we don't have time left in the episode for the crew to argue about whether baby-making counts as interference in society.

 > **PICARD**: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or that you're insane.

Picard really seems to want to taunt the poor guy.  And he can't help denigrating people with psychiatric problems.

 > **WORF**: That is not possible. I cannot allow you to stay here.
 >
 > **NIKOLAI**: You will have to kill me first.

This reminds me of [**The Motion Picture**]({% post_url 2022-03-10-tmp %})'s novel, where Kirk suggests that Starfleet chose his cohort for their lesser intellectual capacity, because prior officers had a tendency to find alien cultures superior to what the Federation had to offer and defect.

 > **CRUSHER**: I think it was some form of ritual suicide.
 >
 > **PICARD**: He said that he had nowhere to go.

Ah, we finally have the big difference between this show and the original.  Kirk talked evil computers into destroying themselves.  Picard goes after underprivileged kids...

 > **PICARD**: No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But I wish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. I would have liked the chance to have known him better.

"Our plan," he says.  Truly, [success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/success_has_many_fathers,_failure_is_an_orphan)...

Also, "bridge the gap," as in interfere with another culture?  Compare this, by the way, to an episode like [*First Contact*]({% post_url 2024-02-15-first-contact %}), where we saw that the Federation infiltrates and manipulates these young societies so that they can avoid dealing with unfriendly cultures expanding into interstellar space.

 > **WORF**: No. If you had been more like me, these people would not be here now. You gave them a chance at a new life.

It took them long enough to get there, but at least Worf---it always seems to fall to Worf or Crusher, doesn't it?---seems to understand that only one person did this, in defiance of everybody else telling him to let them die.

## Conclusions

This episode mostly focuses on the sibling rivalry, but in the cracks, we get some useful information.

### The Good

Riker seems to have gotten onto a mild improvement program where he at least acknowledges the value of preparing for things.

### The Bad

Data seems to not think that interrupting ship systems at random would put anybody in danger, or doesn't think that the danger to the crew would get included in dangers to the ship.  He also presents solutions that he knows won't work as possible alternatives to the more natural solution.

Maybe related, the crew has gone back to seeming completely incompetent.  Riker stops their exit from a dangerous situation to check on a random explosion on a dying world, as if it'll change anything.  And when a baffled foreigner wanders the halls, the crew alternates ignoring him and looking irritated that he got in the way of their walk.

And they continue to not seem to know what the Prime Directive directs them to do, continuing to settle on not helping foreigners in distress, though some use not acting as a fuzzy euphemism.  They seem to go so far out of their way to not talk about the text or requirements, that it gives a strong impression that they have no idea what it even says.  But they will sit and watch the masses die on screen to "honor" them...except that they wander off in the middle of the show, so they also don't do that.  And they seem incredibly angry about rescuing people.

The crew seems to have already abandoned the "warp speed limit," or feel comfortable making the call on whether a situation qualifies as an emergency.  But they also seem surprisingly unwilling to work around the village's biological needs to make their repairs and get to where they need to go, insisting that they can't find a few hours when nobody would notice the simulation shutting down.

Picard seems to go out of his way to convince his "pet" foreigner to take his own life, and only really regrets it because he might have become useful in future relations.  But he does have plenty of time for ableist slurs.

And we see that not everybody in the Federation sees it as the best possible home, and have no problems defecting to a less-developed culture.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Crusher picks up a guy at her grandmother's funeral, taking pity on him, because (sorry...but also not) he ain't got no body, in *Sub Rosa*.
