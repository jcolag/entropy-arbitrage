## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## The Game

This episode will hurt, unfortunately.  Not even our impressive guest can fix a clunker that simultaneously wants to simultaneously play into the moral panic around video games and pitch Wil Wheaton as a leading man...

 > **RIKER**: Etana? I know you're back there. Don't make me come after you. Give me that.

Ten-to-one, they've done this running around for his entire vacation, but he'll *talk* about how much sex that he had, when he gets back...

 > **ETANA**: Go get it.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I don't believe you did that.

I guess that he doesn't care about the disposition of his work computer...

 > **ETANA**: Your reward for clearing the first level.

I blame this episode for creating social media...

 > **RIKER**: It's starting to get busy around here. Five new science teams just beamed in from the *Zhukov*. Quarters are filling up fast.

The *Zhukov* got a mention in [*Hollow Pursuits*]({% post_url 2023-09-21-hollow-pursuits %}) and [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %}), so you can read about [Georgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov) (Георгий Жуков) and his (alleged) obsession with smuggling Coca-Cola into the Soviet Union by camouflaging it as vodka in the latter post.

 > **PICARD**: On top of everything, there's been a change. We've been given only two weeks to complete the exploration.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Two weeks? That's not enough time to explore a region that size. I thought we had five weeks.

While we could imagine that Starfleet values the *Enterprise* so much in diplomatic missions that they had no other choice, cutting a mission like this by sixty percent, despite the overhead of loading and unloading teams from across the Federation.  But it seems more likely that they either have insufficient people and ships, or they don't consider this exploratory mission at all important.

 > **PICARD**: Oh, and one piece of good news, we're to rendezvous with a shuttlecraft carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from the Academy.

OK, but when do we get to hear the *good* news...?

 > **LAFORGE**: You know Robin Lefler.

As I mentioned in [*Darmok*]({% post_url 2024-05-23-darmok %}), you may recognize Lefler as a young Ashley Judd, who has gone on to do much better for herself than this episode...

 > **TROI**: Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like.

Ah, the depth of character that they've given the counselor...

 > **TROI**: Of course it does, but it's not just a matter of taste. It's the whole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around the rim, leaving only ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon the ice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it. Relish every bite. Make every one an event. And then, with the last spoonful, close your eyes.

Did...they try to make this scene *sexy*?  If so, why?

 > **RIKER**: I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate.
 >
 > **TROI**: Oh? What is it?
 >
 > **RIKER**: Just a game.

Way to sell it, Commander.  And yet...Troi seems far too excited about this pathetic excuse for a prospect.

 > **PICARD**: Oppido bonum. Your Latin has improved.

Why would Starfleet Academy teach Latin...?  No, really, I ask for two big, maybe-related reasons.  First, I see no benefit in teaching a dead Earth language to students who will presumably soon need to deal with an abundance of languages that bear absolutely no relationship to Latin.  Second, and maybe more important to our overall project, fascists tend to see their projects as continuations or revivals of the Roman Empire---as in, who do you think ran the "first Reich" that certain German nationalists got so excited about a century ago?---and so carrying that interest into the distant future seems worrying.

Or maybe this has nothing to do with fascism.  After all, one other organization has regularly obsessed over Latin in the modern era, the Catholic Church.  Perhaps instead of seeing fascism, the Federation represents a Catholic state, in a timeline where the [Second Vatican Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council) didn't allow for substituting vernacular language in Mass.  That would fit with Spock pulling out so many Biblical references in the original series.  Doesn't that make you feel cozier...?

 > **WORF**: Wesley. Tarvokian pound cake. I made it myself.

I'd like to point out that this little line makes Worf far more interesting than Troi's ode to chocolate, earlier, did for her...

 > **DATA**: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes, several of which I fell victim to.

Much like Starfleet possibly presenting itself as an arm of a revived Roman Empire, it seems like the continued presence of interpersonal pranks should prompt some concern.  The most charitable explanations for practical jokes suggest that you use them to "humble" the target, or in other words to make them feel worse about themselves.  And again, that qualifies as a *charitable* reading, whereas other descriptions outright call it bullying, especially when targeting someone---such as Data---who won't share the joke in the aftermath.

 > **DATA**: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an Academy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance?

Wow.  I have a headache, and we haven't even gotten to the main plot...

OK, a [Sadie Hawkins dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Hawkins_dance) derives from a 1937 [**Al Capp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%27l_Abner) comic strip, and posits a topsy-turvy world where women and girls can ask men and boys to escort them.  Let me rephrase that for clarity:  For this single event, women may ask men out on dates.  And why do I need to deal with this nonsense?

First, once again, all culture in the Federation derives directly from the 1930s.  Now go back a few quotes and tell me that I over-reacted to the use of Latin, if we connect it to that decade...

Second, and far more importantly, Sadie Hawkins doesn't make *any* sense as a character, unless you have a culture that expects women to passively serve as nothing more than prizes for men to claim and win.

 > **WESLEY**: The Dancing Doctor? She tried to teach me too, but I just don't have the knack.

We now officially know that we have Wesley back, because nobody has tried to undermine Crusher in a long time, but he makes sure to spread a nickname that she knows makes her uncomfortable, as we learned in *Data's Day*...

 > **WESLEY**: You're kidding. The computer has to do this.

You know, I skipped over Wesley feeling entitled to a big welcome, but now that he whines about the prospect of doing even the tiniest amount of labor on his own, I guess that we can't skip the rant about his constantly acting like a self-entitled snot.

Honestly, I don't know if I've brought this up before---apologies if I did---but I might as well say it here:  When the show aired, fans *hated* Wesley, but they did so for exactly the wrong reason.  They didn't like that they gave him Roddenberry's middle name and made him a genius who'd save the day.  And while I'd call that a flaw in the *show*, that has nothing to do with the character, because they could've done the same with Riker, and everybody would've probably taken it in stride.

No, everybody *should* have hated Wesley for his utter self-absorption, his racism, his sexism, his mindless devotion to Picard that *certainly* won't become a major plot point for us to deal with in September, and maybe most importantly the show elevating him as some sort of example, up until that devotion ends.

 > **WESLEY**: He didn't remember you, sir. At first. I found an old yearbook photo, and he remembered you right away. He said he's very proud of you that you're Captain of the Enterprise.

Oh, hey, Picard has his self-entitlement issues, too, expecting a groundskeeper to remember him after, what, thirty years?  I went to a tiny college that has since closed, rather than a military academy, and speaking as someone fairly close to Patrick Stewart's age when this aired, I'll tell you that it would please me to no end if the staff at my college remembered me, but it would also impress me to no end, given how many other people they needed to work with, before, during, and since my time there.

 > **WESLEY**: Sir, what do the initials A F stand for?

[No comment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AF#Adverb).

 > **WESLEY**: Boothby said he caught you carving those initials into his prized elm tree.

Apparently, we'll quietly gloss over the fact that young Picard took it upon himself to deface school property and potentially cause environmental damage along the way.  Seriously, maybe only in my part of the world, but even in 1991, that sort of thing felt crass, and only really the sort of pseudo-affection that you'd get from the sort of teenager who thinks that they need to carry a knife around at all times.

And OK, *one* comment on the initials:  I can absolutely see Picard as the sort of kid who'd run off on his own with a knife, then pat himself on the back for marking a landmark tree as "Jean-Luc AF."

 > **WESLEY**: You have a funny way of looking at conduit configuration, but it works.

Ugh.  Did Wesley invent [negging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negging), here?  Worse, did this episode train a generation of television viewers to believe that insulting a woman would make Ashley Judd like you...?

 > **LEFLER**: No. But I'll meet you for dinner.

...*Why*?

Seriously, we've seen him do nothing but complain about people not showering him with sufficient praise, so either his insults somehow worked or he did something endearing that I missed...

 > **CRUSHER**: No. Wesley, you are on vacation. You have done enough already.
 >
 > **WESLEY**: Yeah, maybe you're right. Computer, increase light level.

It took Wesley exactly one "maybe you should relax" to completely abandon his comatose friend.

 > **LEFLER**: When your parents are the only plasma specialists in the sector, you do a lot of travelling around. We went from base to base to base. I felt like a piece of luggage after a while. I spent all of my time around technical gear. My first friend was a tricorder.

This seems to give some indication of the Federation's economic conditions, if a "plasma specialist" spends their entire life as what sounds like an itinerant laborer without attracting any competition in the region.

 > **WESLEY**: Really? My very first friend was a warp coil.

That probably happened, because he treats warp coils with far more respect than he does any actual people.  Also, speaking of respect...what did they dress him in?  He seems to have a mock turtleneck with corduroy neck, shoulder pads or epaulets, and cuffs.

 > **LEFLER**: It's stimulating the septal area.
 >
 > **WESLEY**: That's the pleasure center of the brain. Whatever this thing does, it must feel pretty good.

The [septal area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septal_area) does, in fact, exist.

 > **WESLEY**: The game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of the brain. Now I know that's nothing conclusive, but it could explain why everyone is so attracted to it. And at the same time, it stimulates the brain's reasoning center. I don't know what that's all about.

That...doesn't sound bad.  "It feels good and makes you think" would make for high praise in almost any other context, but here they seem to want to use video games to draw yet another drug metaphor.  And the Federation does appear to still conduct the War on Drugs, most recently poking its head out in [*Night Terrors*]({% post_url 2024-02-29-night-terrors %}).

 > **WESLEY**: She said no thanks.

Look, we all know that I don't like Wesley and *why* I don't like Wesley, but grabbing Lefler's wrist to angrily drag her out of a situation that she already resolved feels *way* creepier than it needed to.  Especially combined with his "affectionate" insults above, not to mention his "abandon your people so that we can run away together, and you can rely on me for everything" pitch back in [*The Dauphin*]({% post_url 2023-01-26-dauphin %}), makes me half-wonder if we never see Lefler for far more scandalous reasons than Judd having a far more successful career ahead of her...

 > **PICARD**: Welcome, Etana. The *Enterprise* has been secured. We await your further instructions.

Good to see that ships have literally no safeguards against someone taking over the crew.  Otherwise, they'd need to take computer security seriously, and we all know *that* would never happen...

 > **ETANA**: The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you will rendezvous with the starship *Endeavour*. Proceed with distributing the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counselor Troi, take a shuttle to Starbase sixty-seven. Distribute the device to all starships currently docked there.

The *Endeavor* last got a mention way back in [*Amok Time*]({% post_url 2020-08-13-amok %}), which probably takes its name most directly from the now-retired [space shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour), which NASA introduced about six months prior to this episode airing, even though it wouldn't fly for another six or so.

 > Captain's log, stardate 45212.1. We have delivered the Ktarian vessel to Starbase eighty-two and are now on a course to rendezvous with the Starship *Merrimack*, which will transport Wesley Crusher back to Starfleet Academy.

The *Merrimack* last appeared in [*Sarek*]({% post_url 2023-10-05-sarek %}), similarly taking the guest star back home.  Actually, given next week's episode, I wonder whether they chose the ship deliberately.  Now that I think about it, the *Endeavour* also vaguely connects, too.

 > **LEFLER**: Here. A gift, so you'll remember. Robin's Laws. All one hundred and two of them.

She seems to have printed them out on extremely rough paper, then bound them in some sort of plastic box.  It almost seems impressive.

 > **WESLEY**: A couple of light years can't keep good friends apart. Bye.

Sure, but tens of thousands of light years probably would, and that seems like the more typical scenario for the *Enterprise*.

## Conclusions

We see what passes for fashion, which I can only describe as "anything goes."  Paper, or something like it, also seems to exist for communication.

### The Bad

We see people act careless with official equipment when off-duty.  Maybe related, everybody seems *so* bored with their jobs, on the eve of allegedly one of their most exciting and now stressful projects, that merely telling them that a new game exists will cause them to leap at the opportunity to try it.

Based on what we see at Starfleet Academy, regressive Earth culture seems to have a strong sway over the populace.  They teach Latin.  People expect women to take passive roles in relationships, except at certain exceptional times, and including when receiving "affectionate" insults.  They dismiss bullying as camaraderie.  Students get to deface school property without consequences.

We see a return to trying to diminish a female doctor's accomplishments, because she also does other things, sometimes.

Wesley and Picard both show how much the culture indulges self-entitlement, where at least people of a certain class expect that everyone will welcome and remember them at all times, and that they'll only get assigned the most interesting work available at any given time.  Wesley also completely abandons a close friend in a medical crisis, because he'd rather relax before his date, but does manhandle said date instead of trusting her to step away from a bad situation on her own.

Ships don't appear to have any failsafe systems for when the crew abandons their mission.

## Next

Come back in a week, when somebody considers the possibility of boosting ratings by bringing back a fan-favorite character in the franchise, in *Unification, part 1*.
