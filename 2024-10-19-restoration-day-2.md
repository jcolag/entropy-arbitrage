This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **Restoration Day**, from *Recognition* to *Chemistry*.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Restoration Day**
 * Location:  <https://deborah.makarios.nz/restoration-day/>
 * Released:  2018
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Deborah Makarios](https://deborah.makarios.nz/)
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately one hundred two thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Danger, fictional profanity

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Restoration Day

The author describes the book as follows.

 > Princess Lily was born to be queen, but she leads a pawn’s existence in the shadow of her guardians’ control. She dreams of the day when she will take her rightful place in the world.
 >
 > At last her chance arrives, with a quest for the three Requisites of Restoration Day, the royal rite which renews the life of the land. But she’s been hidden away too long, and Arcelia has changed.
 >
 > Stripped of everything but the identity which has become a life-threatening liability, Lily will need to do more than cross the board if she is to emerge triumphant as the queen she knows she must be. The land she thought was hers becomes the field for a gripping game—and this time she’s playing for her life.

Beyond that, you know what I know, at this stage.  I don't [follow Makarios on Mastodon](https://theres.life/@DMakarios), but following Free Culture-related tags means that I do see posts related to her books from time to time.

## What Works Well?

The bickering relationship between Lily and Malin occasionally stumbles, but brings a lot of fun to an otherwise bleak section of the story.  If the story had much interest in traditional gender roles---I feel grateful that it doesn't---I'd compare it to [screwball comedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwball_comedy), due to the entertaining conflict and the focus on the young woman.

Likewise, the escape delighted me, with how it felt carefully constructed, with real senses of space and stakes.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

After the great opening of the book that managed to get everything across without any direct exposition, this section (nearly) starts with a few pages of an "as you already know..." conversation between two characters, about details that *we* already knew or have figured out.  I can't imagine anybody getting this deep into the book and not realizing that Aunt Hortensia---one of the two (out of five) characters who gets much background or personality---serves as regent to crown princess Lily.  You might not have known the *word*, but you had to have worked out the relationship that the word describes.  In any case, we get a few scenes of outright "let's explain the situation," which all feel unnecessary, for the most part.

And I realize that we haven't gotten too far into the story, and she presumably has an entire character arc ahead of her, but Lily's naïveté feels contrived.  In a few scenes, it feels almost like a character describing a fantasy, spinning an elaborate explanation for events that we can see don't pan out that way.  In a couple of cases, this ties in with the sudden interest in explaining the world, too, as we get the character's detailed internal thoughts on a situation, instead of watching her reactions to them, letting those reactions speak for her.

## Opportunities

Other than paying for the books and leaving (kind) comments, I don't see many options.

## What's Adaptable?

This section introduces Pruning Day and its traditions, 

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll wrap up "sampling" **Restoration Day**, reading *A Place of Safety* and *Hidden Worth*.  If you get to *Story and Song*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book so far?
