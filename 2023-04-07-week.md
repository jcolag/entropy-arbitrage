As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

For anybody who wants the details, a company tried to get me to click on an e-mail for a hybrid almond-walnut, and another tried the same for compost-scented soap.  And while, sure, I'll tolerate their "pranks" on their own websites, I don't need it delivered to me.

In order to retain the spirit, but not butcher anybody's language or privilege one language over another, I'll wish a rather literalist sweet Passover to all celebrating it, this week.  Although, should we start calling it Pesach, like normal adults who acknowledge non-European cultures...?

It goes to show how weak even they see themselves, doesn't it?  After spending untold sums of money to capture the Supreme Court to [protect dark money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC), over twenty years revitalizing moves to suppress voting, a bit more than a decade to [capture state legislatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP), and more.  But even with all those advantages---effectively cheating, in any other context---they *still* can't win, and now want to give themselves the right to overrule what their constituents vote on.

Don't get me wrong.  I still consider them dangerous.  But I consider them dangerous in the same way that I consider a wounded animal dangerous, lashing out in hopes of doing enough damage to escape, rather than because it has the superior position.

 > Women who make sexual misconduct complaints often experience organizational and third-party retaliation for reporting misconduct, which can take a severe toll on their well-being. In contrast, men accused of engaging in sexual misconduct rarely experience transfers or terminations and are less likely to be terminated or resign than their victims.

When I used to regularly [write on Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}), I often repeated the idea---I forget where I picked it up---that we treat men like protagonists, women like members of the supporting cast or, worse, props.  Therefore, while I find studies like this important, I also disagree with the interpretation of their findings, to a significant extent, or at least their interpretation.

Specifically, I see no problem with extending sympathy to someone accused of hurting someone, because humans empathize and need empathy.  I see the problem in the *lack* of sympathy extended to more vulnerable people in general, particularly their accusers.  We need to treat *everybody* like a protagonist, because we don't live in a world with a supporting cast.

As a confession, I *hate* that bigots have put me in a position of defending drag.  My admittedly limited experience with drag acts has suggested that they fall less into "fun camp" and more into "repulsive misogyny played off as ironic," so I'd just as soon ignore it.  Yet even *I* can see---and could, before people started writing about it---that they wrote this to send cops out to harass anybody who doesn't appear to strictly conform to an imagined gender binary.

I wonder how far this path former colonizers will go.  The world needs it, so that we can move on, but you know that once one country bends, people will force the rest of the world to follow.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > From the Board‚Äôs perspective, it is essential that listeners on audio devices have an opportunity to learn about the trusted source of their information, especially when it comes from our movement and is contributed by thousands of volunteers.

I don't use voice assistants, so I'll probably never hear the sound logo again, but I do like it.  And it raises interesting questions as to what kinds of organizations will probably need such logos in the future.  Many traditional media outlets have something similar, which plays over their logo, often a mini-jingle with only a couple of notes, but this seems like new ground, in some ways.

 > ...children in families getting SNAP benefits in 2020 did not generally experience any change in their mental or emotional health compared to prior years, despite the heavy stress of the pandemic.

Once again, it turns out that, when we give families money, the children in those families have fewer problems.  An outside observer might *almost* conclude that a lack of money causes deep and lasting problems in a capitalist economy, and that we should probably fix that.

 > Civil War veteran and policeman William H. West, a Black man, was sent to investigate reports of speeding carriages.

Corporate media keeps telling us how "unprecedented" they find charging a former President of the United States with crimes, showing that they either didn't bother to do the most central research to that assertion *or* oppose prosecuting people who they find more important than the rest of us.  I'll let you decide for yourself which side they land on.

Unrelated:  Now that I weigh embedding article images in these posts, I increasingly hate how many of these outlets---even media outlets that broadly commit to Free Culture content, such as Kos's public domain default license---pay Getty for images.  It leads to inane situations like this, where I can't include a photograph from **1864**, which should have fallen into the public domain a long time ago, because someone poorly colorized it, and Getty claims a false copyright on everything that it touches.

If you appreciate this sort of content, then you should probably [follow me <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/) to get it as early as possible...and feel free to reply, at least to the good stuff.
