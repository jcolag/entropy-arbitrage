As with my recent post about [dystopia talking about the present]({% post_url 2025-11-09-look-around %}), this post doesn't feel like something that I should need to write, and I want to keep this short[^hHk1f7].  I have said it all many times before, and everybody should pretty much already understand it.  And yet...

[^hHk1f7]:  I especially want to keep it short, because I needed to talk about some of this *for* the post about dystopia.  Such books that resonate well in the United States draw directly from the problems at the time, so you could see this post as the other half of that.

Over the past week or so, two stories have broke related to the far-right in the United States, and I get the sense from articles and social media that people have rushed to take away the wrong lesson.

![Zebras grazing in the foreground while monstrous creatures in shadow approach from the distance](/blog/assets/Unknown-Species.png "Missing the Super PAC for the extraterrestrial dinosaur-things crushing the trees...")

First, people started reading Jeffrey Epstein's e-mails and noted [his connections with the Israeli government {% cc by-nc-nd %}](https://fair.org/home/emails-reveal-epsteins-ties-to-mossad-but-corporate-media-looked-away/).  This has led to many repulsive anti-Semitic ah-ha moments about how some dirty foreigners had probably blackmailed the United States conservatives into its Islamophobic positions and got the media to ignore it.  Yep.  In 2025, we have professional people, claiming to support liberal-to-progressive causes, talking about how "the Jews" control the media and secretly dominate the world, *literally* two out of the three most common [political anti-Semitic canards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_trope#Political_tropes) in history, alongside Great Replacement Theory.

Then, we got accidental confirmation from {% x %} that a lot of "America First" [right-wing content on social media comes from countries](https://www.404media.co/americas-polarization-has-become-the-worlds-side-hustle/) such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, and Russia.  And people have seen this and concluded that, ah-ha, these countries have targeted us for [psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare)[^kaUGrJ] and used social media as their weapon of choice.  Yes, we have serious people telling us that we don't have a xenophobia problem, because the *dirty foreigners* have put us under siege.

[^kaUGrJ]:  I do have to chuckle at how many people waving this evidence around now, if you remember back almost a decade ago, insisted that Russian disinformation had nothing to do with electing Donald Trump in 2016, even as the [Paul Manafort trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort,_2018) revealed that Sanders chief strategist [Tad Devine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tad_Devine) also worked on the Ukrainian presidential campaign of right-wing [Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)...a campaign that prominently featured the predecessor to the "lock her up" chant referring to [Yulia Tymoshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko).

Congratulations, we have managed to convince liberals to endanger the lives of Jewish and non-American folks, because---exactly like conservatives---the country can't look itself in the mirror, candidly confront our history, and admit that we don't *need* [outside agitators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_agitator) to careen into fascism.

## Not Who We Are

Sure, countries such as Russia do often [exploit existing polarization {% cc %}](https://www.ft.com/content/b9ab01f9-e654-44c8-a562-bd97630cab5e) in hopes of weakening the obstacles to expanding their influence.  But they can't exactly exploit existing polarization if that polarization doesn't...well, *exist*.

Let's not forget that every single country in the Western Hemisphere exists because an imperial power ignored native populations to claim that they "discovered" the place, then took on ethnic cleansing and/or forced labor campaigns against those natives who somehow didn't know about the local continents before the invaders.  In the United States, we expanded on that by inventing chattel slavery.  The entire world has had different forms of slavery, and the whole Western Hemisphere engaged in plantation systems, but Americans uniquely decided to own and raise humans as livestock for centuries of wage theft.  We fought a war over whether to expand that system west (as we drove the native populations off the land that we promised to leave alone for them), and when the war put an end to that and the practice of chattel slavery, we spent about ten years trying to fix the underlying problems and then shrugged our shoulders, so that we could squeeze out another century of pretending that slavery still existed.

Heck, the entire world has had thousands of years of misogyny as a central, load-bearing societal structure.  You don't even need to go further back in history than two hundred fifty years to reach a world where democracy didn't exist in any meaningful form (almost) *anywhere*.

And going local again, as I mentioned in the post about dystopia stories, we had plenty of leaders such as [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) and [Prescott Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush) who supported the Nazis, and their kind [tried to overthrow democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot).  None of that even tries to get to the part where we [denied Asians entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) to the country for decades, including falsely [accusing them of sex work and other crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875).  Or even in my lifetime, we could talk about the time that police actually [bombed a residential neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_MOVE_bombing), because the city escalated from noise and sanitation complaints, and we watched that story vanish from the news after a few days.

Seriously, I could go on for a *long* time, here, between atrocities that we inherited as we colonized North America and those atrocities that we committed for ourselves.  Every country does.

Speaking as somebody who loves this country, we can't pretend that every problem comes from mysterious foreign influences.  Every country has inherited and committed atrocities, but only healthy nations deal with them.  Early on in the blog's run, I referred to making this choice as [Turd Theory]({% post_url 2020-03-01-electability %}), where responsible people clean soiled surfaces before worrying about blame.  Or as [G.K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton) put it in [*A Defense of Patriotism*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Defendant/A_Defence_of_Patriotism)...

> "My country, right or wrong," is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case.  It is like saying, "My mother, drunk or sober."  No doubt if a decent man's mother took to drink he would share her troubles to the last; but to talk as if he would be in a state of gay indifference as to whether his mother took to drink or not is certainly not the language of men who know the great mystery.

We need to come to terms with our own history and clean house, so that we don't need to keep slogging through this garbage.  When given the choice, we frequently opt for, as bell hooks put it, imperial white supremacist patriarchy.  We opt otherwise more often than a lot of cultures have and do---hence my loving the country---but we still have a lot of work to do to sober up.

## Listen to Yourself

Even if you did want to go through this time and again, for whatever reason, learning nothing and improving even less, doesn't it maybe trigger your Spidey-sense to rhetorically attack the Trump administration with accusations of involvement with the latest update of [Jewish space-lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene#Camp_Fire_conspiracy_theory)[^Hhu5dz] and hand-wringing about [invading armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_invasion)?  Have white nationalists gained so much credibility that their notional political opponents fundamentally agree with them?

[^Hhu5dz]:  I get to say this as Greene flees Congress, because she dared disagree with Il Generalaccio, and quickly discovered that the receiving end of threatened stochastic terror doesn't spark nearly as much joy as the inciting end, such as suggesting that devious Jewish people start wildfires.

In addition, even if you don't mind (or approve of) *that*, then consider the countries fingered by {% x %}'s reveal of user locations.  Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, and Russia have something specific in common:  We offshore jobs to exactly those countries to take advantage of poor labor protection and weak currencies.  And [Astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing) comes right out of the United States, deployed most prominently over the years by [Big Tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry_playbook) as part of an entire slate of disinformation tactics.  In other words, a random troll from Vietnam has a better chance of doing so for grocery money[^_yz6tj] than out of actual support for right-wing policies and deep interest in electing Trump.  And they have more of a chance of getting their orders from Steven Miller or Jeff Bezos than Vladimir Putin.

[^_yz6tj]:  At the risk of hypocrisy by pointing to foreign campaigns, if "somebody paid them to support the party line" sounds far-fetched, bear in mind that the Chinese Communist Party has employed their [Five Dimes Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party) for almost twenty years with a [Taiwanese rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1450_Internet_army), and since then so does almost [every other major country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_Internet_propaganda), to say nothing of corporate shills.  All to say that you can get people to amplify your propaganda fairly cheaply.

Granted, letting the far right set the vocabulary for every situation has itself become an American tradition.  We call anti-abortion activists "pro-life," even as they also work to undermine public health and safety after birth...and also they don't even care about fetuses, considering [Amy Coney Barrett extreme for opposing IVF](https://truthout.org/articles/amy-coney-barrett-signed-anti-abortion-letter-from-extremist-group-against-ivf/) because *their* disposal of embryos doesn't have a squishy human coating to harass.  Even if we haven't reverted to their more dehumanizing language (yet), we now routinely refer to foreign nationals seeking to enter the country as [migrants](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/migrant), a term that we use for those who we have no obligation to help because they have economic or preferential motivations, rather than [refugees](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refugee) or asylum-seeker, who we do, under [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum).  Or beyond terminology, think about how often you've heard somebody assure you that we *certainly* don't want open borders, though they can't really tell you why, without quoting some white nationalist or other.

That list goes on seemingly forever, so it doesn't really *surprise* me that people have picked up on right-wing interpretations to apply to these new situations, but it definitely disappoints me.

## Opportunities

By the way, I don't want to downplay the potential benefits or the dangers, here.

I fully believe that we should use Epstein as a cudgel with which to pound everybody remotely connected with him, and anybody connected with those people who hasn't explicitly denounced them.  And I share the distaste for many of the Israeli government's actions, largely following the lead of many (though not all) of the Jewish folks in my life over the years.  If the two combine to slow down or stop the [Millennialist nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism) that "supports Israel" in hopes of sacrificing Israelis in some grand metaphysical conflagration to force their savior to come back[^NXD-We], I'd call it a win.  But when the conclusions start to converge on verbatim Nazi propaganda, *maybe* tug on the reins to slow the sleigh-ride down, because we already know that path doesn't end with a country standing on the right side of history.

[^NXD-We]:  Only the far-right press seems to have reported it, so I won't link to any articles, but about a year ago, somebody asked House Representative [Don Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bacon) (R-NE, as the journalists say) about Israel on {% x %}, and he responded "Read [Revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) and report back."  I also chose not to link to the articles, because most of them would rather whine that Bacon didn't use any of the more formal names of the text...

Likewise, it makes perfect sense to want to eliminate the actual foreign agitation.  We need to deradicalize the people supporting right-wing politicians and policies against their (and everybody else's) interests, so removing incendiary influences can only help.  No matter who pulls their strings, if we clip the strings, both the puppets and puppeteers end the show, giving the audience time to take stock.

Don't ignore the problem at hand, in other words, but also don't pretend that fixing that problem fixes the bigger problem.  You don't cure a disease by focusing on symptoms.  You also can't cure a disease by following [miasma theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory), imagining that the illness affects you from outside the body...despite what [RFK, Jr., would have you believe {% cc %}](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/14/nx-s1-5429732/ancient-miasma-theory-may-help-explain-health-secretary-robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-vaccine-moves).

## Recap

If you didn't get the point earlier, let's review the country's historical record in the context of how people talk about alleged foreign interference.

- "Russian-style disinformation," as mentioned, derives directly from the [Big Tobacco playbook](https://theconversation.com/smoking-rates-in-us-have-fallen-to-all-time-low-but-how-did-they-ever-get-so-high-107185).  And note that Big Tobacco literally grew out of an economy built on [forced labor camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_complexes_in_the_Southern_United_States), and pivoted quickly from exploiting the labor of Black people to [destroying their bodies](https://web.archive.org/web/20210412180223/https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/04/12/racist-roots-big-tobacco) with the product.
- The Nazis [modeled the Nuremberg Laws on Jim Crow](https://blackamericaweb.com/2025/04/07/ged-section-lessons-unlearned-how-jim-crow-inspired-nazi-germany/), studying the treatment of ex-slaves as a path to excluding Jewish people from society "politely" enough that the international community would ignore it.
- Speaking of Nazis, we treat concentration camps like "a German thing," despite our [concentration camps for Japanese Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) at around the same time and [mass incarceration creating labor camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States).
- Religious fundamentalism, far from coming to our shores from the Taliban or whatever other Muslim group frightens conservatives this week, [Puritans established much of New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_in_North_America), and you can draw a direct line from them to the so-called [Moral Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority) (neither moral nor a majority).
- We talk about [Russian oligarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs) influencing the [broligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broligarchy), as if we didn't perfect the [Gilded Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age), with exactly that same combination of conspicuous consumption among the wealthy, disinterest in the fate of the poor, political corruption, and so forth.
- [Political correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) and [cancel culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture) try to frame a government enforcing a viewpoint---usually fictionally, in modern discourse, because the terms mysteriously vanish, when conservatives actually ban books and fire people for [improper ideology {% cc %}](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-improper-ideology-order-smithsonian)---as coming from someplace like Russia or China, as if we didn't have *two* [Red Scares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Red_Scare) in the twentieth century with the deliberate aim of systematically purging any forces that might impede capitalistic exploitation.
- Even so-called [Hungarian-style autocracy {% cc %}](https://apnews.com/article/trump-orban-hungary-autocracy-authoritarian-republicans-dfdf6299a614ec4e364be37c1132e446) sounds exactly like the [Second Red Scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare#Second_Red_Scare_%281947%E2%80%931957%29) and the behavior of the United States during the Cold War in general, not only trying to excise any thinking opposed to the military-industrial complex, but propping up tin-pot dictators in [banana republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic)[^wXo_rM] as alleged obstacles to the [spread of Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory).

[^wXo_rM]:  We also propped up the dictatorship in Spain, presumably for similar reasons.  On Francisco Franco's death, [Nixon eulogized him](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/21/archives/nixon-asserts-franco-won-respect-for-spain.html) as having "unified a divided nation through a policy of firmness and fairness toward those who had fought against him," such as (I suppose) during the [White Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_%28Spain%29).  Some [Republicans still love him](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/republican-politician-defends-quoting-general-28292037).

You can't fault us for modesty, I guess, crediting everybody for what we see, but you get what I mean.  We consistently point across the borders to use as a point of comparison for extremist behavior in the United States.  But in many cases, our parents and grandparents probably had more direct experience with the idea than their counterparts overseas did.

## Warning Bells

And with that all said, if we whitewash global and American history, then we leave ourselves vulnerable to the next propaganda campaign, because believing that we don't have those kinds of problems here---as the [1776 Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1776_Commission)[^Dx_sUL] would've insisted, you might recall, and successor initiatives still insist---means that our resistance to our worst impulses atrophies.  After all, why do you think that *they* want to whitewash history?  Why do you think that so much conservative thought has turned to never making straight white men think about inequality, or why they associate patriotism with ignoring the uncomfortable parts of history?

[^Dx_sUL]:  I read the 1776 Commission report when it came out with the intent of disassembling it on the blog, but it didn't have anything bad in an *interesting* way, so I abandoned the idea...

Don't think of this risk as hypothetical or futuristic, by the way.  Think about how often criticisms of the Trump minions drift into offensive stereotypes or vague insinuations[^7lwZDd] instead of professional incompetence, for example.  The fact that the latter applies doesn't make the former acceptable.  But if we haven't learned how our predecessors might have associated the two, then we can only avoid it accidentally.

[^7lwZDd]:  For a painfully common example across independent media, think about how often you'll hear someone working themselves up into a lather over some conservative's sexual indiscretion or sexuality, whether soliciting sex workers or having non-heterosexual affairs, then rush to cover their lapse by explaining that they don't *actually* care about the sex part---even though they attacked it specifically, multiple times, and mentioned nothing else---but their *hypocrisy*...which they didn't mention at all until they realized that they have a reputation to protect, and which we've found doesn't work against a social class that doesn't care about shame.  And compare that process to the process of stochastic terrorism, where a powerful figure incites hate against a disadvantaged group and then insist that they don't support violence when violence directly results from those words.

This has loomed for a while, since long before I started bringing it up.  Consider all the times that you've heard Trump himself referred to as the puppet of some foreign power.  While that may ultimately prove true, it seems reckless to assume that when the more likely possibility exists that he "only" hates the country's people, laws, traditions, and ideals.  We all know that "real estate fan fiction"---loving the country but hating everything about it except for the actual land---has become a staple of conservative patriotism.

Remember:  We don't need to import fancy foreign hate.  We already have plenty of home-grown hate to go around, too much even, so don't ignore it.  Maybe we can even consider cleaning some of it up, remediating the country like a cultural Superfund site.
