This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Spacers Please**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Spacers Please**
 * Location:  <https://hawkbat.itch.io/spacers-please>, ~~<https://github.com/Hawkbat/SpacersPlease>~~
 * Released:  2023
 * License:  MIT
 * Creator:  Joshua "[Hawkbat](https://itch.io/profile/hawkbat)" Thome
 * Medium:  Video game
 * Length:  Approximately ten minutes (probably)
 * Content Advisories:  Authoritarianism, complicity, reports of violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Spacers Please

The creator describes the game as follows.

> Spacers Please is a real-time puzzle game where you monitor and analyze space traffic in the hopes of identifying the system housing the nefarious rebellion. It was created for the [2023 Bigmode Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-2023).
>
> The theme of the jam was "mode." We used the word's definition in statistics of "the most common value in a set of data." In Spacers Please, you have to pick out 'ion readings' as well as the location of the rebel base from a collection of random data over the course of the game. These values come up more often than the others, but you can never be totally sure until you've seen the entire data set.

We have instructions and credits, too.

And you now know what I know, here.

## What Works Well?

I like the premise.  Presumably[^LhVCJ-], the story either will eventually have or already does have beyond the point that I could reach ethical questions to resolve over the course of the campaign.

[^LhVCJ-]:  The title presumably references the non-Free Culture **Papers, Please**, which combined with the similar pass/fail mechanics, suggests plot intentions.

Despite some minor implementation issues, the game also feels fairly well-made.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

People who enjoy action games can feel free to disagree, but it feels like the game moves far too fast.  It seems like, if you give every ship sufficient time in any random order, then you can't complete a "level."  And because time becomes tighter and selection becomes somewhat more difficult later in a ship's path, it almost seems like you need to know in advance which order to check the ships.

Also, I may have had trouble understanding the game, or it may have implementation problems.  As a quick test after failing trial after trial, I tried reporting *every* ship, without bothering to consult the analyses.  And somehow, that led to rebel ships slipping through the dragnet.  I couldn't get more than barely adequate results, even in the (single) case where it appeared that I got everything right.  And without access to the code (see below), I couldn't tell you if this happens because I got something wrong or the game artificially ends.

And I have to admit that it bothers me a bit that many planets take their names from popular culture not under Free Culture licenses.

## Opportunities

Weirdly, I don't see any.  Even the GitHub repository linked from the game's page seems missing.  Although I suppose that you could check out the creator's other work.

## What's Adaptable?

The game provides an unnamed interplanetary empire with a rebellious faction, five classes of ship, and a series of methods for identifying legitimate traffic.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, about a month late to celebrate [KDE](https://kde.org/)'s twenty-ninth anniversary, we'll read up on the official background of Konqi the dragon, the project's mascot.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic?
