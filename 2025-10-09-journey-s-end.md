## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Journey's End

Since the last post, **Deep Space Nine** brought in the Klingon captains from the original series to riff on **The Magnificent Seven**, in *Blood Oath*.

This episode, meanwhile...doesn't do that.

I'll skip through a lot of the boring lines up front, but I do want to point out that, when Picard's log refers to picking up "a member of the family," part of me wanted to do a "bit" getting excited about the rarer guest stars who should've gotten more screen time, before they revealed the actual guest...

 > **WESLEY**: Mom, you know that's not why I asked for my own quarters this time.

How would she know that?  He spent almost every scene with her since their introduction telling anybody who'd listen how embarrassing he finds her...

 > **LAFORGE**: So, how's life at the Academy?
 >
 > **WESLEY**: It's great. It's great, but it's good to have a break.

Wait, did he not graduate?  I almost feel like [*Lower Decks*]({% post_url 2025-09-04-lower-decks %}) existed *primarily* to tell us that Wesley and the other cadets had graduated.  Did Wesley fail some classes?  Because that sounds like him.

To my recollection, here, Wesley headed off to the Academy near the start of the fourth season, shortly after [*Final Mission*]({% post_url 2024-01-04-final-mission %}), with credits under his belt for his practical experience as an "acting ensign" serving under Picard.  That would have put him up for graduation in [*The First Duty*]({% post_url 2024-09-19-first-duty %}), as hinted by his counterpart serving aboard the *Enterprise* in [*Parallels*]({% post_url 2025-08-07-parallels %}), **except** that his participation in a conspiracy to cover up the manslaughter of a classmate set him back a year.  And that year expired before in the setup to *Lower Decks*, right...?

 > **DATA**: I was of course not serious about calling Security. It was a joke.

Right.  They would never call security to deal with a white man in a uniform...

 > **PICARD**: I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral. There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past.

Honestly, I don't see the conflict.  We met her in [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}), where she sent him on the mission that he fouled up.  And then she authorized Jellico acting against the concealed Cardassians, at the possible expense of not retrieving Picard, the same kind of call the Picard routinely makes.  And then she poked her head in during [*Descent*]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}), she complained that Picard didn't commit genocide against the Borg, something that *he* regretted not doing in that same episode.  They sound like they should get along pretty well together.

 > **NECHAYEV**: Thank you. You may leave, Commander Riker.

Could we have done that for seven years...?

 > **NECHAYEV**: You'll notice a demilitarized zone has also been created along the border. Neither side will be permitted to place military outposts, conduct fleet exercises, or station warships anywhere in the demilitarized area.
 >
 > **PICARD**: This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassian territory and some Cardassian colonies in ours.

We don't *really* care about this, except that, when we move into **Deep Space Nine**, and then again when we move over to **Voyager**, this treaty will become central for at least a while.

 > **NECHAYEV**: This agreement is far from perfect. Neither side got everything they wanted, but every side got something. And as someone once said, diplomacy is the art of the possible. Those colonies finding themselves on the wrong side of the border will have to be moved.

Oh, and the Federation has no qualms about selling out its citizens.  You live in Ruritania, now.  Tough luck.  We'll help you apply for a work visa, if you want to immigrate...

 > **PICARD**: Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North American Indians settled?

No, because we stopped calling them that in the 1980s.  Indians come from India, so North American Indians would include people of Indian ancestry who reside in---but have not immigrated to, because we use a different convention for that---a North American country.  Native/Indigenous Americans have their ancestral roots in North America.  It seems especially galling when they connect this group *directly* with the [Pueblo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_peoples)[^wVRWKl], so they could've picked a relevant tribe (always the better way of doing this than dismissing them as indistinguishable) and run with it without changing any other part of the script, for all the insight that we get into their culture.  But what else should I expect from him?  In [*Where Silence Has Lease*]({% post_url 2022-12-01-silence-lease %}), he reminisced fondly with Riker about the Academy course where they teach about everybody believing in a Flat Earth with the Sun orbiting it, a historical period that never existed.

[^wVRWKl]:  I find the term uncomfortable, myself, since the term comes from the Spanish colonizers, naming the people after their propensity to living in villages, but I can't find a less-offensive term other than listing the Taos, Zuni, Acoma, Hopi, and other groups.

Speaking of which, if you dig that sort of thing, this coming Sunday's post might interest you.

Oh, and they'll keep using the word, in a seemingly worse tone as the episode progresses.  I don't know if they did it on purpose or if they wear me down, but I do want to note how this fits right into the New Age motifs in this show, because especially at the time, they loved nothing more than misappropriating Native American culture.  [Germans, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_German_popular_culture), for a shockingly long time, sympathizing with the removal from native lands feeding right into nationalist movements by appealing to precursors of "blood and soil" eugenics.

 > **PICARD**: You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historical parallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homes because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant government.

I mean...last time involved a campaign of [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal) because the fairly nearby government wanted their land for white people.  And many Americans opposed those actions.  This feels like terrible policy, sure, but notifying this village that their land no longer sits in Federation territory and suggesting that they relocate doesn't *really* seem like the same sort of thing...unless he denies the impact of the Trail of Tears or something.

 > **NECHAYEV**: Then your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are necessary. I understand your moral objections, Captain. If you wish, I can find someone else to command the *Enterprise* for this mission.

That seems weird.  She ordered him to *ask* them to move, earlier in this scene.  Does the Federation usually follow up their polite requests with threats of violence?

 > **PICARD**: That will not be necessary, Admiral.

Picard, you will note, has finished protesting.  He considers this an immoral order, but I guess that he doesn't want to give her the satisfaction of...not participating in what he compared to ethnic cleansing moments ago.

 > **NECHAYEV**: And Captain, thank you for making me feel welcome.
 >
 > **PICARD**: You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral.

Did they *date* at some point?  It feels like we missed some serious back-story, here.

 > **LAFORGE**: Thanks, Ensign. Hey, Wes! There you are. Come here for a second. I've got something I want to show you. Come on, come on. You've got to take a look at this. Now, remember how we always used to talk about improving quantum efficiency by creating a new plasma-dyne relay? Well, take a look at this.

Sorry, you'll need to speak up.  I can't hear you over that vest.

 > **LAFORGE**: With this kind of an attitude, absolutely not. You're dismissed.

I almost commented on Wesley getting a pass for his smug, holier-than-thou garbage, which has served as a central part of his character since the beginning, but La Forge worked it out for us, this time.

 > **PICARD**: Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about this planet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet.

I mean...he could *defy* the order.

 > **WESLEY**: Maybe I am sick of following rules and regulations. Maybe I am sick of living up to everyone else's expectations. Did you ever think of that?

Poor baby, needs to actually follow rules at a job.  Such things must feel so far beneath our favorite indigo child...

 > **PICARD**: Well, a great deal, actually. My father was a strong believer in passing on the traditions and history of the family.

As I've mentioned before, over the years, this sort of obsession with family history and lore almost always comes from wealthy families.  They have a strong continuity, plus pride.  And also as I've pointed out many times before, Picard grew up in his family's ancestral castle, so that tracks, even as he poses as a humble nobody.

 > **LAKANTA**: I have known that you were coming to us for the past two years. Two years ago, I went into the Habak and began a vision quest. While I was there I saw many things, talked to many animals, many spirits. And I saw you.

Way to slather on the stereotypes, writers.  Not even discount-Scotland in [*Sub Rosa*]({% post_url 2025-08-28-sub-rosa %}) went on like this about kilts and caber tosses or whatever.

 > **PICARD**: Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then any efforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to work this out for himself.

Plus, this---the rejection of rules, the demand for dominance, the dismissal of women, the refusing to talk about his emotions---seems like run-of-the-mill toxic masculinity, to me, their usual deal, so I don't really know why they even notice it, let alone find it a problem.  If he wore a blazer instead of that hideous vest, would that have helped?

 > **LAKANTA**: Look around us. What do you think is sacred to us here?
 >
 > **WESLEY**: Maybe the necklace you're wearing? The designs on the walls?

What a complete and utter jackass.  "Well, you seem primitive, so maybe you worship some trinkets?"

 > **WESLEY**: I think that's the first time anyone's used that particular word to describe me.

A healthier person might question why people don't use kind words when describing him...though I suppose a healthier person might also not have this problem.

 > **ANTHWARA**: When you first came to us, we did not know why you were sent by the Federation, but we knew there must be a good reason. To us, nothing that happens is truly random. So we searched for the true reason you were sent. We did not find it until last night. Are you familiar with the Pueblo Revolt of sixteen eighty?
 >
 > **TROI**: I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanish overlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico.
 >
 > **ANTHWARA**: Ten years later, the Spanish returned to reconquer the area. They were brutal. I would use the word savage. They killed hundreds of our people. Thousands more were maimed. The name of one of the soldiers was Javier Maribona-Picard. Your ancestor.

Shockingly, [Po'pay's Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Revolt) actually happened, almost as described.  Notably, it took the Spanish a full twelve years to reconquer the area, only returning at all, because they felt that they needed that beachhead against the French west of the Mississippi River.

 > **PICARD**: I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, and this happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it can have.

Picard traces his family---earlier in this episode---to the reign of [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne)[^DGOvYN], but can't seem to remember the soldier working for the Spanish crown far more recently.

[^DGOvYN]:  Not the radio host, Pippin's father...the protagonist of the musical, not the basketball player or the Hobbit.  And given the [actual spelling of his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepin_the_Hunchback), also not the [celebrity chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_P%C3%A9pin).

And that recency claim seems important, because he did make a big deal about his family cohesion over more than *sixteen* hundred years, two (and a quarter) times longer than the incident he insists happened so long ago as to not have any relevance to his life.

 > **WORF**: We have unwelcome visitors, sir.

And they have struck a classy pose for---I can only assume---an album cover, the bastards.

 > **PICARD**: Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this is Federation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these people are under my jurisdiction and I will protect them.
 >
 > **EVEK**: Is that a threat?

It seems like a fairly clear threat, in fact, especially when compared against all the other times that Picard has threatened some non-human because he needed to feel more powerful.

 > **LAKANTA**: The spirits of the Klingon, the Vulcan, the Ferengi come to us just as the bear and the coyote and the parrot. There's no difference.

This would sound significantly less racist if he had included other humans in the list somewhere...

 > **NECHAYEV**: Captain, I made that request two days ago. The answer was no. I'm sorry but you have your orders. Starfleet out.

I want to point out that, for all the crap they give her, she has not only (apparently) done her best to help, but did so *before* they asked, every time that they've asked.  But they still want us to see Picard as righteous and the admiral as some mustache-twirling villain.  Again, this episode really only makes sense to me if they dated, and she left him.

 > **PICARD**: Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of one of my ancestors against his people.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Do you believe that?
 >
 > **PICARD**: No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see how it can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't help wondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to be repeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannot foresee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for a moment?

Gosh, where have I heard "we have no responsibility to fix what our ancestors might have done" before?  In what context do people say that things got pretty bad, but that problem worked itself out, but we might soon need to use violence?  Ah, right, Mitch McConnell literally said that the country shouldn't pay reparations for slavery because [nobody alive participated in the process](https://www.axios.com/2019/06/18/mitch-mcconnell-reparations-slavery-obama)...and by the way, we elected Obama, so problem solved.  And now we have masked agents rounding up anybody who "looks like" an undocumented immigrant, because of Obama, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove the inhabitants from Dorvan Five.

Nobody objects to this order, you notice.  They all "regret" receiving the orders, but they have no problem with carrying them out once given.

 > **WESLEY**: Worf, what are you doing?
 >
 > **WORF**: We are laying out transporter coordinates for a security perimeter. It may be necessary to remove these people by force.

Why tell *him*?  Do they not routinely keep orders like this confidential?

 > **WESLEY**: What you're doing down there is wrong. These people are not some random group of colonists. They're a unique culture with a history that predates the Federation and Starfleet.

I hate that I have to admit that Wesley got something right.  Although I can't say that I see how their long-lived culture gives them some specific natural right to live on a planet that they settled only twenty years ago, and have only erected a single village in that time.

Talk about how they forged a relationship with that ecosystem in the time that they've lived there---which they have, but Wesley does not---and I buy the argument that "some random group of colonists" doesn't apply.  But otherwise...

 > **PICARD**: That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know what has got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I will tell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every order you're given, and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules of conduct. Is that clear?

This seems to confirm what we have suspected, that Starfleet doesn't permit, let alone require, officers to [defy illegal or immoral orders](https://www.army.mil/article/47175/breaking_ranks_dissent_and_the_military_professional)[^6KTkvY].  And surveys suggest that the vast majority of [officers understand their duty](https://theconversation.com/4-out-of-5-us-troops-surveyed-understand-the-duty-to-disobey-illegal-orders-261929), so we might assume that, if nobody has raised the issue, then that idea doesn't exist in Starfleet.

[^6KTkvY]:  By the way, that article notes that *enlisted* members of the service take an oath to obey orders from superiors, but officers only pledge to support and defend the Constitution.

 > **CRUSHER**: Maybe it is partly my fault. We didn't realize the kind of pressure we were putting on you to be exactly what we expected you to be

I've needed to talk about the pressure that they put on kids since [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %}) when one of Wesley's friends tried to defect from the Federation because he didn't get into his first choice of college.  Wesley himself talked about it extensively in [*The Bonding*]({% post_url 2023-06-01-bonding %}) and again in *Final Mission*.  I don't know how Crusher could have *not* noticed...

 > **CRUSHER**: He told Captain Picard a long time ago that you were very special, like Mozart, and that you were destined for something quite different from the rest of us. Maybe this is the first step. I love you.

This irritated us in [*Where No One Has Come Before*]({% post_url 2022-06-23-gone %}).

 > **TRAVELER**: They must find their own destinies, Wesley. It's not our place to interfere.

For the record, I'd like to point out that Wesley counted as "they" moments ago, and now he mostly shrugs his shoulders to go become a bargain-basement Q.  He *would* have taken a stand in support of an oppressed people, but this project seemed super-important, too, you know...?

 > **PICARD**: Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions of lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that same path again. Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us one last chance for peace.

Interesting.  In [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-30-chain-command-2 %}), Picard noted that the Cardassians lost "hundreds of thousands of lives."  Have they discovered an order of magnitude more casualties, or did the Federation lose many more people than the Cardassians?

 > **PICARD**: Anthwara, I want to make absolutely sure that you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving up your status as Federation citizens, any future request you or your people make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your own and under Cardassian jurisdiction.

I joked about their needing visas, but apparently, yes, they do lose their citizenship because they live beyond Federation boundaries.

 > **ANTHWARA**: I was right, Captain. You did not take us from our land, and you have wiped clean a very old stain of blood.

Wait, he gets *credit* for this mess?  He planned to carry out orders, and let things escalate to the verge of a massacre before his opponent stood down in the name of peace and seemingly offered the option of Cardassian citizenship.  Picard did nothing useful, here---in fact, he prepared exactly the military response that the Cardassians had, for when he forcibly removed them---and certainly didn't atone for anything.

Anyway, this *should* end Wesley's story, like the title says.  But as many of you might already know, he rears his head in one of the films, and the modern franchise has insisted on bringing him back as a deus ex machina, in both **Picard** and **Prodigy**, inexplicably connecting him to Gary Seven from [*Assignment:  Earth*]({% post_url 2021-02-04-earth %}), where his place has apparently become "to interfere," full-time, while making popular culture references.

## Conclusions

We get some history, and some opportunities for me to rant, but not much of substance, really.

### The Good

The crew has *finally* realized the Wesley's pretense and toxic masculinity don't actually help.  And they have also started to acknowledge the stress that they create for children by pushing them to constantly excel.

### The Bad

We see what seems like a thoroughly irrational hatred of Nechayev, where they talk about her behind her back and complain about her inaction to her face, even while she takes some of the most progressive actions in the episode.  They refer to past run-ins, but in those, she mostly agreed with them.

The Federation readily trades inhabited territory in treaty negotiations, without consulting with the current residents.  They can object and have their objections dismissed after the fact.  And, apparently, when the Federation requests that citizens do something, if refused, Starfleet forces them to do it anyway.  They also lose Federation citizenship for now living on the wrong side of the border.

The Federation also appears to deliberately use colonial names for the descendants of oppressed populations, and assume that older cultures think in transactionally animist ways.  Historians also teach the ethnic cleansing of indigenous populations as out-of-touch governments asking that they relocate.  Humans also seem to class non-human animals, including humanoid creatures, as distinct from humanity.  And likewise, we continue to see the near-obsession with having power over non-humans, in threatening the Cardassians to whom the Federation gave a legal right to look the planet over.

Throughout the episode, despite many complaints about orders, we never see a single Starfleet officer refuse or defy an order on any grounds.  Picard also directly informs Wesley that officers must obey every order given to them by a superior officer.

We get a reminder that Starfleet serves as an outlet for the wealthy, in Picard's ability to trace his lineage back over sixteen centuries.  But he conveniently doesn't recall the Conquistador who participated in attempted genocide, and can't imagine that he has any responsibility to atone for terrible actions that his family made and profited from.

### The Weird

Starfleet apparently doesn't have secrecy rules for their secret missions, and officers can tell anybody they please about their plan.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next time, when the show decides that it needs to make a man out of Alexander, in *Firstborn*.
