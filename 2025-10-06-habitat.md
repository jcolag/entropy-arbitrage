Today, we celebrate [World Habitat Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Habitat_Day), reflecting on the essential right to adequate shelter.  Themes have ranged from sheltering the unhoused, to safer cities, to the gender gap in local governance, and so forth, with occasional nods at trying to head off urban sprawl.

In addition, we celebrate and affirm the lives of people living with cerebral palsy for---to nobody's surprise, I imagine---[Cerebral Palsy Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cerebral_Palsy_Day).  And we also celebrate student-run broadcast media of greater variety than the name [College Radio Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Radio_Day) implies.

With that, on to the week's projects.

## Mini-Server, Part 13

On a whim, because I don't know if I'll actually use it, I decided to install [Calmness](https://calmness.mvze.net/), to guide through breathing exercises.

To get it to work, I needed to edit `astro.config.mjs` to add a `base` URL path to work in my server, and update the `site` to match my server.  I also needed to go in manually and add that path to the URLs for files like the chime sound and logo.

With that success, I also took another pass at getting [Cloverleaf](https://github.com/cloverleaf/web) running.  I got fairly close, with some tweaking.  I needed to disable the interaction with the translation platform, and similar adjusting of paths.  However, generating the password tries to call a `ki.process()` method that doesn't seem to exist, probably because I overlooked a path to some JavaScript file[^e7OCeq].

[^e7OCeq]:  In some ways, I wonder if I should give up on using Cloverleaf specifically, and implement something equivalent.  Really, this only needs a user interface to take a pass-phrase, an application name or domain, and password length, maybe some toggles to turn things like punctuation on and off for sites that don't want certain characters in their passwords, plus some JavaScript to hash them together and create a string that a person can type.  It wouldn't store any information, so that *can* work in a single HTML file.

And in even less impressive showings, I tried to build [Graphite](https://graphite.rs/) for my Raspberry Pi, and get [QR Frame](https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng/) running.  Neither got far, though I'll get back to the latter later in this post.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

Given the various recent changes around here, I made slight changes to the [about page](/blog/about)---mentioning the [store](/store) in particular---and [code of conduct](/blog/coc).  The link to the Codeberg source at the bottom of every post also now should work correctly with the proper explanations.  And for the embedded video in the [*Wikiversity Science Fiction Challenge*]({% post_url 2025-09-27-wsfc-mnemtronium %}) posts, the blog now has a general style for the HTML `video` element.

## Smoke Alarm

{% codeberg jcolag/smoke-alarm %}

While I never finished this, largely because [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS) rules made it messier than I wanted to deal with during development, I have copied the serverless application over to Codeberg.

## Common Calendar

{% codeberg jcolag/common-calendar %}

Likewise, though it probably needs maintenance and I never did much with it other than noting the date in every issue of the [newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag)[^4XsbYN], my semi-fictional calendar application now resides on Codeberg, too.

[^4XsbYN]:  The current issue of which, incidentally, went out via Mailchimp on Saturday and you still have time to catch on Buy Me a Coffee before it goes out tomorrow morning, as I publish this post.

I still like the idea, eleven months of thirty-three days---for a total of three hundred sixty-three days plus two holidays---with days of the week named for famous Free Culture projects and months named for fictional deities in the public domain.  And the calendar starts with the earliest known written date that we can map to our calendar.

## AttaCard Generator

{% codeberg jcolag/attacard-generator %}

At some point, after discovering the [Squib](https://github.com/andymeneely/squib) library/language, I had the vague idea of putting together a digital [collectible card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game) that also wanted to feel like a deck of playing or tarot cards.  It never went anywhere[^5cwh1S], and I don't know if Squib even still works, but I do like the idea and might want to revisit it at some point.

[^5cwh1S]:  Based on the commit dates, I would have started a job when I stopped working on it, suggesting that I didn't have the energy for both.

In any case, if I get back to the idea, the project now lives on Codeberg.

## Wierd

{% codeberg jcolag/Wierd %}

Again, moving things to Codeberg, this repository one of the odd minimalist programming languages that people once knew me for.  This language follows paths around a two-dimensional space, executing one of six actions---not exactly *instructions*, since they don't explicitly appear---or eight, depending on how you count them, based on the angle that the line makes.

I believe that some people out there still hold a grudge against me, because I *dared* make the x-coordinate rows of the source file and the y-coordinate the columns, as if those have real-world meanings beyond arbitrary choices made in math classes...

## Ask INTERN

{% codeberg jcolag/ask-intern %}

I moved [INTERN](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/intern) over to Codeberg, last week, so it only seemed right for the client application to follow it.  I forget why I wrote it in Haskell, given how little it needs to do...

## Rube II

{% codeberg jcolag/klickenklacker %}

Add another to the small, weird programming language pile moving to Codeberg.  As I recall, I developed this partly because the creator of [RUBE](https://esolangs.org/wiki/RUBE)[^pDTnMc] said something about wishing that the language looked more like an actual cellular automaton, but also partly because that idea seemed worth presenting to my programming languages classes.

[^pDTnMc]:  Rube, as in [Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg), the cartoonist, not [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or any [yokel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rube), the last allegedly deriving from the disproportionate number of men named Reuben in small towns.

The name came from some early chain e-mail, I believe, some spoof German warning message about blinking lights and things slamming together, probably my biggest regret about the project...

## Prim

{% codeberg jcolag/Prim %}

And one last little programming language moving to Codeberg for the week, Prim *only* provided access to some minimal set of [primitive recursive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function), though I apparently never got to the *recursive* part.  And the compiler also inexplicably generates code for a closed-source C-like structured assembly language.

## Shiori

{% github go-shiori/shiori %}

While I didn't have any code to contribute, in the spirit of full disclosure, I *did* start asking [questions about the Shiori API](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/discussions/1154#discussioncomment-14577709).

Shiori, as you might recall from last week, acts as a bookmark manager.  I installed it shortly before last week's post, with the intent of switching over to a less-fussy system when I generate my list of random links---for the aforementioned newsletter---than Firefox's databases.  I managed to get everything running, *but* couldn't work out how to get the API to respond.  The creator walked me through that.

## QR Frame

{% github zhengkyl/qrframe %}

After messing around with QR Frame briefly for [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2025-10-05-free-culture-philosophy %}), I decided that I probably want the application running on my local network.  However, building and deploying didn't work out well, so I posted [an issue asking for help](https://github.com/zhengkyl/qrframe/issues/4).

With any luck, the project creator still loiters on GitHub often enough that I can get some documentation, or at least a pointer to whatever tool actually handles the build.

## Next

Once again, expect more of the same, as I move old projects over to Codeberg.  Excluding projects that don't actually have anything interesting in them---for example, the many projects where I created a repository and an empty web framework, then never added any custom code---I might have come close to the end of the process, though, so {% emoji crossed fingers %} you might get more normal content in these posts again someday soon...

Oh, and I may also start looking for installation advice on some of the other projects that I have tried but failed to install.
