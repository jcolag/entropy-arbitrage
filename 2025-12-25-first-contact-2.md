Before we get started, a Merry Christmas (or general too-little-light-to-do-anything-but-party season in the Northern Hemisphere) to those who celebrate, whether you have a nice celebration with family or came here to get as far away from that as possible.  Everybody else have a great day (or evening), too, but you can assume that I generally hope that people have a good time...

## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## First Contact

Picking up where we left off [last week]({% post_url 2025-12-18-first-contact-1 %}), Picard murdered a colleague "because Borg," after floating the idea of dissolving all organic matter in the engineering department, and we cut to the pastoral Montana scene...

 > **LAFORGE**: Oh, yeah. Basic Warp Design is a required course at the Academy. The first chapter is called...Zefram Cochrane.

Two parts of this anecdote make me seriously worry about the quality of Federation educational institutions.

One, I have never seen a class, college or otherwise, with "chapters."  Lessons, lectures, weeks, and other nouns, yes, but chapters generally go in books...or in large organizations.

Two, assuming that La Forge misspoke and meant that the *textbook* has that first chapter, what the Hell kind of engineering textbook[^DIHgir] names its chapters after people?  Imagine **Basic Aerospace Engineering**, Chapter One, *Wilbur Wright*, or **Introduction to Physics**, Chapter One, *Archimedes*.  Both of those would sound highly suspect, unless you have a specific book/course on the history of the technology...but then you wouldn't name it in such a way that people would confuse it with the actual introductory book/class.

[^DIHgir]:  For context on what got so much of my attention, here, I graduated from an engineering college, not to far back from when this film hit theaters.  And I can pretty much guarantee that no professor would tolerate this nonsense, and students would have rioted.  I even had trouble getting students to take the early runs of my programming languages class seriously, because the textbook (assigned by the department, not chosen by me) kicked off every chapter with a terrifying glamour shot of some famous-in-these-circles developer.

That said, this seems like the first time that anybody has praised their education instead of dismissing it as unrealistic or wasteful.

 > **BARCLAY**: Commander, this is what we're thinking of using to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit.

Like Ogawa last time, we last saw Barclay in [*Genesis*]({% post_url 2025-10-02-genesis %}).

 > **LAFORGE**: It's just a little hero worship, Doctor. To tell you the truth I can't say I blame them. We all grew up hearing about what you did. Or what you're about to do. You know I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I went to Zefram Cochrane High School.

It seems like more than "a little hero worship," honestly, because they keep crowding and distracting him, as if he owes everybody his time.  Also, La Forge "shouldn't" tell him about the high school, but will go on to ramble about the future for a while.

Similarly, either La Forge wants to continue the creepy parasocial relationship by trying to imply a personal connection or he *massively* understates things.  In [*Metamorphosis*]({% post_url 2020-10-08-meta %}), Spock refers to planets, universities, and cities taking Cochrane's name, and I listed some (real) historical figures who might fit an equivalent profile for us.  His specific choice also strikes me as interesting, because K-12 school names often seem "contagious," with many names replicated across a country.  You can confirm and explore with the [National Center for Education Statistics search](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/), but [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy) has over a hundred schools named for him, and [Cesar Chavez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez) over seventy, with a bunch of names in that general class.

In other words, assuming that Spock didn't get this wrong for whatever reason, and Cochrane has multiple planets named for him, then one imagines that almost everybody in the Federation knows *somebody* who graduated from one Zefram Cochrane High School or another, much like almost everyone in the United States knows many people who graduated from JFK High but have never lived anywhere near each other.

 > **COCHRANE**: Don't you people from the twenty-fourth century ever pee?

I mentioned with [**Generations**]({% post_url 2025-12-11-star-trek-generations-2 %}) that Paramount, around this time, started to become increasingly interested in trying to "get in on the joke," which largely meant having characters repeat jokes that they found on the Internet.  In this case, as I may have mentioned before, early "blueprints" released for the *Enterprise* only thought to show the kinds of facilities actually seen on screen, leading to questions about when and where they relieve themselves.  That ultimately metastasized into an entire series, so I can only hope that they've gotten it out of their system for a while, emptying their appropriation bladders, if you will...

 > **PICARD**: Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated. I found something you lost.

I mean...not *greatly* exaggerated, considering that [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-10-26-both-worlds-1 %}) focused almost entirely on that event.  And no amount of [paraphrasing Mark Twain](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/06/07/report-death/) fixes that oversight.

 > **WORF**: I am a Klingon.

You'll notice that Worf already knows that he needs to explain himself without hesitation, presumably related to how he has mentioned not fitting in, growing up.  I mean, he barely even waits until she looks at him.

 > **CRUSHER**: But in the twenty-first century the Borg are still in the Delta Quadrant.

The Borg got an absurd amount of back-story in **Voyager**, by the way, somehow none of actual interest, as I recall...

 > **PICARD**: They'll send reinforcements. Humanity will be an easy target. Attack the Earth in the past to assimilate the future.

That would make an excellent political slogan...

 > **PICARD**: We can't get to deflector control or the shuttle-craft. Mister Worf, do you remember your zero-G combat training?
 >
 > **WORF**: I remember it made me sick in my stomach. What are you suggesting?

Much as I, as always, appreciate Michael Dorn's comedy, it also seems worth considering why Picard singled him out, assuming that he didn't want to tee up Dorn.  Surely, he already knows that Worf gets space-sick, and...I don't know, maybe give some of the no-names something to do other than ask for exposition.  We have already repeatedly seen that Riker loves to undermine Worf, and now it looks like Picard has joined that mob.

 > **BORG QUEEN**: Do you always talk this much?

If only you had him under your control, so that you could shut him up and save us all the grief...

 > **BORG QUEEN**: You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.

I continue to maintain that Data unambiguously lied in at least [*The Most Toys*]({% post_url 2023-09-28-most-toys %}), even if we assume nowhere else.

 > **DATA**: If...you are...referring to...sexuality, I am fully functional. Programmed in...multiple techniques.
 >
 > **BORG QUEEN**: How long has it been since you've used them?
 >
 > **DATA**: Eight years, seven months, sixteen days, one minutes, twenty-two...

Yes, yes, we all watched [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}).  As far as I know, everybody continues to dislike it.

Also, when he counts seconds, does he mean from the start or the end of the report?  It takes him nearly a second to deliver the line, after all, pretty much the entire reason that we don't describe time in such granularity.

 > **WORF**: We should bring reinforcements.

Wait, they didn't plan for *exactly* this?  They had to know what they would walk into.

 > **PICARD**: No! There's a risk that we hit the dish. It's charged with anti-protons. We could destroy half the ship. We have to find another way.

He planned to sacrifice every engineer on the chance that they got Borg cooties, last time, so why not destroy another ship this time through?  Surely, more than letting Sloane die as Picard suggested to Crusher last time, the Prime Directive calls on him to sacrifice himself, no?  Or does sacrifice only apply to the peons?

 > **RIKER**: We don't have time for this. You told him about the statue?

Yes, Riker decided that it made perfect sense to shoot at and effectively abduct a major historical figure---potentially breaking his neck or drowning him, I might add---instead of talking him down.

 > **PICARD**: Hawk!

It seems worth mentioning that they filmed this scene to give Picard all the credit, even though the Borg mostly left him alone while he left them to asphyxiate Worf and assimilate Hawk.  Worf even manages to survive to wait for Picard to take the important save-the-day shot, instead of finishing the job himself and smacking the captain around for a while like a normal person.

 > **RIKER**: Someone once said, *Don't try to be a great man. Just be a man, and let history make its own judgments*.
 >
 > **COCHRANE**: Rhetorical nonsense. Who said that?
 >
 > **RIKER**: You did, ten years from now. You've got fifty-eight minutes, Doc. You better get on that checklist.

I don't know why I love the quote because it actually has legs, or because---despite quoting it---Riker and the rest of the crew seem to have no interest in the advice.  We wouldn't even have the film, if the crew didn't chafe at having the galaxy's attention focused anywhere but on them.

 > **DANIELS**: They're on the move again. The Borg just overrun three of our defense checkpoints. They've taken over decks five and six. They've adapted to every modulation on our weapons. It's like we're shooting blanks.

If Daniels looks familiar, then you might recognize him as [Michael Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Horton_%28actor%29), best known for playing (likely serial killer, the way his girlfriends vanish before the end of almost every episode) Grady Fletcher from **Murder, She Wrote**[^Aqo571].  He *may* have also worked as a puppeteer on [**Mister Rogers' Neighborhood**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood), playing the later batch of puppets that look like stitched together nylon stockings; the name appears in the credits, and both the Wikipedia and IMDb entries for the show link their Horton with this one, I can't find any evidence pointing the other way[^_yySEa], from participant to production, making it seem like people writing about the show assumed that matching names referred to the same person, but nobody interested in the performer thought that it made sense.

[^Aqo571]:  This would make our second major connection to **Murder, She Wrote**, since we had [William Windom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Windom_%28actor%29) as the guest star as Matt Decker way back in [*The Doomsday Machine*]({% post_url 2020-09-17-doomday %}).  And we have many minor connections, since it feels like every character actor of the era makes an appearance.

[^_yySEa]:  Frankly, it also seems highly unlikely for somebody to have worked extensively with both Angela Lansbury and Fred Rogers, and *not* become a celebrity purely on talk show and convention appearances to talk about some of the kindest people in entertainment, by all accounts.

 > **WORF**: Wait! Captain, our weapons are useless. We must activate the auto-destruct sequence and use the escape pods to evacuate the ship.

Right?  They could've done that *before* the space-walk.

 > **PICARD**: We have not lost the *Enterprise*, Mister Worf. We are not going to lose the *Enterprise*, not to the Borg, not while I'm in command. You have your orders.

Wait a minute.  I had the impression that the self-destruct gizmos existed entirely for this purpose, so that they don't lose the ship to an invasive force.  Otherwise, what other situation would actually convince them to use it?

 > **PICARD**: You're afraid. You want to destroy the ship and run away. You coward.

I have to admit that, sometimes, even *I* think that I might have exaggerated over the years when I indicated Picard's strong authoritarian leanings.  "Surely, if nobody else talks about it," I wonder, "maybe I read too much into it."  But every time that I get to that point, the captain reassures me by sounding like every jackass who refused to accept a few days of COVID-19 lockdowns or wear a mask because only *cowards* follow rational medical procedure instead of fighting virions hand-to-protein-spike.

 > **WORF**: If you were any other man I would kill you where you stand.

I feel like I should point out---because nobody else seems to want to, in this scene---that they have a clear case for removing Picard from authority, even assuming that he has any three hundred years in the past.  His orders, if we take it as given that the Borg present an existential threat---more on that later---threaten the entire galaxy, by giving them access to future technology, a beachhead, and a defenseless population.  In fact, I half-joked about this last time, but given his uncanny guesswork about how to stop the Borg early on, they really should ask if they still control him, at this point, because he seems to *really* want to lose.

Now, I went through that for a reason, beyond venting about this nonsensical plot:  Worf makes it clear that they humor him, because they prioritize personal loyalty over the entire galaxy.  Crusher, likewise, doesn't outright say it as she did in [*All Good Things...*]({% post_url 2025-11-20-all-good-things-2 %}), but still makes it clear that she doesn't dare contradict the bald guy.

 > **SLOANE**: They're probably accustomed to your orders making sense.

Not really, though.  [*Allegiance*]({% post_url 2023-08-31-allegiance %}) largely hinges on the fact that the crew doesn't care if orders make any sense.  And in *All Good Things...*, Picard even has that rousing bowl of word salad about how they should accept his half-assed commands, along with everybody in the future assuring us that they'll even follow him through literal dementia fever-dreams if he asks.

 > **PICARD**: None of them understand the Borg as I do. No one does. No one can.

That'll happen when you liquefy or shoot anybody who has ended up in a similar situation.

 > **PICARD**: In my century we don't succumb to revenge. We have a more evolved sensibility.
 >
 > **SLOANE**: Bullshit! I saw the look on your face when you shot those Borg on the holodeck. You were almost enjoying it!
 >
 > **PICARD**: How dare you!

First, again, it comforts me to know that Sloane also sees the gleeful murder, even calling it murder, and I promise that I wrote my assessment before getting to this scene.  He spouts these little self-compliments all the time, even though everybody[^lcEqq9] sees through the hypocrisy.

[^lcEqq9]:  Actually, when we get moving through **DS9**, we'll get another perspective on this, that people actually do believe it, and it messes them up emotionally, because it conflicts with what they actually feel, making it feel like they have something wrong with them.

Second, "how dare she," showing once again that he sees himself as having authority over civilians.

 > **SLOANE**: Oh! Hey! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your little quest. Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.
 >
 > **PICARD**: What?
 >
 > **SLOANE**: You do have books in the twenty-fourth century?

They do, but really only Shakespeare and some corporate slop from the 1930s, and [**Moby Dick**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick) doesn't fall into either category...

Also, how did we get **Enterprise** instead of a Lily Sloane series?  Nothing in the past two films tops this scene, and not primarily because of Patrick Stewart, and certainly none of **Enterprise** measures up to it...

 > **PICARD**: No! No! No! I will not sacrifice the *Enterprise*. We've made too many compromises already. Too many retreats. They invade our space and we fall back. They assimilate entire worlds, and we fall back. Not again! The line must be drawn here, this far, no further! And I will make them pay for what they've done.

I really don't want to seem like a jerk about this, but blowing up the ship would, in fact, draw that line.  The fact that this film exists proves that they can build another ship.

Also, "I will make them pay for what they've done" sounds awfully similar to what Sloane said about Picard's motivations, but---like the excursion to the deflector dish---Picard gets to look like a genius for having worked it out.

 > **PICARD**: *And he piled upon the whale's white hump, a sum of all the rage and hate felt by his own race. If his chest had been a cannon, he would have shot his heart upon it.*

A line *like* this appears in chapter XLI (also titled *Moby Dick*, as it turns out), but either gets a surprising amount of it wrong or Melville published an edition that differs significantly from the 1851 version that I can dig up.

 > **SLOANE**: Actually, I never read it.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Ahab spent years hunting the white whale that crippled him. A quest for vengeance, but in the end it destroyed him and his ship.

Thanks for mansplaining that, Jean-Luc.

"She did say that she never read the book, though..."

Yes, but she knew the *plot* of the book, otherwise the scene doesn't make any sense.  The near-miss quote, I can accept, but this more summarizes what Sloane berated him for, as if she never said anything.  Again, he gets credit for his brilliance after everybody else did the work while he repeated it too late to make a difference.

 > **PICARD**: Plenty of letters left in the alphabet. Mister Worf. I regret some of the things I said to you earlier.
 >
 > **WORF**: Some.

Right on, Worf.  If only the show had pushed back on Picard's nonsense for the entire run, instead of tiny bits every couple of seasons.

Also, Paramount will henceforth dedicate itself to making sure that we know about every single lettered *Enterprise*, even when it shouldn't matter.

 > **PICARD**: See you on Gravett Island.

The island seems fictional, which on one hand seems sensible because you shouldn't crash a bunch of pods where people live, but on the other makes no sense, because a complete society springing up where nobody lives will draw attention.

 > **COCHRANE**: Let's rock'n'roll!

We get [*Magic Carpet Ride*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_Ride_%28Steppenwolf_song%29), here, 1968 acid rock from Steppenwolf.  Why...?

 > **RIKER**: Can you turn that down a little?

...To show us that Riker doesn't approve of it any more than he did *Ooby Dooby* in the first half.

 > **COCHRANE**: Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shutdown and separation on my mark. Three, two, one, mark.

If I ever have an unlimited source of money, I think that I want a wall-sized screen that repeatedly plays a loop of Riker and La Forge both reaching to push buttons *right next to each other*, to justify having both of them (or either, for that matter) in the scene.

 > **PICARD**: Orders to find a quiet corner of North America and...stay out of history's way.

Has he maybe considered using *paper* for this?  That little tablet, even after they destroy it, will probably seem more than a bit suspicious.

 > **SLOANE**: Go and find your friend.

Not really important, I guess, but to go with this whole lack-of-planning vibe that they have going, I count about twenty-five pods.  They all come out of the same part of the ship, so maybe we have more, I don't know.  Each needs to have a large enough volume to protect at least one person during atmospheric reentry and crash-landing.  And I bring this up, because how do they intend to hide that much material and technology for at least a couple of centuries?  Do *they* have self-destruct devices?

 > **PICARD**: Offering myself? That's it. I remember now. It wasn't enough that you assimilate me. I had to give myself freely to the Borg, to you.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: You're lying. You wanted more than just another Borg drone. You wanted a human being with a mind of his own, who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the Borg. You wanted a counterpart, but I resisted. I fought you.

Hold up, there, this seems *way* more important than the way the scene sells it.  Unless I grossly misunderstand the lines, Picard has admitted that the Borg did not intend the events of *The Best of Both Worlds*---and possibly their entire entry into Federation space---as an attack or invasion, but rather to open (in effect) diplomatic relations with Earth.  And Picard would literally rather use his knowledge to destroy Starfleet and start a war endangering many billions of lives than ~~go to therapy~~ accept or even acknowledge that ambassadorial role.

I don't know if the writers intended this, and I certainly didn't catch it in 1996, but that interpretation actually pulls the entire Borg arc (minus **Voyager**, most likely) into sharp focus.  Who introduced the *Enterprise* to the Borg?  Q, in [*Q Who?*]({% post_url 2023-03-09-q-who %}), and you might recall that his entire interest in Picard and the crew, starting in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), revolved around testing them to see if they had a willingness to empathize with and learn to understand creatures and cultures entirely unlike their own.  In other words, this now sounds suspiciously like part of that test, challenging Picard on precisely his claims of human perfection.

Then, let's look at how the Borg don't really make any narrative sense as presented in their appearance.

- Prior to *Q Who?*, the Borg (or someone like them) vacuums up entire cities for no clear reason.
- *Q Who?* then presents them as scavengers who only care about technology, and have no interest at all in the people using it.  Technically, we only have Q's word on the behavior, but it later carries over to the idea that they don't attack anybody who they don't see as an immediate threat.
- In *The Best of Both Worlds*---whose title might now make more sense, too---the Borg have taken a sudden interest in the people using the technology, adding assimilation to their mission statement.  And they decide that they need a spokesperson, choosing the person who made the case to them that people matter.
- Then, in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}), we find that the Borg mostly feel sad and lonely, and the collective gives them support.
- In [*Descent*]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}), we find indications of the hive-mind disintegrating---maybe due to Hugh, maybe not---and latching onto anybody else who can give them direction and maybe support, even now creating flags to represent their factions.
- Now, while this script wants us to focus on Picard's revenge obsession, we see the Borg wanting their own revenge on Picard, seemingly alternating between a mortal enemy seeing an opportunity to hurt him and a jealous lover wanting him back.

Apart from the fact that the franchise treats them like some persistent, unstoppable juggernaut despite the collective only serving as antagonists for three episodes and Borg only appearing at all for six, so far, this has also always felt like uneven writing at best, writers changing the premise haphazardly in hopes of making something both threatening and more interesting than a faceless enemy; I have often dismissed them as the Bor(in)g, because the writers didn't seem to want any depth.  But now, Picard tells us that they assimilate looking for *volunteers*[^xlG7uK], people to help them plead some case to either Earth and/or the Federation, maybe because---unlike Data---they have realized that you can't dissect human culture and needs to understand it from its pieces.

[^xlG7uK]:  By the way, this also seriously calls into question the one seemingly legitimate concern about the Borg, that they compel their prisoners to fight for them, a fairly central war crime.  If everybody read and voluntarily accepted the EULA, though, then that no longer seems like a problem.  And yet, we'll need to talk about *different* war crimes at the end of the post.

In other words, I now need to ask if the Borg initially didn't realize that intelligent creatures inhabited the Federation (and surrounding regions) rather than piles of scrap, and awkwardly extended their hand in peace, which turned into a war because Picard refused to help, or even entertain the possibility of having a polite conversation with (gasp) communists.

Actually, we *could* mildly speculate on this, rather than limiting ourselves to putting explicit pieces together, and come to an even darker place quickly.  They seem to assert, in this exchange, that the Borg require some level of consent in assimilation, or at least did for Picard.  And yet, Picard claims to have refused that consent, even though we saw him (and later claims in the series confirmed it) orchestrate the attack on Starfleet, which sounds a *lot* like Picard killing thousands of his colleagues in order to block off any diplomatic solutions.  Not to mention that, at the end of *Q Who?*, he called the first encounter with the Borg a much-needed "kick in our complacency, to prepare us ready for what lies ahead," and we saw that followed by militarizing Starfleet, which an apology and ambassador from the Borg would surely undermine.

Incidentally, adding some possible depth to this, about six months after the film, on **Voyager**, we'll find out that the Borg have a war of attrition on their hands (*Scorpion*) that they probably won't win, at least strongly implying that they expand through that part of space (*Blood Fever*) because they can't think of any better plan than recruiting more bodies to throw at the problem.  Did the Borg come to the Federation for help, then, maybe even at Q's suggestion, setting up a much more interesting test than the goofy jellyfish?

I mean, surely the writers didn't have *this* deep a plan, even retroactively with lines like this, but it seems to me that the facts don't make sense any other way, except for my guesswork about Picard's time as Locutus, and that this fits the facts.

Also, back to the part that I crossed out as a cheap joke:  How has Picard stayed in his position for four or five years, when anybody can see that he has debilitating post-traumatic stress, putting his crew and ship at risk, and---as we have seen and as this outburst illustrates---still refuses to see a therapist?  I mean, episodes such as [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %}) and [*Thine Own Self*]({% post_url 2025-09-11-thine-own-self %}) do show that Starfleet places a high value on people who can send their colleagues to their deaths without remorse, but I would imagine that even they would have frowned on deliberately killing people begging for help, proposing dissolving all organic material in an area (including the crew) in hopes of killing a few enemies, putting the entire crew in danger, and setting the galaxy up for conquest, all because he doesn't want to show fear.

And that brings us up to the top, because even if we quietly ignore the effects of trauma because we don't want to suggest that Picard should "demean" himself by dealing with his psychological health, then the incident has also raised two separate ways that expose Picard as a merciless warmonger.  He took the Borg request for diplomatic help as an opportunity to wage war

 > **COCHRANE**: Engage.

DO YOU GET IT?  HE SAID THE THING.

 > **BORG QUEEN**: Destroy them. Watch your future's end. Data!

Wait, what?  Did she lose track of the plot or did I?  I could believe either, at this point, because I've had to pause this so many times to research things.  It doesn't really matter for the purposes of the post, I guess, but it seems like a bizarre choice.

Last I remember, they planned to assimilate twenty-first century Earth, when nobody has any way of defending themselves and with no organized governments.  Let the ship do its thing, and they get Vulcans with a working interstellar ship free of charge, too.  Shoot Cochrane out of the sky, though, and they'll need to develop a working interstellar propulsion system using twenty-first century materials.  Why interfere here, then?

Also, wouldn't blowing up the ship with torpedos draw as much attention from the Vulcans as transient whatever-readings?

 > **PICARD**: She was unique.

Immediately prior to this line, add to Picard's murder spree the inorganic remnants of that "unique" creature, when she posed no threat whatsoever.  And he only got to that point, because he finally got to do his "liquefy all organic material" thing.

And it seems a bit important to note that Picard's indiscriminate killing, even of incapacitated people, including in inhumane ways meant to inflict suffering, constitutes a bunch of counts of war crimes...assuming that the Federation has even declared war on the Borg, otherwise we "only" have many counts of torture and murder.  Should we have cheered for this creep because he did a bunch of **Die Hard** stuff (but not the clever parts) along the way?

 > Captain's log, April 5th 2063. The voyage of the *Phoenix* was a success, again. The alien ship detected the warp signature and is on its way to rendezvous with history.

It seems interesting that Picard now dismissively refers to it as "the alien ship."  Presumably, the writers wrote it this way as cheap, last-minute suspense, as if we couldn't guess what kind of creature would walk out of the ship.  But while I don't want to suggest that anybody would refer to this iteration of Starfleet as "woke," by any means, I can't imagine that a hypothetical Vulcan admiral tasked with reviewing Picard's work would see that moment of surprise for the audience beyond the fourth wall as useful.

 > **RIKER**: And they're going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship.

Why won't Riker stop staring at him?  Why does Riker always do the creepiest possible thing?

## Quick Commentary

What the Hell did I watch...?

First, did I imagine it, or have this film and [**Generations**]({% post_url 2025-12-04-star-trek-generations-1 %}) tried to mimic and remix the original-cast films instead of finding new ideas?  In the first outing, they gave us a story, which couldn't decide on a tone, about needing to stop a religious zealot, pretty much (as I said then) [**The Final Frontier**]({% post_url 2022-04-14-tff %}), plus making sure to destroy the *Enterprise* to match [**The Search for Spock**]({% post_url 2022-03-31-tsfs %}).  Now, we have the captain going renegade to reenact **Moby Dick**---straight out of [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %}), complete with a running theme of sacrificing colleagues---and using that rogue status to travel back in time to save the...well, not whales as such, but James Cromwell *does* do a lot of animal rights activism, sort of a discount [**The Voyage Home**]({% post_url 2022-04-07-tvh %}), complete with the sassy woman who doesn't tolerate the captain's emotional garbage and another callback to **The Final Frontier** in insisting that the crew needs to beat up on a bunch of commies.  Oh, plus, we also have the themes implying that Starfleet officials have engaged in a bunch of "false flag" attacks to preserve a state of war, straight out of [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}), even taking contrived steps so that Worf could make an appearance.

That already seems bad, and I now worry that **Insurrection** involves an angry *Sputnik* satellite plotting to ravage the Earth and an urgent need to rescue a mysteriously resurrected Jack Crusher while Spot sacrifices herself to shut down the warp core despite the radiation, to round out the missing plot beats.  Well, except that we also have a film, here, that begs us to applaud the main cast---except for the two women, who mostly stand around almost silently for two hours as if waiting for somebody to comment on their new hairstyles[^tG3Yrt]---while showing them as reckless and callous, even before we get to Picard committing war crimes with a smile on his face.

[^tG3Yrt]:  For those not watching along, I didn't say that for the sexist trope, though I *worded it* to take advantage of the trope.  Troi and Crusher both do sport new hairstyles, and it feels like the writers saw that as more than sufficient work on their characters' parts.

I think that I mentioned that---even without trying to tease apart the politics at the time---seeing this film in theaters largely burned me out on the franchise for many years.  Not long after this, I gave up on **Voyager**, with even the vastly superior **Deep Space Nine** not far behind, right as the latter started digging deep into its final arc, and I completely ignored **Enterprise**, only picking those shows back up when I started subscribing to television streaming services.  And I still---as I write this, shortly before Christmas Eve---haven't seen **Insurrection** or **Nemesis**, though I did read the anonymous heavily annotated-with-mocking-comments script for the latter that circulated on the Internet at the time.

And having now rewatched this slop for the first time in twenty-nine years, I can see why.  Even ignoring the overt xenophobic politics, they drenched every bit of this mess---notably except for Sloane---in cartoon testosterone while preaching that we primitives sitting in the audience can really only aspire to the advanced morality depicted, only barely seeming to recognize the hypocrisy and not remotely realizing that most people don't come to *Star Trek* for the mass killings.  Alongside the constant **Gilligan's Island** mess over in **Voyager**, plus having other responsibilities in my life at around this time, it didn't seem worth taking so much time out for this every week.

## Conclusions

Maybe I only rambled a lot, but it feels like we got a shocking amount of information out of this, beyond future-people hating popular twentieth century music after the 1930s.

### The Good

Worf, at least, has learned to push back against Picard.

### The Bad

Engineering education appears to focus on famous personalities.  Classes may also closely model their textbooks, to the point that students don't distinguish between the two.

People also broadly feel entitled to the time and attention of celebrities, looking for any conceivable connection to bond over, and refusing to leave them alone.  And shooting and kidnapping them to "preserve the timeline" feels entirely reasonable to them.

People from uncommon backgrounds, such as Klingons, reflexively explain their existence to new people.  They also find themselves ordered into situations known to make them uncomfortable and possibly put them in danger.

We also see a consistent lack of planning.  They don't bother to bring enough people for the number of Borg that they know lie ahead, and don't seem to have discussed how to stop them.  They readily accept that destroying the *Enterprise* wouldn't prevent it from falling into Borg hands.  And their "plan" to evacuate to the surface involves littering the surface with literal tons of futuristic material that would make it difficult to hide their presence.

While they object when directed at themselves on an individual basis, they seem comfortable characterizing safety as cowardly.  And people largely see life as cheap, at least for those without much power.

We continue to see the highly hierarchical society, both in how (almost) everybody accepts Picard's reckless orders uncritically and in how they assure us that they do so because personal loyalty trumps all other considerations.  Similarly, Picard seems to think that nobody has a right to criticize his actions.  And they also feel comfortable dismissing what women say so that they can take credit for almost precisely the same ideas.  Picard also seems to treat all extraterrestrial life as interchangeably "alien."

We also see at least Picard's hypocrisy shining through, as he insists that all humans have grown beyond violence and petty concerns, even as he gleefully murders multiple colleagues for revenge against someone else.  We also see that his alleged heroic role in stopping the Borg involved refusing to mediate between them and the Federation, despite their asking.  And even after he has allegedly pulled himself back from his murderous rage, he still opts to maliciously murder a defeated "enemy" who could no longer harm anybody.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the crew finds it strange that somebody powerful wants to use their surveillance of a culture for exploitation, in **Insurrection**.
