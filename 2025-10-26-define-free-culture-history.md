As I mentioned increasingly far back, somebody reached out to me asking a question that took me off guard.

![A logo representing Free Culture, featuring a sketch of three definitely generic modular brick toys stacked as a corner](/blog/assets/117878252_3c00463c07_o.png "I considered an alternate logo for this post, but I still don't hate this so much...")

To wit.

> What's Free Culture?

And sure enough, looking back on almost six years of this blog, it looks like I somehow never touched on that.  This embarrassed me quite a bit, since I often try not to sink into jargon.  I *have* talked about [the movement and its failings]({% post_url 2024-06-02-free-culture-movement %}) and [why I care so much]({% post_url 2023-06-25-free-culture %}) about the idea, not to mention spending every Saturday morning trying to strong-arm you into checking out some project via the [Free Culture Book Club](/blog/tag/book-club), yes.  But it doesn't look like I've ever defined the idea or how I see it.

## Recap

I kicked off that process of defining the idea about a month ago with something of an [elevator pitch for Free Culture]({% post_url 2025-09-21-define-free-culture-1 %}), defining the idea in terms of a slight variation on the four freedoms generally associated with the Free Software movement.

- The freedom to experience the work as you wish, without restriction
- The freedom to study the work, and to create derivative works that say what you want
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others without restriction

I also talked a bit about why this might matter to us, especially in an age of constant media consolidation.  After that, I tried to use historical quotes about art and cooperation to outline a modern [philosophy of Free Culture]({% post_url 2025-10-05-free-culture-philosophy %}) not reliant on opposition to copyright or other individualistic, libertarian positions that uphold tropes like abusive lone geniuses.  I summarized the results with this minimal statement.

> Humans need to create and share, creating culture; Free Culture sees this as an inalienable right.

This oversimplifies away the idea that we make art to connect with others---our inspirations, our peers/audience, and those who we ultimately inspire---because everybody has something to contribute to the culture, but for less than a hundred characters, it probably passes muster.

This time through, I want to talk a bit about how we got here, because the space hasn't always looked like people deliberately building connection to fulfill some central human need.  Therefore, let's glance over our shoulders, because the situation can grow (somewhat) dicier from here.

## Fan Fiction and Similar

Informal versions of Free Culture have always existed, in a sense, because copyright holders have wide discretion in whether they want to prosecute any given instance of infringement[^CDTMJP], and haven't always had much authority to do so.  Jonathan Swift's [**Gulliver's Travels**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels) (1726), for example, inspired a seemingly endless array of what we would now identify as fan fiction, including unauthorized sequels and deeper explorations of popular events from the book.  Similarly, Johann Wolfgang Goethe's [**The Sorrows of Young Werther**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther) (1774) inspired *Werther Fever*, where young Europeans in droves dressed as the author described Werther, acting in character as they went through their days, in effect *sturm und drang*'s version of Trekkies.  I can't find any evidence of Swift's or Goethe's reaction to any of them, and most of the world didn't really see derivative works as part of copyright until the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) (1886), but the fact remains that many popular works spawned not only imitators, but direct adaptation.

[^CDTMJP]:  Compare that with trademark law, where if you fail to "vigorously" sue for any infringement, you risk losing the trademark.  If you don't defend your brand, even once, even out of ignorance of the infringement, then courts assume that you don't care if somebody impersonates your organization.  If you have ever wondered why Disney sometimes gets in the news for suing some hospital for painting Mickey and Minnie Mouse on the walls of the children's ward despite the terrible optics of attacking kids with cancer, or why every significant organization has a page on their website explaining when and how you have permission to use their logo, this distinction between copyright and trademark undergirds most of that.

As the closest to a creator commenting positively on derived works that I can find, a friend apparently convinced Harriet Beecher Stowe---who had refused to authorize adaptations, even though producers would have paid her at least twice what she earned from the novel itself[^BWh4k0], because she didn't care for drama *or* capitalism---to attend George Aiken's stage production of [**Uncle Tom's Cabin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin) (1852), and she described herself as delighted by Caroline Howard's version of Topsy.  But like I said, until Berne, creators didn't have much recourse if they didn't like it.

[^BWh4k0]:  I would bet that this also accounts for the novel's poor reputation, such as using "Uncle Tom" as slur against non-white institutionalists and enablers of oppression against their own demographic, despite the tiny detail that the character routinely stands up for himself, his friends, and his family throughout the story, even as he suffers for his actions.  Since adaptations didn't go through Stowe, their politics landed all over the map, and no doubt many adaptations in the antebellum South built and capitalized on those pro-slavery versions that we'd now consider piracy.

Actually, we could probably throw one tongue-in-cheek reference to this phenomenon, which comes off as a solicitation for fan involvement, from Laurence Sterne's [**The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman) (1759), where the book's narrator explains.

> To conceive this right, call for pen and ink---here's paper ready to your hand.  Sit down, Sir, paint her to your own mind---as like your mistrels as you can---as unlike your wife as your conscience will let you---'tis all one to me---please put your own fancy in it.

And the book follows this with a blank page, bringing the reader into the creative process, even if only as a joke.

Following that, as most of you know, many of those traditions have continued to today, evolving in some ways into entire communities of people who enjoy creating without authorization in the context of popular fictional universes.  Some of these occasionally become so popular that the authors change the names and spin off their own standalone works.  Some creators (or studios) condone or ignore these unauthorized works, at least in some contexts, while others never miss an opportunity to rage against their inability to control how people enjoy their work.

Likewise, throughout modern history, you can find plenty of authors who absolutely did *not* appreciate imitations of their work.  The second part of [**The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote) (1615) has an entire passage where the characters mock and complain about an unauthorized continuation of their adventures that became popular during the ten years between parts, for a clear example, showing that many writers did feel a sense of ownership over their creations.  Some probably always have, despite the insistence of the people opposed to copyright---more about that later in the post---that something (increasingly, capitalism gets the blame) spoiled our ancestral consensus of creative works in some communal possession that everybody loved.

## Copyright's Expansion

Anyway, as we move forward in time, copyright has covered broader aspects of artistic work, and so we have increasingly seen creators---often authors---actively inviting fans to mess around in their fictional universes or overtly opposing it.  Granted, for much of history, such authors saw little risk of fans *publishing* their fan-works, and authors often revoked that informal permission whenever they felt threatened[^Ctbfth], but both sentiments existed.

[^Ctbfth]:  For a sometimes-popular example, apart from his white supremacist personal politics---he advised the United States government to spread rumors of unethical medical practices to scare Latine people away from hospitals in an emergency---[Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven) has spoken about wanting fans to make his *Known Space* stories "their own," then later threatened to sue writers who actually did so.  Because copyright-holders have all discretion in whether and when to enforce their monopolies, he can do that legitimately.

You probably already have some sense of all this.  If you need a refresher on the broad history of copyright law, though, I covered it early in the run of the blog in post primarily about [performing copyright searches]({% post_url 2020-07-19-pdomain %}).

And now it gets a bit more...bothersome, I guess.  In the United States, the [Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONTU) convinced the United States Congress in 1980 to add software to the kinds of works covered by copyright.  The ability for companies to "seal off" work that everybody previously considered in the public domain---a utilitarian sequence of instructions, or *arguably* applied mathematics, neither of which qualifies for copyright---making it therefore illegal to fix somebody else's software bugs or adapt their software for different requirements[^CPoXMR].  That change led to the start of the aforementioned Free Software movement, building a parallel body of software that anybody could use, study, distribute, and modify without needing to acquire the proprietor's permission.

[^CPoXMR]:  It also created a bizarre situation where novel kinds of software, which the 1980s saw a lot of, could receive *multiple* kinds of intellectual property protection.  By publishing the software, owners receive lengthy copyright protection.  And by applying to a different office, the owners would also receive *patent* protection, keeping direct competitors out of the market for twenty years.  To my knowledge, intellectual property law doesn't treat anything else in that way.

Back to the cultural side, as we slid to the end of the twentieth century in the United States, Congress passed the [Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act) to tack twenty years onto all current copyright terms, followed the next day by the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) to make a bunch of changes to the law, such as the following.

- Grant retroactive copyright to works created in countries that signed onto certain Intellectual Property treaties, as if the author had managed their copyrights properly at home
- Protect the hull designs of ships
- Ban the circumvention of digital locks, allowing companies to control audience access through [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)
- Increase the penalties for infringement if it happens on the Internet
- Create a "safe harbor" for service providers, protecting them from liability from user-provided content that violates their moderation policies, provided that they act on take-down requests

Some of those items benefit or offend more than others.  Safe harbor laws put most websites that rely on user input on equal footing, where sites (affirmatively) don't need to expend labor on every post to verify its copyright status to protect themselves from liability, something that Facebook can comfortably afford, but your local Mastodon instance probably can't, and so would destroy most independent websites without it.  But making copyright infringement worse if you use a network---because transmitting files makes temporary copies on every router and switch between you and the destination, even though few people can access them, and copyright gives the owner the right to control *copying*---makes a lot of normal behavior, such as quoting passages from books or sharing favorite songs, legally risky, presumptively illegal instead of requiring the copyright holder to prove guilt.

And the majority of those changes combined to say that---for a popular example---certain British films whose American copyrights had expired suddenly had valid copyrights again, plus at least twenty more years of copyright protection, despite many bootleg DVDs already sold and download sites already hosting them.  If you've ever tried to figure out why different sites, and sometimes different pages on the same site, have different opinions on the copyright status of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest work, that resulted from the law changing as it became viable for someone other than a big studio to distribute the films to a broad audience.

### Professional Circles

It probably doesn't matter much, but while thinking about the era during which copyright expanded, it occurs to me that we have a few instances that resemble Free Culture.  Especially in the first half of the twentieth century, magazines often became hubs, after a fashion, allowing writers and fans to publish their mailing addresses and often passing letters along for interested readers.

As a result, sprinkled through this time, you see groups such as the so-called Lovecraft Circle[^l5zMt7] in the 1920s, an assortment of (quasi-professional) "weird fiction" writers who befriended and began encouraging each other to use elements of their own writing in new stories, creating a sloppy sort of shared universe.  In the Soviet Union and other places, the samizdat movement, underground self-publishing zines, similarly sometimes encouraged peers to republish and adapt work.

[^l5zMt7]:  It seems like a shame that we can't find a term for the group that *doesn't* center on the raging white supremacist weirdo who obsessively turned yonic symbols into monsters.

While these circles don't have Free Culture's signature idea of not differentiating between the creator and audience, they seem to have done so to the extent that the technology would allow, given that magazines often gave motivated readers their easiest entry into publishing their work.

## Opposition to Copyright

And because Congress for the first time extended the lengths of copyrights already granted, many people---including myself, by the way---feared that this would pretty much end the growth of the public domain, since the precedent would allow the government keep extending terms indefinitely.  That fear resulted in [*Eldred v Ashcroft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft), challenging the constitutionality of the Copyright Term Extension Act.  [Larry Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig) led Eldred's legal representation in front of the Supreme Court, and...by all accounts (including his own) "phoned it in," as they say, thinking that the bare facts spoke for themselves, so they lost.

Mind you, normal people didn't think of Supreme Court cases as political forums where you need to sway nine humans on an emotional level at the time, or at least a place where you shouldn't dryly lecture them on the text of laws and the Constitution and expect them to upend law for you, so Lessig became something of an Internet folk hero, and the [Free Culture movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement) sprung up around the defeat, followed closely by Lessig helping to found [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/).  As I have described elsewhere, Creative Commons wanted to deal with (or capitalize on, if you have a more cynical bend) the anger at copyright term extensions, the ongoing fight against music sampling in hip hop, and the attacks on Napster.

And that history, I think, gets at my previously described problems with how the movement has operated in the past, and has the seeds of what I think that it probably needs to do instead, which we'll get into some other time.

## The Schism

If you looked at that last Wikipedia link describing the Free Culture movement, you'll notice that it gets a description that seems contrary to what I described in prior posts of the series.  In the second paragraph, for example, you'll see this.

> The movement objects to what it considers over-restrictive copyright laws. Many members of the movement argue that over-restrictive laws hinder creativity and create a "permission culture", which they worry will shrink the public domain and fair use.

If you have followed my writing for a while, you know that I find this...well, not *inaccurate*, because many people have certainly bought into this idea[^q0Rgrv], but problematic.  I do agree that copyright has grown too burdensome, but I see it as related as, for example, the movement for universal health care and combatting the opioid crisis, in that the latter could drive you to supporting the former, but the movements have different results in mind, the former could make the latter easier, and the former has many more benefits.  Both movements have valid reasons for participation, but conflating the two doesn't help either one.

[^q0Rgrv]:  I like to use the example that, when we started to see the AI companies pillaging the Internet, scarfing down any *content* that they could reach, a lot of Free Software and Free Culture dingbats showed up to say that, gosh, this all seems terrible, but since the movements' founders oppose copyright, and we support those movements, then shouldn't we celebrate the coal-burning plagiarism machine, actually?

You might note that Creative Commons still hasn't let this focus on the public domain go.  Possibly hoping to get people to pretend that the whole [AI Signals debacle]({% post_url 2025-06-29-signal-change %}) didn't happen, they recently rolled out their nonsensical or meaningless (I still haven't decided) [Open Heritage Statement](https://openheritagestatement.org/), an empty call (to nobody in particular) to digitize and post public domain material, because they have trained their core audience to reflexively hate restrictions on the public domain.

I've said this before, and implied it above, but opposition to copyright doesn't enable or drive anything.  To use the frame of the previous post in this series, at best it creates negative liberties---a lack of enforcement that certain people can take advantage of---and mostly shrugs its shoulders.  It doesn't care about advancing the culture or building community, and often wants to atomize us and reify the past, because it turns us into consumers and packagers[^5mtYI2].  Fighting copyright doesn't provide space for any positive liberties, because it doesn't seek to empower anybody.

[^5mtYI2]:  Actually, it seems worth noting that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, specifically the ban on circumventing "digital locks," created an awful little cottage industry of people scraping up public domain material to create "information products" that did nothing more than repackage the sources with some Digital Rights Management software so that they could pretend to own it.  If you look around, you can probably still find plenty of websites trying to convince readers that they can make money by creating new copyrights on public domain material by asserting control over the text layout and fonts, too...

And from the hard-headed perspective of organizing, by trying to make Free Culture look like a "toy" version of the public domain, you might notice that the Free Culture movement often loses people to causes such as media preservation/piracy.  After all, it sounds more heroic to upload an old video game so that people can find it when its copyright lapses than it does to reach out to an author after proofreading their writing, even though the latter probably makes a bigger positive impact by cooperating with somebody.  Therefore, it doesn't make much practical sense to treat copyright reform as a central idea to Culture Freedom.

Similarly, I've mentioned before in [talking about copyright]({% post_url 2025-05-18-copyright-thoughts %}) that only two forms of governance really function and can settle into a stable state, democracy and oligarchy.  Monarchs eventually need to share power to administer everything.  And in the absence of prepared force willing to defend people, petty warlords arise to gobble up territory and *become* that prepared force.  The public domain operates on anarchic principles, with nobody in charge.  Everybody "owns" the works, hence the term, in the domain of the public.  And what happens?  Some works become disproportionately popular, metaphorical oligarchs, and some creators make "their" proprietary versions that you can't touch, stereotypical warlords taking advantage of a power vacuum.  Likewise, strong copyright operates on monarchical principles, with a single owner who decides the destiny of their empire...but because marketing, sales, and other management takes additional skills and investment, most authors sell or license their work to [one of the five-to-ten companies working in their medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership), as close to a literal oligarchy as you can get.

Free Culture, when it works, operates on democratic principles.  It resists centralizing power by sharing that power, and it resists spreading power so thin that a notional warlord can wrest control of a property from its community, by maintaining responsibility for that material in the community.

## Licenses

I didn't specifically mention this as I went through the origins of the Free Software and the Free Culture movements, because it'll get its own post soon enough.  But along with the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons, among other organizations working to enable the various movements, we saw the creation of *public licenses*.  Let me (briefly, I hope) explain.

Legally speaking, licenses in general provide official permission to do something, under certain conditions, almost identical to a contract, where one party (the licensor) agrees not to sue the other (the licensee) for exercising the granted permission, provided that the licensee doesn't violate the terms under which they received that permission.  We all probably have some familiarity with a driver's license, for example, which grants conditional permission to operate a motor vehicle on public roads within a certain jurisdiction.  Some careers have licensing around them, where you may not practice that occupation without some organization granting you permission contingent on following various regulations.  Copyright licenses work along similar lines, where a licensee receives permission from the creator of some work protected by copyright to use that work in some agreed-upon ways.  Licenses, as I often say, *let* you do something[^dA1nC_].

[^dA1nC_]:  I'll get to this in a later post, but I point out that licenses can only ever let you do things, because opposition to Free Culture has given us the absurd idea of "restrictive licenses"---those licenses that require you to give back to the community when you use something, in effect---as if a license can *ever* take away your rights.

In a subset of copyright cases---music in particular, in the United States---we have developed a regime of [compulsory licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license), where to facilitate the spontaneity of (non-dramatic) live performances, organizations have already negotiated the license, so that you never need to *ask* for permission, but you do need to pay the standard fee whenever you take advantage of that permission, in a sense applying "easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" to actual law.  Patents also fall under this category, on occasion, when the industry deems a technology so important that having every interested party negotiate their own permission would bog the entire system down.

Don't worry, I won't actually *try* (at least, not for this post), but I think that we could potentially make the argument that public licenses will end up ranking as one of the most important recent innovations---hence my talking about it with the concept's history---because they take compulsory licensing a step further.  Rather than negotiating or applying for a license, and rather than paying for a license after using it, a public license says that everybody receives permission in advance, as long as they comply with the conditions.

Maybe you remember how I outlined the philosophy of Free Culture, centering it on the human need to connect with people who we might never meet?  As I said, we'll talk about why and how soon enough, but a well-crafted public license can power that process, skipping around any obstacles that the "defaults" of law might have put into place, and empowering people to join us and contribute.

## Coming Soon

I may have missed some eddies in the historical flow, but this post should give some sense of how Free Culture arose and became what you see today, both the good and the bad.

And once again, we'll end here, so that this doesn't become some unhinged manifesto.  But when I return to the topic for the fourth post in the series, probably in a couple of weeks, we'll turn from the past back to (some approximation of) the present, and look at Free Culture as a mechanism to grant and protect the four freedoms in ways that resonate with the broader philosophy, including (I suspect) licenses.

See you then...
