This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) stars reading plays funded by Wikimedia Italia.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  Theatre projects funded by Wikimedia Italia, **Sulle orme di Papert** (**In the Footsteps of Papert**) this time
 * Location:  <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Theatre_projects_funded_by_Wikimedia_Italia>
 * Released:  2021
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Various, Danilo Zuliani this time
 * Medium:  Plays
 * Length:  Approximately seven thousand words, this time through
 * Content Advisories:  Nothing really comes to mind

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Wikimedia Italia

The page only really says this:

> Theatre projects funded by Wikimedia Italia.

However, one of the documents provides a [full overview of the event](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bando_WMI_wiki_teatro_libero_2020.pdf), including this premise.

> Il presente bando "Wiki teatro libero" è emesso da Wikimedia Italia – Associazione per la diffusione della conoscenza libera (WMI) ( www.wikimedia.it ) nell'ambito delle sue attività per la diffusione, miglioramento e avanzamento del sapere, della cultura e delle possibilità di accesso alla conoscenza.
>
> E' condotto in collaborazione con Italian Linux Society.

Or, in English, that reads as follows.

> "Wiki Free Theatre" is issued by Wikimedia Italia – Association for the dissemination of free knowledge (WMI) (www.wikimedia.it) within its activities for the dissemination, improvement and advancement of knowledge, culture and the possibility of access to knowledge.
>
> It is conducted in collaboration with the Italian Linux Society.

Looking at the titles, you can get a sense of the general shape of the project, though.  Three of them cite [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) in the title.  Another refers to [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning).  Others refer to "free knowledge" or women in mathematics---specifically [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether)---and so forth.

This time through, I only had time to investigate and read one of the plays, **Sulle orme di Papert** (**In the Footsteps of Papert**).  It doesn't include any dialogue, but if you want a feel for the intended presentation, they recorded a montage of different scenes.  Beware the loud music, though, depending on where you choose to watch it.

As you can guess, despite (or because of) my family name, I can't read much more Italian than guesswork from English root words and occasional similarity to French, so I'll read these in (machine) translation.  We all, I hope (especially by now) understand how that means that I might miss critical nuance or clever lines.

## What Works Well?

The premise---an improvised lecture series with a "maybe not quite interested" audience---makes sense and has a lot of opportunity to play with the format and content.  You can imagine collapsing the lecture audience with the show's audience in some environments, but maintaining a distinction in others, for example, without needing to alter the story.  Related, you'll notice in the video (and header image) that they might have staged it with the fictional audience at the *rear* of the stage, so that writing on the board cleverly means facing the real-world audience.

And while this digs into taste, I enjoyed some of the material.  The "creation" of the robot feels appropriate for the stage.  A few jokes land well.  Papert's final speech doesn't quite survive the translation, but still has a compelling sentiment.  And while it doesn't quite manifest, LOGO comes as close to a "theatrical" language as you'll probably find, since a character could follow the instructions to demonstrate, without needing any technology.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Unless I missed something clever in the original Italian, this play feels like it could've used a *lot* of trimming.  The first scene felt to me like bland attempts at banter, then the second scene opens with---and for the first time I get to say this in the most literal sense---a dramatic reading of [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert)'s Wikipedia entry.  Worse, when we finally get to the alleged point, presenting [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29), it skips through that to show only the smallest piece of a fairly clever language.  Maybe I took that a bit too personally, since I really enjoyed LOGO as a child.

It also feels like the characters don't quite line up.  The front-matter promises us somebody who represents experience-based teaching, one theory, and the experimental subject...plus Papert in "an imaginary video call from the past."  But the two modern people, for all their bickering, don't seem to have much difference in approach.

## Opportunities

In one sense, I doubt the possibility, since the event ended five years ago, and we only have PDF files and some preview footage.

However, this coming out of Wikimedia, it "only" takes consensus-building (and maybe money) to get other parts of the organization to replicate the project.

## What's Adaptable?

The time-traveling video call probably demands the most attention.  But the dialogue also refers to classes in expanded pedagogy, bimbology of the modern and contemporary era, existential periodic elements of the infant in the era of
computers, and cooking technology management (specializing in "oven").

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll take on a couple of the smaller plays...though I reserve the right to change direction on that during the week.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about this play?
