* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > This type of media coverage ‚Äì highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles‚Äô backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways ‚Äì would dog them throughout their marriage.

Eastman, you might note, has reared his head frequently in the quotes that I dig up, as one of the few nineteenth century Native Americans to have recorded many thoughts not specifically focused on the era.  It feels appropriate, then, to share an article specifically about him.

Admittedly, I don't have much of a connection to this world, so I try to keep my mouth shut, but all the evidence that I've seen has always pointed me to a similar conclusion, that while valid political reasons exist to group these conditions together, it doesn't seem like a single thing at all.

This gets to the heart of why I get so angry when people compare the situation today to classic dystopian novels such as **The Handmaid's Tale** or **The Parable of the Sower**.  You've probably heard me say this before, but I find it worth repeating:  The authors didn't write their books to warn you about some hypothetical future.  They wrote about what they saw happening *in front of them* and wanted you to care about it as if it also happened to you.  Hell, **It Can't Happen Here** outlined a lot of what we see today ninety years ago, not to mention **The Iron Heel** almost thirty years before that.

Rather than express shock, you have a responsibility to educate yourself.

I know.  A big company collects government IDs to verify people's ages, and immediately that sensitive information ends up potentially putting those people in danger.  You could almost think that this obsession with verifying people never accomplishes much more than endangering people...

I know, shocking news here, that treating your body well makes parts of that body healthier.  But as usual, it probably helps to have actual data.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://wagingnonviolence.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/12-step-programs.png|People on a large staircase, some helping others up|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How 12-step programs can help build healthier movements](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/10/how-12-step-programs-can-help-build-healthier-movements/) from Waging Nonviolence

 > In a hyper-capitalist society, regaining any power of choice is resistance. The revolutions in thought also have to uproot specific indoctrinations. Step One is admitting we‚Äôre powerless over our coping mechanism and that we need help. Step Two is believing that help is available, and Step Three is deciding to ask for that help. These three steps together are a break from rugged individualism.

I like this idea a lot.  Even though I have no personal experience with these sorts of programs and understand that many have had trouble with them, I have often wondered about repurposing the broad concepts, because it distributes and decentralizes the organization to make it feel personal.  Mostly, I have tried to think about it in terms of education, but this probably fits far better.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Declaring War on the American People](https://otherwords.org/declaring-war-on-the-american-people/) from OtherWords

 > Here‚Äôs what that war looked like in Chicago recently: federal agents rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter [onto an apartment building in the middle of the night](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/us/chicago-apartment-ice-raid), border patrol agents breaking into apartments and [allegedly zip-tying young children (though DHS denies they were zip-tied)](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/10/08/children-zip-tied-chicago/), detaining American citizens, and leaving people‚Äôs apartments and belongings trashed.

You might remember that, shortly after Trump's second term started, I posted about [not doing the authoritarian work for them]({% post_url 2025-02-09-resist %}).  Near the end of that, I mentioned Trump referring to his policies using "shock and awe" tactics, a term that we use for military actions meant to demoralize an enemy.  It shouldn't surprise *anybody* that he has begun invading the country, because he has always seen us as a belligerent nation.  And this will probably need to end in regime change.

Speaking of which...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Anti-Corruption Politics May Be the Key to Beating Trumpism](https://jacobin.com/2025/10/corruption-democrats-trump-oligarchy-midterms/) from Jacobin

 > For Democrats, this particular moment of cartoonish graft presents a huge opportunity to unify around an anti-corruption platform ‚Äî one that goes beyond obvious Band-Aids like congressional [stock-trading bans](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kelly-ossoff-reintroduce-congressional-stock-trading-ban/) and Trump-trolling reforms like prohibitions on foreign government [gifts](https://apnews.com/article/congress-emoluments-trump-raskin-house-oversight-d7400a67dec40940fe76fbaa57feda9c). Their agenda must meet the moment and include game-changing initiatives that let voters know they recognize corruption is pervasive ‚Äî initiatives that create publicly financed campaigns, broaden federal bribery statutes, and enact a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 _Citizens United_ decision.

This article has some problems, mostly typical pseudo-left tics making sure that they try to court fictional right-wing readers by bashing Democrats and trying to re-litigate Bernie Sanders.  But it makes a valid point that corruption makes a good wedge to get at other issues.  Republican voters dismiss claims of corruption as something that everybody does, so actually taking stands can go a long way of disrupting support for the worst of the worst.
