As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Oh, we have [Picked Last on the National Hero Playground Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day), too, if you need your annual dose of genocide and fraud.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The government, under then Prime Minister Mugabe, deployed a specialized army unit known as the Fifth Brigade to the western parts of the country — strongholds of the opposition PF-ZAPU.

I hope that they can get past this unfortunate situation compounded by a disinterest by some parties in getting to the truth.

 > For decades, people have known the chemical-propulsion approach to space travel is really not going to get us that far. Chemical propulsion is essentially like the horse-and-cart approach to the exploration of the American West, instead of the steamboat or the railroad.

Their target of fifty steps seems worryingly low, suggesting that either benefits *start* there, or most people with heart disease could benefit from almost any exercise at all.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
