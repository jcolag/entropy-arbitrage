As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Some activists focused on the Palestinian territories Israel has occupied since 1967, which they consider a departure from the country‚Äôs ideals as a Jewish democracy. Others found themselves in complete disagreement with the idea of Zionism, given how the creation of the new state necessitated Palestinian displacement.

I increasingly hear the pro-Palestinian protests dismissed as people not knowing the situation on the ground, like every other protest movement, but---oh, look---people who absolutely know the situation, and still protest...

 > The posts flagged by the University of Texas-Austin are not about organizing at UT-Austin, and do not mention any planned actions there. More broadly, the posts lay out the organization‚Äôs stances and strategies for university protests across the country, including ‚Äúcoordinated pressure campaigns against university administrators.‚Äù

The reaction against the protests continues to impress me in its absurd panic and complete disassociation from facts.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Abortion #ReproductiveHealth

I'd say that this article drastically under-sells the need.  More than making more laws that vaguely say that, under most circumstances never to get strong definitions, pregnant people may consider getting abortions, we need a system that *supports* them in getting abortions, and strict boundaries around when it becomes unacceptable.  Otherwise, we'll end up back in the country's system under *Roe v Wade*, when sure, you could get an abortion legally, but good luck for most of the country in actually making that happen.

 > Economists recognize that the economy is much better under Biden than it was under Trump. So why do polls keep showing that Americans aren‚Äôt giving Biden any credit? And why do 74% of swing state voters say inflation is getting worse even though that's not true?

Hashtags:  #USPol #Economy

I can't tell you *exactly* why, but I'd bet that the full answer involves a lot of corporate sabotage.  Whenever the economy does well---under Democrats, since Republican policies always exfiltrate money from the economy to the wealthy---we consistently see the same handful of moves from the corporate world.

 * Corporate executives whine that workers have too much power, and nobody wants to work anymore.
 * Monopolies hike prices on everything, blaming "inflation."
 * Technology companies lay off significant percentages of their workforce.
 * The same technology companies insist that, real soon now, they'll have a tool that can automate away every job.
 * The media talks about how people "feel the pinch," without questioning which fingers have pinched who.

In other words, if billionaires can't have a bad economy for the Republicans to campaign on, then they'll *create* one, even if their decisions hurt their business interests.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > In anticipation of the meeting, the Strategic Organizing Center released its own Amazon injury data report, which found that the injury rate at Amazon warehouses was more than twice the industry standard.

I have a small amount of money in the stock market---nothing related to Amazon---but have seen similar proposals for other companies, always with the board strongly recommending against them.

You can presumably guess how I voted, for all the good my four or five shares of a company will do...
