## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Nemesis

Picking up where we left off, Picard and Data (posing as B-4) looking for a way off the *Scimitar*...

 > **DATA**: Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots...

Ah, gotta love the AI-chatbot approach of interpreting your request as an opportunity to riff on things that you would have already seen on a cursory search, instead of actually attempting to solve your problem.

 > **PICARD**: Data, what do you imagine this is?
 >
 > **DATA**: Port thruster, sir. Would you like me to drive, sir?

I feel the need to emphasize, here, that Data had trouble parsing the language, but Picard feels like he can guess his way through flying a fighter craft.  And when Data politely implies the potential problem, there, he glares, because---once again---we don't have anything more important to worry about than his ego.

 > **PICARD**: He could only have built a weapon of such scope for one reason. He's going after Earth.
 >
 > **TROI**: How can you be certain?
 >
 > **PICARD**: I know how he thinks.

Did Picard admit to fantasizing about destroying Earth so that he could conquer the Federation?  It *sounds* like he did.

 > **RIKER**: Destroy humanity, you cripple the Federation.

Have we ever gotten an explanation for why they all treat Earth as only useful part of the Federation?  Everybody pretty much agrees (in our world, I mean) that the Federation serves as a proxy for the United States, and I can't think of a single target where any significant number of people would think the same way about the country.  If you destroyed Washington, DC, then we have succession plans and state governments.  If you destroyed an influential or economically powerful state, not much would change.  What, then, makes Earth so necessary that destroying it would put the Federation in dire straits?

 > Captain's Personal log, supplemental. We're heading toward Federation space at maximum warp. The crew has responded with the dedication I've come to expect of them. And like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields, I wait for the dawn.

He considers himself more of an explorer, though, you know...?

 > **PICARD**: *For now we see but through a glass darkly*...

The line comes from [1 Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians) [13:12](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/1_Corinthians#Chapter_13), this particular version seeming to come from the King James Bible, one of many different translations disagreeing on context.  Some translations do veer more in the direction of seeing one's flaws in the mirror, but others point more at seeing the worst in people before we get to know them.  That all seems like it obscures Picard's point...

We have seen hints of Picard identifying as a sort of popular culture Christian---such as believing in a red-tights-and-pitchfork devil in [*Devil's Due*]({% post_url 2024-02-01-devil-s-due %})---but this seems like the first time that any of this group has given an indication of knowing anything about a religion.

By the way, you all know what this means, though, right?  By referencing this part of the Bible, knowing it off the cuff as if he has had it on his mind anyway, Picard *totally* went for the "love is patient, love is kind" wedding cliché from 1 Corinthians 13:4--8, only a few short lines above the dark glass thing, if translated as *charity* in King James...

And who knows, maybe they wrote this to make up for the lack of plot points directly stolen from earlier films, this referencing [Ricardo Montalbán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Montalb%C3%A1n)'s commercials for the Chrysler [Cordoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Cordoba) and its *rich, Corinthian leather*.  I doubt it, because nothing about this film suggests clever references, but when you have three prior films acting like the [ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) eating its tail and Corinth-adjacent material entering the conversation, I couldn't not mention it...

 > **DATA**: I aspire, sir, to be better than I am. B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

Nor does Picard, as he has reminded us many times over fifteen years.  Humanity has evolved past needing to evolve past things, and all that.  You notice, though, how quickly they use this to dismiss a person's value.

Also, though, let's not forget that Shinzon has gone from discarded experiment to slave laborer to conscripted soldier to military leader to coalition-building emperor over his former oppressors, and now wants to eliminate the foreign power that keeps his government penned behind the Neutral Zone.  They may disagree on the utility of those last steps, but Shinzon he doesn't aspire, then I don't know what bar he needs to clear, especially when contrasted against the rich kids who sit around playing poker.

And seriously, don't ignore the classism in this.  Not all people have equal access to opportunities, or even *visions* of opportunities, to advance that make those aspirations reasonable.  But they have no problems smearing poor kids, who may not see themselves as bettering their lives, as probably not worth worrying about.

 > **PICARD**: Commander, when this is over, I owe you a drink.

Given his monologues to Shinzon about always having time to grow, did Picard finally accept that a non-human with more power than him doesn't necessarily need to present a threat...?

 > **TROI**: Captain, I think I may have a way to find them.

The therapist finally makes herself useful...as a weapon, because certainly nobody here needs therapy...

 > **PICARD**: Fire at will!

Sure, Riker has annoyed me for all this time, too, but...

 > **WORF**: The Romulans fought with honor.

OK, but what does that have to do with anything?  It feels like they might as well talk about something on TV.

 > **PICARD**: Medical team to the bridge.

All this time, they had a window there, not a video display...?

 > **SHINZON**: Captain, as much as I enjoy listening to you talk, I really think...

Heh.  I knew that Picard lived to hear the sound of his own voice.

 > **SHINZON**: Divert all power to engines! Full reverse.

Not relevant to this line, but shortly before, as they wreck yet another *Enterprise*, it seems worth pointing out that, where a typical action film would have Riker offer to save the viceroy's life before the struggling causes him fall, here, Riker outright murders him while the viceroy doesn't appear to pose any threat.

 > **PICARD**: It's not about me anymore.

I don't know, he still seems willing to *make* it about him...

 > **SCIMITAR COMPUTER**: Two minutes to firing sequence.

I feel like whatever super-strength that Picard has to rip the handle-thing out of the wall should have come up before now, for foreshadowing at least, if not having a scene that actually makes some sense.  Can we stop with this midlife crisis masculinity trash, already...?

 > **TROI**: Data?

He has been and always will be your friend, or something, because we need to hit every single plot point from the original-cast films...

 > **TROI**: Thank you.

Bold move handing out glasses of your own company's wine at the memorial service, Jean-Luc.

 > **RIKER**: The first time I saw Data, he was leaning against a tree in the holodeck trying to whistle. Funniest thing I ever saw. No matter what he did he couldn't get the tune right. What was that song? I can't remember the song.

Hey, remember [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-26-farpoint2 %}), when Riker---in his first random outburst of racism---both referred to Data as the heartless Tin Man and questioned his credentials?  Oh, and he also "helped" Data finish whistling *Pop Goes the Weasel*, but mostly the other things in that scene.

By the way, you'll notice that, for I believe the first time, they actually express grief, instead of bottling it up for some hypothetical future time.  It took the death of a member of their "nuclear family," rather than the thousands or even millions of deaths that they've witnessed (or caused), but they finally sort of got there, for the duration of one glass of wine.

 > **RIKER**: The Neutral Zone, sir. We're heading up the new task force. Apparently, the Romulans are interested in talking.

Sorry, but in what world does it make *any* sense to send Riker in for negotiations?  Every time that we have seen him without Picard keeping him on a short leash, he has shown up to kill hundreds of people.  He killed a defenseless officer a few scenes before this, even...

 > **PICARD**: Well I can't think of a better man for the job. If I may, just a word of advice about your first command.

Picard will take a break from his existential grief to crack more jokes about how he should have beamed down to planets more often.

 > **PICARD**: I don't know if all this has made any sense. I wanted you to know what kind of man he was. In his quest to be more like us, he helped us to see what it means to be human.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: No, he wasn't. But his wonder, his curiosity about every facet of human nature allowed all of us to see the best parts of ourselves. He evolved. He embraced change because he always wanted to be better than he was.

We all see the overt racism, here, right?  I didn't imagine it?  Data had a "quest to be more like [humans]" because "he always wanted to be better than he was."  And, in this context, B-4 (and everybody different?) should learn from that example.

 > **B-4**: {% emoji musical notes %} Never saw the sun...Never saw the sun...Never saw the sun... {% emoji musical notes %}

Well, he knows a public domain song[^ec7Xzu], so that means that they can stop feeling sad about Data's death.

[^ec7Xzu]:  OK, in 2002, the copyrights still held firm.  As I have written about in other posts, around the turn of the century, it [looked like more copyrights would never expire]({% post_url 2025-10-26-define-free-culture-history %}) in the United States, because Congress had extended all copyright terms by twenty years.  In fact, it would take almost twenty years from the film's release, for the copyright on *Blue Skies* to expire, an event that I called out a little over four years ago in my [New Year 2023]({% post_url 2023-01-01-hny2023 %}) post, though I didn't know that it had anything to do with this film or that I'd end up watching it.

## Quick Commentary

I...

{% emoji person facepalming %}

How did each of these films get worse?  And they didn't exactly start with brilliance.  Actually, scratch that, because I already know how it happened:  They somehow decided that *Star Trek* needed to become an action film franchise, with muscled men wrasslin', and that doesn't really work when you have a sixty-year-old who looks pained whenever he moves as your top candidate for your protagonist and everybody else trying to live out a family sitcom.

Admittedly, if I ignore the (ahem) "fun" bits---the kind of humor that I imagine only lands if your identity revolves around a deep investment in these specific characters---this one at least started out with some promise, at least having the virtue of not taking every single plot point from the first six films, except at the end.  But between the "look at all the testosterone" action scenes, the goofy side-bits that barely make any sense, wasting *so much time* on Data's antics (while continuing to use Troi, Crusher, and La Forge as little more the props) so that they could kill him so that they could set up his identical replacement as if they'd ever get another sequel out of this, the racism against Worf, and Shinzon's completely nonsensical plot, and it almost makes me miss the Nexus replacing Picard's dead nephew.

And did Picard's fictional childhood disease have some point?  I expected a [Chekhov's gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun) kind of situation, where they'd need to use it against Shinzon, or Picard would need to face his past, or *something*.  Instead, it only seems to serve as a reminder of Picard's privilege, that his family could remove his disability without it ever affecting his life.  And also a reminder that somebody needs to smack him every time he talks about wishing that he could live in the 1800s...

Also, especially with the ending of Riker (of all people) sent to negotiate with the Romulans, and how the main plot mostly comes down to adolescent sibling rivalry, it almost makes me wonder how this plot plays out if Picard didn't spend the first act or so slapping Shinzon's extended hand away.  The story has time for Picard's stand-up routine at the wedding and Data playing exasperated parent, but never to even consider the possibility that Shinzon might actually want peace or a connection to his biological family beyond the literal need for Picard's blood, a plot point that lasts for about ten minutes before Shinzon decides that he doesn't care anymore.

I have mentioned a couple of times that I have often seen **Enterprise** as probably pushing the franchise beyond its means, functionally ending it until the full reimagining in 2009, but it looks a lot like these films did a lot more of the work on that front.  If I had kept up with the franchise this far out, I certainly wouldn't have had any interest in a fifth film of this run.

## Conclusions

Somewhat predictably, we get less out of the hind end of the film, but still...

### The Good

They finally, if briefly, express some grief.

### The Bad

In Data, we still see a disinterest in respecting the time of colleagues, preferring to talk about irrelevant excuses than solving the immediate and pressing problem.  Similarly, we see nothing more important in the galaxy than massaging the boss's ego.

Apparently, the entire Federation serves as a minor adjunct to Earth.  Without Earth, they suggest, the rest of the Federation has no chance of survival.

And even as he denies it, Picard talks a lot about his desire for violence, both hinting that he has plans for destroying Earth, and how he sees himself as a battlefield commander.  And Riker gets to murder someone.

We add to the racism and sexism the idea that they should ignore people who don't strive to grow in ways that Federation elitists endorse.  We also return to racism, though, in suggesting that aspiring to humanity makes people better.

Starfleet apparently can't do better than Riker for leading their task force to normalize relations with the Romulans.

### The Weird

Picard continues his "will he or won't he" flirtation with Christianity.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when...look, I should move on to the summaries for the sake of my health, but I as long as I need to reevaluate all my life choices watching these films, I might as well stew for a couple more weeks.  As such, I'll make everybody regret their life choices by filling in the blanks of [*The Pegasus*]({% post_url 2025-08-14-pegasus %}) and go through the relevant scenes of *These Are the Voyages...*.

Meanwhile, I probably shouldn't promise anything, because I might not have anything useful to say, but I have located an archived copy of the annotated **Nemesis** script, and so feel sorely tempted to do a members-only rundown of what I can get out of it, beyond (I assume) inappropriate jokes that don't feel particularly funny.  If that sounds like your kind of thing, then you can [join up](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) on Buy Me a Coffee.
