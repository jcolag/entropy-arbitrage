This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads a couple of short stories by the same author.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *Solar Spirits*, *Emergent Requests*, and *Self Image*
 * Location:  <https://www.dscript.org/>
 * Released:  2024
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  [Matthew DeBlock](https://www.dscript.org/)
 * Medium:  Short Stories
 * Length:  Approximately ten thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Instances of classist and ableist terminology (*Self Image*)

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Assorted Short Stories

Unfortunately, I don't have much of a useful description, here.  The author describes himself as follows.

 > My name is Matthew DeBlock. I'm a Canadian technologist fluent in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese. My primary field of artistic passion is 2D representations of data and language, and recently really got into writing short stories. I aim to mix art and sci/tech in new ways. I am a firm believer in the scientific method and hope to help lessen the perceived divide between science and art. 

The website has two small comments about the project, first a broad overview of the website itself.

 > A collision of Science & Art
 >
 > Everything here is Free to copy, edit, use, and sell by anyone for anything
 >
 > An organization of Art, Ideas, and Fun...
 >
 > Not an organization of people
 >
 > Don't need to be a company to buy .com
 >
 > Don't need to be an organization to buy .org
 >
 > But yes... I wanted .com however it was not available

And this seems specific to the stories.

 > I have nothing against AI written or AI assisted story writing, but mine are drafted and revised using pen and paper with without AI, then typed and published.  I just can't stop using pen/brush and paper, I love it too much No AI writing, editing, or revision at all (unless you count spellcheck, which is an AI enhanced tool nowadays).

I've known that the author exists for a while, now, due to the earlier art projects hosted on the same site, DScript itself going back a *long* way, at least 2012.  And I spotted that he recently started adding the stories, so decided to check them out.

Note that the section for the stories identifies them as "not public domain," which accurately reflects the license notice at the bottom that the author has made everything on the website available under the CC BY 4.0 license...but the phrasing suggests that maybe he had a different intent at some point.

## What Works Well?

The stories definitely have some good ideas that I haven't necessarily seen before.

I'd also call out *Self Image* as having a fairly good arc, the only one of the three stories that feels like an actual story.  Even though it comes in the form of a lab notebook, we have borderline-suspenseful moments, and the character changes gradually throughout.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Instead of a superficial discussion of a fictional scientific paper by people who only have initials instead of names, in *Solar Spirits*, I feel like it would work far better presented as the fictional scientific paper.  Instead, we get insipid, leading questions, followed by a summary of the relevant part of the paper, and if a story wants to do that much exposition and that little plot, it might as well commit to the bit.

The structure of these stories also feels awkward, structured almost like a stage play with ever line preceded by the speaker's name, but with the line in quotes.  But occasional narrative bits also show up with a seeming disinterest in grammar.  And the shorter stories don't seem to have plots, only concepts that characters talk about.

## Opportunities

I don't see any community, but the author does say the following.

 > YES...
 >
 > I would love to collaborate, and I am interested in any ideas, projects, positions, participations, etc. I can be contacted at [image of the e-mail address]

That mostly sounds like design work for other projects, though I don't know that for sure.

## What's Adaptable?

Nothing and nobody has a name, but each story has a signature idea, the solar energy creatures, the emerging AI, and the imaging machine.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll listen to fiff dimension's **acoustic (yin)**.  Because it has an appropriately named counterpart, and I don't think that we've gotten to see multipart albums, we'll follow it with **electric (yang)**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game's world so far?
