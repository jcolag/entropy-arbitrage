Today marks the [International Nurses Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nurses_Day), based on [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale)'s birthday.  In the United States, we have started transitioning health care to vitamin supplements and bear carcasses, so treat your nurses extra-nicely...

Anyway, let's check out the week's projects.

## Codidact

I got frustrated enough on my own to ask a programming question:  [Extracting Firefox Local Data](https://software.codidact.com/posts/293929), where I'd *like* to pull data from the browser's per-site databases.  It *might* have something to do with the next section...

Anyway, I got enough of an answer to let me solve the problem---it uses [snappy](https://google.github.io/snappy/) compression, for reasons that I'll probably never understand---but more on that in future weeks.

## Stenotype Corner

For my second week of actively trying to learn this, I now consistently make it through the first [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) lesson, usually reaching a twenty to twenty-four words per minute with accuracy jumping above and below ninety-one percent with occasional outliers, usually high except for a couple of days when I felt ill.  I don't know if a fifteen percent speed increase and error decrease represents a *significant* improvement, but the numbers have gone up a hair without putting in more than fifteen minutes per day, and I haven't really taken on a project like this in a couple of decades.

While the game recommends moving on after hitting 90% accuracy, it seems more useful to me to keep going until I can do so *consistently*, including with the words randomized so that I build confidence that I have the words/phonetics down, rather than only the sequence.

By the way, it occurs to me that I probably should have built my own system for drilling on the single-key words.  They equivalent of the "home row" keys, on their own, allow a person to type  is, it, about, had, can, with, are, of, a period, 'll, the, are (again), be, -ing, -es, a, to, he, and you.  While not *quite* enough to form sentences, I have to imagine that going through those repeatedly would accustom a person to the phonetic approach---especially where the phonemes sit---and quickly start combining with the other words.  For example, "he can stop the sobbing rat with a step..." makes little to no sense, *but* I managed to construct and (slowly) type it, including the ellipses, using the single keys and words from the introductory lesson.

## Mystic T-Square

The game should mostly work, at this point.  Of the most importance, here, you can now set the AI to take over for the tile-moving player.  It doesn't play *well*, but if a (human) player somehow still finds it too difficult an adversary, they can set the look-ahead to fewer moves in the future, to hobble its ability to plan.  The various variables should also have sensible defaults.

You'll also see stylistic changes, though.  The pop-ups should now look right when opened, for example, and---less style in the web sense than in general---replacing the red-X {% emoji cross mark %} emoji with a {% emoji compass %} compass, since incorrect answers get a "decline" {% emoji person gesturing no %} emoji which looks too related.  And while the styles need work, the *About* pop-up should have clearer explanations.

## Next

We've hit the home-stretch for **Mystic T-Square**.  Once I've cleared up the remaining issues, the time has finally come to refactor the blog's SASS code.  Because of a change that newsletter readers already know about, I also have changes to make for the newsletter's code.  And maybe I'll start a new project, another game, since I learned a few things bringing **Mystic T-Square** up to date, though if I actually have that kind of time, I should follow up with the Firefox local storage compression thing, instead.
