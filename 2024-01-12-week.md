As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The study suggests that exposure to flooding can cause respiratory and related allergic health effects due to dampness or mold. Also, the impact of flooding disasters on mental stress appears to be more pronounced in younger people.

While this probably doesn't seem surprising, it does require that we rethink how we look at flooding in the future.

 > Finally, many young workers are reluctant to speak up if they have concerns, or to ask questions if they donâ€™t know what to do, because they donâ€™t want to lose respect from their boss or supervisor. To avoid appearing unqualified, they may not want to admit that they need help.

I had the fortune of, with except for one brief and unpleasant stint cleaning a local office---where, indeed, I got essentially no guidance beyond the owner's preferred fullness for garbage bags---getting mostly clerical work for my early jobs, so this didn't affect me personally.  But it certainly rings true and echoes what I've seen over the years.

I don't see this ending well, but I have known enough amazing Pakistani folks to hold out hope that enough people will see the problem and fix it.

 > In all cases, the use of the drug with COVID-19 patients increased the rate of deaths. Overall, patients who were administered hydroxychloroquine were 11% more likely to die than those who were not.

Sadly, the people who actually need to understand this have convinced themselves that people who died must have had other problems, and will happily point to their dewormed friends who survived at least a few months of the pandemic.

It frequently amazes me how often a study comes along that tells us that, contrary to the awful expectations built up in each of us by society, people generally like us and enjoy having conversations with us.  I wish that I had a better handle on how to fix those expectations, because they serve to separate us, when we could bond over exactly these sorts of issues.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Les McCann, Innovative Jazz Musician, Singer Dies at 88](https://www.voanews.com/a/les-mccann-innovative-jazz-musician-singer-dies-at-88-/7421060.html) from Voice of America

 > He was best known for "Compared to What," a funky protest song on which he first teamed up with his future musical partner, saxophonist Eddie Harris. Written by Eugene McDaniels and recorded live at the 1968 Montreux Jazz Festival, "Compared to What" blended jazzy riffs and McCann's gospel-style vocals. The song condemned war, greed and injustice with such couplets as "Nobody gives us rhyme or reason/Have one doubt, they call it treason."

It disappoints me to realize that I haven't heard McCann's work in many years, but rest assured that I'll start fixing that soon...
