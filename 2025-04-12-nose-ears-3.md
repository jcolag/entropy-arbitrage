This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes (at least for now) reading **Nose Ears**, from *Doing your Best* (#102) to *Non-Fungible Tokens* (#150).

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Nose Ears**
 * Location:  <https://wuzzy.neocities.org/>
 * Released:  2021 --
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  [Wuzzy](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/)
 * Medium:  Comic strip
 * Length:  Approximately one thousand strips (currently)
 * Content Advisories:  Nothing that I noticed

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Nose Ears

OK, so we need to start by pointing out that this comic derives its characters and art from Nina Paley's **Mimi and Eunice**, about who and which more later.  That out of the way, the website describes the comic as follows.

 > Nose Ears is an absurd comic about the absurd things in life. There’s not any particular topic because absurdity can be found everywhere: In the Internet, in computers, games, gender, bigotry, power structures, copyright, language, crappy ideologies, belief systems, emotions and much more.
 >
 > There’s also an official German version. A few comic strips are untranslatable, so they only exist in one language.

It also has a [long history](https://wuzzy.neocities.org/meta/long_history/) page that details the thinking that went into deciding to adapt/continue/rebut the original comic.

And that brings us to Paley.  We've "met" her before when talking about [**Sita Sings the Blues**]({% post_url 2021-11-06-sita %}), and in that post, I explained the unpleasantness surrounding any support for her.  I respect that she probably did more than anybody else---through publicizing her film---to bring people to Free Culture, *but* she got there herself to spite the estate of Annette Hanshaw for daring to enforce copyright.  Because this incident led her to oppose copyright in general, she supports paying to support companies who manufacture physical media or stream it digitally, but not artists.  Her two major films both aggressively dismiss non-Western culture.  And in trying to defend her transphobia, expressed anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, misogynist, and anti-science views, while blaming some variation of the woke mob for the backlash against her transphobic comics.

I go through all this, not because I want to "take her down" or give her *any* attention at all, but partly to warn you that supporting her work will inevitably tie you to all her issues, and maybe more importantly for this post, indicate what about **Nose Ears** caught my attention.  You see, I learned about the project when the creator posted on Mastodon---I can't find the toot---that they think of it as a Free Culture experiment, taking the good parts of work by a problematic individual like Paley, and building on it to create something that puts the concept to better use without whitewashing their problems.

In that sense, the comic exemplifies a lot of what I've always wanted to see in Free Culture.  When I [introduced this series of posts]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}), I talked about especially wanting to find properties that could grow beyond the creator's personal attention.  And every week, I talk about elements of each work that you or I can "borrow" for exactly those purposes.  This comic does both, and stands against a lousy political stance.

## What Works Well?

The comics seem to slowly become more confident, where a casual reader could plausibly believe that the characters originate here.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

While a couple of themes exist, with extended conversations on (for example) virtual reality and video game addiction, the majority of these comics feel completely unrelated, with one-off jokes that loosely reference events of the day, seemingly discarding a lot of the work built in the previous hundred comics.

In addition, quite a few of the jokes feel like a flop.  Often, but not always, it tries to satirize awful positions, but presents them as too credible and someone could read them as supporting those awful positions.  Or as mentioned, we have a significant run of comics talking semi-seriously about [video game addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_addiction), which seems wildly out of step with the rest of the comics for a variety of reasons.

## What's Adaptable?

We get the popular television series **Lady of the Amulets** and proprietary MimichatⓇ.

## Coming Attractions

We'll put **Nose Ears** aside for the moment, because we have another nine hundred or so comics remaining; we may return to it when we inevitably start revisiting creators.  As such, next time, we'll read **Echoes in the Static: The Ghost Town of Wavelength**, a short role-playing game paying tribute to the works of David Lynch.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the comic so far?
