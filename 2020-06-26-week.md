As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1275051914195918857) [What if the federal deficit didn't actually matter? Modern Monetary Theory explained](https://www.fastcompany.com/90515098/what-if-the-federal-deficit-didnt-actually-matter-modern-monetary-theory-explained) from Fast Company

 > ...argues that there are some constraints that should curb government spending, the unfounded fear of a deficit---that the government should be run like a business---should not be one.

The "run government like a business" mantra had already exposed its lack of grounding in its refusal to run government like a *thriving* business that invests in improving itself.  However, the reaction to the pandemic has also made it clear that all those changes that society "can't afford" are, in fact, fairly straightforward, when the people demand it.

As much as certain people want to insist that scientists keep "changing the story," nothing has changed.  If you're close enough to smell someone, you're close enough to breathe what they're exhaling (and they you), so either stay out of people's way or wear a mask.  If you're concerned about people needing to see your face---if you deal with people who are hard of hearing or you don't enunciate well---use a plastic face shield.  That's it.

 > ...the foundation of his fight was a decision that he agreed more with the ideals of the Confederacy, than he did with those of the Union.

There's are two easy ways to tell whether Confederate statues are to celebrate history or instruments to intimidate minorities.  First and most obviously, there's balance.  There were many more slave revolts than Civil War battles, so if you don't have more statues of the likes of Nat Turner, Josiah Henson, and Madison Washington than Robert E. Lee, it's certainly not for history.  Second, if the statue in question was erected after the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, it's there to tell Black people that they're not welcome.  See?  Easy.

Also, nobody takes their class down to the old statue for an education.  Any teacher who did so would be fired.

 > "Ten times, right, ten times," Trump said, referring to the number of flushes it takes to discharge the load in an "environmentally friendly" toilet. "Not me, of course not me. But you."

Is it petty to bring this up?  Yes.  Is it petty for the President of the United States to argue with the EPA, because he wants to insist that somebody else's load (not *his*, of course; a friend, I guess, with whom he has these sorts of conversations...) is the biggest and most beautiful that his friend can't flush it?  Also yes.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Unicode got a proposal for a kneeling-in-protest emoji two years ago. So where is it?](https://www.fastcompany.com/90516190/unicode-got-a-proposal-for-a-kneeling-in-protest-emoji-two-years-ago-so-where-is-it?partner=feedburner) from Fast Company

 > While the graphic in the proposal showed the emoji on one knee, the text didn't specify that the "person kneeling" emoji should be on one knee instead of two.

[This ðŸ§Ž](https://emojipedia.org/person-kneeling/) is the character, in case you want to look at it on the different platforms.  Google is, indeed, the only group I can find that got the message, and the rest almost look silly and contrived, in comparison.  Even in the assumption, the artists seem to have not been able to figure out how to create a pose that would cover the subtle differences between different kinds of kneeling and instead created an unsatisfying geometric average.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Here's What Juneteenth Looked Like in New York City](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5pyw7/heres-what-juneteenth-looked-like-in-new-york-city) from VICE

 > Of the 484 people arraigned on what the office called "protest and 'looting' related cases" between May 28 and June 4, 343---or 71%---were Black. Another 99 people were "Black-Hispanic" or "White-Hispanic," according to the office.

Of *course* that's what happened on a day celebrating the freedom of the final emancipation in the United States.  Obviously...
