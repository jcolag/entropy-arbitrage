{:toc}

I wrote some more short epistolary fiction for the modern age, though I admittedly started it a while back, as you might note from any remaining small context clues.  You'll find (lengthy) explanations at the end of the post.

Please note that you will not actually have the ability to watch any shows that we quietly deleted from our servers and erased all evidence of ever existing for tax purposes.  But we did say "favorites," and you can't call it a favorite, if it never existed.  Abe Lincoln said that, we think.  Or maybe Sparky, Barney Google's horse.

Remember, you can sign up any time during the next three months.

So what if that tier of service overlaps the original audio with recordings of Teddy Roosevelt's stomach growling and displays sideways?

We found some scientific papers saying that you should spend your money on experiences---maybe watching Comet Films{% emoji trademark %}?---rather than things, like the thing-like streaming packages that some of those *other* streaming services offer.  They even use the term *package*, so you do the math.

And as people say, the best experiences are watching movies about police officers tired of respecting civil liberties and ex-Confederate soldiers overcoming adversity to rebuild their lives.  Which people?  Hush.  People-people, OK?

It's just that, you know, Comet Zenith{% emoji trademark %} has some really great shows and movies that nobody watches, not even the great AI-generated shows that cost us no money to produce and have no creativity to them, and we know that Max Amazing can't be as satisfying as we---I mean *our shows*---were.

OK, look.  We know that something went wrong.  Maybe it has to do with canceling a bunch of critically acclaimed shows that people cared about even though we refused to advertise them or tell fans how to support them.  Or maybe it has to do with scrapping fan-favorite projects after completion, because our accountants said that we could save a few dollars on our taxes.  Nobody likes taxes, right?  Maybe you don't want to watch new content exclusively generated by AI based on slop that we scraped from the Internet without permission.  Or maybe you think that our prices have gone too high for the value that we offer, when you could buy most of what you watch on physical media *twice* for what you pay us in a year.  Maybe you even don't like that we've had our video playback mining cryptocurrency, and will only show you the latest episodes of our most popular shows on time if you buy NFTs.  You might think that legs belong in virtual reality offerings, or think that virtual reality, cryptocurrencies, and AI all waste absurd amounts of energy to no useful end.

The completists might want to go back and click the buttons.  Mostly, I only left messages explaining why you shouldn't click them, but occasionally dropped in some information on my choices that didn't belong in the following.

### Background

This piece started with inspiration from the almost creatively terrible e-mails that Netflix once sent when you disable your account.  I don't know if they've improved them or still send out this slop, but at the time, I recommended canceling the service specifically to see them to everybody I knew, due to their complete ineptness.

If *I* ran that project, I would primarily have the software look at the user's watch-list, and generate e-mails to the effect of, "hey, weren't you waiting for the new season of **The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy**?  Well, guess what just dropped! {% emoji fireworks %}"  That feels like a rich space, because it shouldn't take much effort to also say "since you gave a thumbs-up {% emoji thumbs up %} to **The Beetle**, you'll probably want to know that Yi (Marjorie Lindon) Deng stars as **Silas Marner**'s Molly Farren, available to watch on Thursday."

I use public domain novels, here, so that the examples don't get bogged down by specifics, but the idea matters more than the shows.  They know what their customers watch.  They can make reasonable guesses that other shows and movies with similar features would perform well with those people.  We know that they can do this, because they use that as a selling point *while you subscribe*.

Instead, though, they sent insipid, generic messages that have subject lines like "Miss Us, Yet?" or "Happy Tuesday, John!  Time to Come Back to Netflix," and include some small number pictures of movies and shows that I would almost certainly never watch, based on my watch history.

Once, they came *close* to getting it right.  They looked at my history, and generated an e-mail asking if I remembered watching **Ma Rainey's Black Bottom**---literally the last thing I watched there, in fact, while I waited for my subscription to end---and whether I want to sign back up to watch it *again*.  For the record, the (not Free Culture) film worked as well as you might expect, given the (also not Free Culture) play's excellent pedigree, but I don't think that I have ever watched anything on Netflix, then watched it again, so it feels like an absurd tactic from the people with data to know better.  But at least they tried to act like my preferences comprised a relevant part of the choice to renew, with that one.  The rest of the e-mails came off as hilariously bad.

Therefore, I decided to take that mess as a starting point and see how bad it could get, including the old spam problem of the people writing the mail-merge programs breaking their merge process and leaving incorrect variables (such as `%FNAME`) littering their work, getting excited about every useless technology trend, and the weird endgame of sending multiple messages in succession to warn about impending deadlines.  I hope that the drone writing these eventually figured out which variable actually works in their system...

I have to admit, though, that some e-mails have more truth to them than they probably should.  For example, they actually did send me an unhinged e-mail citing [the study about spending money on experiences](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2020/03/spending-on-experiences-rather-than-things-is-associated-with-greater-immediate-happiness-study-finds/), though they didn't try to imply that other streaming services wouldn't count.

### Names and the Calendar

For the record, the Comet Film Company comes from Laura Lee Hope's *Moving Pictures Girls* book series---originally published from 1914 to 1916 in the United States---where location shoots routinely go horribly wrong, stranding the cast and crew of that book's film in some abandoned and/or dangerous part of the world.  Riffing on that as if they had since grown to become a major studio, I threw together Comet Zenith---"zenith" as the astronomical term for the point directly above you, used as a thematically appropriate nod to the "pluses" and "maxes" that pervade the space---as the streaming service backed by Comet's parent conglomerate.  To be fair, though, I also picked the name because we have both a comet emoji {% emoji comet %} *and* a comet/meteor Font Awesome glyph <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i> to use in the subject lines.  Max Amazing, both the streaming service and its implied founder, makes its first and (one imagines) final "appearance" here, and you can *probably* guess what company and founder I had in mind for that, based either on the name itself or the uncomfortable rocketry fetish.  I then used the [Common calendar](https://github.com/jcolag/CommonCalendar/)'s days of the week[^3] with the [Pataphysical calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Pataphysics#Pataphysical_calendar), thirteen months of twenty-nine[^2] days each, month names translated loosely to Esperanto, setting everything later this year, though only because I liked those month names...

[^2]:  With occasional exceptions---one annual, one in Leap Year---the twenty-ninth day doesn't exist.  The fourteenth of Sand does mark the day of *Don Quichote, champion du monde*, though.

[^3]:  Note that this wrecks one of the nice things about the Pataphysical calendar and other thirteen-month calendars, that every month runs for exactly four seven-day weeks, and each month starts on the same day of the week.  Months that run for twenty-eight days don't divide by weeks of six days.  But I didn't want to saddle this with recognizable names for the days of the week.

For the shows and movies, I imagine **Austen Pride** as a teen drama, probably set in an Austin, Texas, high school, based on the works of Jane Austen in a different context, like **The Gods of Pegāna** probably serves as an anthology series based on [the Lord Dunsany series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_of_Peg%C4%81na), **The Philo Vance Mysteries** presumably bases its story or stories on the character from [**The Benson Murder Case**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Benson_Murder_Case), [**The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman) presumably attempts to present a meta-textual comedy loosely based on the novel---all in the public domain---and **The League of the Silver Bat** presumably comes out of the world of [my own novel]({% post_url 2019-12-14-seeking-refuge %}), licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.  [**Bobble the Clown Shark**](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-993) or SCP-993 describes a (fictional) animated television series from 1949, [**Karma Kameleon’s Adventures on Earth!**](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4228) or SCP 4228 describes another (fictional) animated children's series, and [**Penumbra W.A.V.E.**](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3949) or SCP-3949 describes a (fictional) 1980s anime-inspired animated series, descriptions licensed CC BY-SA 3.0.  I mean **La Bohème** to refer to [the 1926 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boh%C3%A8me_%281926_film%29) based on the opera or a modern production of the opera, now in the public domain.  [**Caminandes**](http://www.caminandes.com/) actually exists as a Blender Foundation-produced short animated series, licensed CC BY 3.0.  **Can a Monkey Do My Job?**, **Jello-sy**, and **Zombie Chris** originated as concepts in the now-defunct [**Fictopedia**](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/) community, licensed CC BY 3.0.  **Continuity Drift** presumably runs a television series based on the comic covered for the [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2021-01-30-drift %}) (by pseudo, CC BY); likewise with **Dustrunners** and [the novel]({% post_url 2021-08-07-typhoon1 %}) (by MCM, CC0), **Floraverse Theater** and [the *Floraverse* comic]({% post_url 2020-05-23-seeds %}) (by Glitched Puppet, CC BY-SA 4.0), **The New Adventures of Lightbringer** based on [the comic]({% post_url 2021-10-09-lightbringer %}) (by Lewis Lovhaug, public domain), [**Pepper & Carrot**]({% post_url 2020-12-19-pepper %}) based on the comic (by David Revoy, CC BY), **The Rõivas Chronicles** based on [**Headshot**]({% post_url 2021-07-17-headshot %}) (by Julien Boyen, CC BY-SA), **Soulclaine:  Soulmates** a kind of modern romantic comedy version of [**Solitudes and Silence**]({% post_url 2021-06-19-solitudes1 %}) (by Conrad Baines Talbot, CC BY-SA), **Stardrifter** based on [the audio series]({% post_url 2020-06-13-motherload %}) (by David Collins-Rivera, CC BY-SA), **Valkaama:  The Next Generation** based on [**Valkaama**]({% post_url 2021-03-27-valkaama %}) (by Tim Baumann, CC BY-SA).  **Cosmos Laundromat** comes directly from the Blender Foundation's [Project Gooseberry](https://gooseberry.blender.org/) licensed CC BY 3.0; **Elephants Dream** comes from the *first* Blender open movie project, discussed for the [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-06-20-dream %}), also licensed CC BY 3.0.  [**BBS:  The Documentary**](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/) does pretty much what it sounds like, licensed CC BY-SA 2.0.  [**Little Robinson Crusoe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Robinson_Crusoe) came out as a 1924 comedy film, now in the public domain.  [**The Night of the Living Dead**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead), you probably already know as the 1968 zombie horror film, published without a valid copyright, and so in the public domain.  We covered [**Orang-U**]({% post_url 2020-05-09-orangu %}) for the Free Culture Book Club, by Matt Lee and Ryan Dougherty, licensed CC BY-SA.  [**The Plastic Age**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plastic_Age_%28film%29) came out as a famous 1925 Clara Bow film, now in the public domain.  **Watch out, Bobby Make-Believe, the Gevkahahal Is behind You!** imagines a series based on the 1915 comic strip [**Bobby Make Believe**](https://www.barnaclepress.com/comic/Bobby%20Make-Believe/) with a Halloween special featuring [the Gevkahahal]({% post_url 2021-10-31-gevkahahal %}), something that I created loosely patterned after an SCP story.  **Justifiers:  CSI** comes from [**Bulletproof Blues**]({% post_url 2022-09-24-bulletproof-1 %}) by Brandon Blackmoor and Sean Weir et al., licensed CC BY-SA.  [**Space Rover**]({% post_url 2024-01-13-space-rover-1 %}) is by Malcolm Wilson Multimedia, licensed CC BY-SA.  I chose some of these to stand in for conventional Hollywood projects that you might recognize, but knowing which probably won't affect anybody's opinion of the story.

For the side-references early on, [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln) has a reputation for having [said clever things](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln), and almost an entire cottage industry has appeared since his death attributing random quotes to him, in modern times characterized as a part of general misinformation on the Internet.  Barney Google provided comic relief in the sports pages of newspapers starting in 1919, starring in a comic called **Take Barney Google, for Instance**, known since 1934 as [**Barney Google and Snuffy Smith**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Google_and_Snuffy_Smith), a comic with somewhat broader appeal that continues through today.  In 1922, still firmly entrenched in sports, Barney---a short wealthy man in a top-hat and tails---bought a useless but endearing (non-talking) racehorse named Spark Plug, nicknamed Sparky, which appears to have kicked off the tradition of using that nickname.  [Teddy Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) similarly had a reputation for witty comments, but more importantly, we have recordings of him, if probably *not* his stomach.  And the 17 Bambuo message paraphrases an assortment of tropes and clichés from and quick references to modern romantic comedies, unfortunately relying on Fair Use rather than Free Culture licenses, but the need to have readers actually *get the joke* seriously constrained my options...

### Money

Comet Zenith marks prices in [spesmiloj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spesmilo), as much because it didn't see much use after its attempted introduction in 1907---and therefore won't offend anybody by using their currency---as because Unicode includes its distinctive symbol, `U+20B7` or <span class="emoji" title="spesmilo symbol">₷</span>, unrelated to my choosing Esperanto month names.  Using the currency also nicely dodges the need for the number to feel realistic and/or tie the story to a particular era when the prices might match, and it also helps me avoid identifying any specific part of the world.  When you read the story, it guides the implied value of 23₷ based on the current prices of artificially hobbled (ad-supported, probably standard-definition, maybe limited in the number of devices permitted to stream) services, in other words, rather than 23₷ telling you that I started writing this in a particular year when that equated to the price of artificially hobbled services.

Earlier drafts used entirely fictional currencies, then changed to cryptocurrencies---technically open source, I suppose---to take advantage of Font Awesome's icons even though I didn't like the prospect of appearing to support those ecosystems, before discovering the more "native" solution.  In retrospect, I could've probably gotten away with the old Dutch *rigsdaler* (₻ `U+20BB`), the old French *livre tournois* (₶ `U+20B6`), and a bunch of others that saw use recently enough that readers may have used those currencies, even though those would all imply a geography and (maybe) political regime.  I also could plausibly have stopped my evolutionary process at cryptocurrencies and had the story appear to endorse bitcoin (₿ `U+20BF`) or ether (Ξ `U+039E` or Greek capital Xi), but as mentioned, I never loved that idea.  If you need to do something similar, though, Wikipedia's article on currency symbols has a [section on historical currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_symbol#List_of_historical_currency_symbols).  And let's not forget the *placeholder* currency symbol rattling around since ASCII code-pages (¤ `U+00A4`), which I probably would have used (and probably did use) years back, given that ASCII didn't leave us with many options.

I also could've gone in an entirely different direction, by arbitrarily picking a symbol out of Unicode and deciding that it belongs to some new currency.  I mean, if ether can use Ξ, then surely nobody would begrudge me appropriating the Old English letter *that* (Ꝥ `U+A764`) or *wynn* (Ƿ `U+01F7`), the *gha* (Ƣ `U+01A2`) from transliterating Turkish, the *cuatrillo* (Ꜭ `U+A72C`) for transliterating Mayan, Phoenician letters, Glagolitic letters, or many other possibilities[^4] that would cause far less confusion than a modern Greek letter.  But I actually do like the spesmilo, so it stays.

[^4]:  I won't bore you more than I already have, here, but Unicode has *so much* in it that probably won't ever see use outside an academic paper, making them useful when appropriating somebody's culture feels inappropriate.  Although, take some care in "gray areas," such as [ghost characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_characters) that probably won't see real use elsewhere, but using them as pseudo-Japanese text would probably feel like the same sort of garbage Japanese misappropriation that we see throughout Western Culture.

### Domain Names

Oh, and the e-mails come from `cometzenith.corp`, because ICANN decided to [no longer process applications for `.corp`, `.home`, and `.mail` top-level domains](https://www.icann.org/en/board-activities-and-meetings/materials/approved-board-resolutions-regular-meeting-of-the-icann-board-04-02-2018-en#2.c) in 2018, due to their widespread use in private networks.  Or put into plainer language, you'll probably never see a legitimate URL with those three suffixes, meaning that nobody can "squat" on the Comet Zenith URL for nefarious purposes[^1].  Likewise, our absent protagonist has an e-mail address at `xybercorp.mail` for the same reason, Xybercorp itself coming courtesy of [*The Spiraling Web*]({% post_url 2021-02-27-spiraling1 %}) by Ryan Somma, licensed CC BY-SA.

[^1]: OK, yes, you *can* find outfits that will sell you domains with certain forbidden or otherwise unused TLDs, such as [Alter NIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlterNIC)'s various successors.  But to access a site with that domain, you would need to supplement your DNS resolution with something that the vendor controls, which the overwhelming majority of people won't do without a compelling reason.  And even if they do, I don't believe that any current alternate DNS roots offer those three TLDs, for the same reasons that ICANN declined to do so:  Registering them means that your domain name might get hidden by many home and corporate networks, making the names unreliable.

Whew!  I now hope that somebody runs with something in this story, because I needed to spend a couple-thousand of words on *explanations*, and we haven't even gotten to the image credits.  Speaking of which...
