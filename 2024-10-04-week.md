As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

This past Supreme Court run had a lot of awfulness in it, but this definitely felt like the most destructive, and I wonder how much the others---like the presidential immunity decision---only exist to camouflage the idea that the judiciary appointed itself as overseers of the executive branch.

 > As one of the only industrialized countries in the world without national paid leave, the United States forces moms in particular to choose between continuing to work or raising our children.

And this would go without saying, except that we have a political movement in the country that believes that we need to use poverty as an incentive to constantly work.

For some reason, this didn't post despite seeing it in the schedule beforehand, so enjoy an extra "bonus" article that *should* have gone out.

 > The minimum program must be workable, something that we can all agree on, an articulation of what is the problem, how do we solve it, which forces can we solve them with, which forces are going to be against this program, and who are our friends and who are our enemies...the most difficult thing in this world is not even unseating a tyrant; it‚Äôs to bring movements together to agree on a common purpose.

This actually worries me a lot about the current anti-Trump coalition.  We have people praising and amplifying Republicans who hate Trump, even when they turn around and support effectively the same policies.  And while that'll make it through the election, assuming that it succeeds, we've conditioned people to go back to thinking that "we should close our borders and slash welfare" sound like legitimate positions again.

It's make the world so much better if we could use the World Bank as a force for progress, instead of a force for privatizing infrastructure...

I didn't expect Sun Ra to feature prominently in the conversation, but it makes me glad to see.  If you haven't listened to his music, do yourself a favor and fix that.  I don't remember who introduced me to it back in my school days, but I owe that person my thanks...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://knowablemagazine.org/docserver/fulltext/hummingbirds-1600x600.jpg|A colorful hummingbird hovers at a flower, feeding with a long beak|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Hummingbirds thrive on an extreme lifestyle. Here‚Äôs how](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/how-hummingbirds-adapt-to-an-extreme-lifestyle) from Knowable Magazine

 > When a bird is in danger of running out of energy, it may go torpid at night, dropping its body temperature nearly to that of the surrounding air ‚Äî sometimes just a few degrees above freezing. While in torpor, the bird appears almost comatose, unable to respond quickly to stimuli, and breathing only intermittently.

This caught my interest, and so I figured that it probably would to at least a couple of readers...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Queer African liberations, solidarity and peace](https://whoseknowledge.org/queer-african-liberations-solidarity-and-peace/) from Whose Knowledge?

 > Initiated by the FEW in 2004, Soweto Pride is described as a political project whose aim is to create and make political and social space for black lesbian women to create visibility and amplify their voices, as well as to engage with community organizations and the broader local community people in Soweto.

We need more of this, both around the world and in Wikipedia's communities.  I recently had a conversation on Cohost about how condescending it feels that every Wikipedia article about a transgender person---and *only* those articles---feels the need to explain pronouns to the reader instead of using them and assuming that we can figure it out.  As a sign that things could change, I drew a parallel with how, only around a decade ago, the encyclopedia, among [many other problems with misogyny](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/), covered fewer women and---when they covered women at all---often explicitly mentioned their gender and relationship status, whereas that rarely came up with men.  And after sustained media attention, they've started to fix that.
