As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

In the spirit of the endless parade of credulous articles complaining that "I asked ChatGPT for specific information and --- gasp! --- it made up an incorrect answer," I have decided to take things a step further:

I asked Stable Diffusion for "security footage of my front porch."

Ah-ha, though! There isn't nearly that much foliage outside my house, certainly no furniture, and I do NOT, in fact, live in an anime world.

The world must know of this injustice! üôÑ

![An AI-generated image of an enclosed deck surrounded by foliage, with two outdoor couches surrounding a low table, either flowers or food on the table; it is drawn in the style of an anime scene](/blog/assets/AAfu7T44guw8qJWGEVh4--1--4tqc4.jpg "Subsequent images didn't even show the same porch.  How can I use this to watch my porch...?")

Hashtags:  #Humor #AI #LazyJournalism

As I discussed in my [Five Phases of AI Grief]({% post_url 2023-02-26-ai-grief %}), I find it mind-boggling that people jumped from "AI makes some fun things" to "AI gave me directions to a place, even though it doesn't exist."  It feels like the logical next step to feign outrage when AI models can't produce specific real-world images.

 > According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the US Department of Justice, there were 1,186 Black adults incarcerated in state or federal facilities for every 100,000 adults in 2021, and 1,004 American Indians and Alaska Natives incarcerated for every 100,000 adults.

What a surprise, training systems on our extremely and often-deliberately racist criminal justice system results in new racist systems...

 > Parents and students need to know their rights. In the United States there are Parent Information Centers that help. Also, after years of implementation of our laws, more students with disabilities are graduating from secondary school and entering work or higher education.

Hashtags:  #DisabilityRights #RIP

I don't think that the media speaks nearly enough about the disability rights movement, especially odd considering that we all gain disabilities at some point in our lives.  For a classic example, if you need to take care of one or more children, you have effectively lost most of the use of at least one arm, can't walk as quickly, and you probably have difficulty focusing on everything around you.  But we also age, get injured, and now get sick.

Why do we still need to talk about this?  Have the journals and research institutions not had enough shame heaped on them to even *pretend* to have an even hand when working out how to help people?

Unfortunately, social justice never works like an on-off switch.  We need to *always* and simultaneously fight for more and prevent back-slides.  We certainly won't find a "silver bullet" to solve problems in one step.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://images.theconversation.com/files/512749/original/file-20230228-784-bty4l6.jpg|Women listen during the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963|false| %}

 > As the 60th anniversary of the march approaches, it is critical to recognize the activism of women from all walks of life who helped to strategize and organize one of the country‚Äôs most massive political demonstrations of the 20th century. Yet historical accounts overwhelmingly highlight the march‚Äôs male leadership.

We've had a long history of civil rights movements cleaving into specific interests instead of holding together, and it hasn't done any of us---except the people in power who would rather hold back these movements as long as possible---any good.  Highlighting that "lost" work, I hope, will help modern groups from abandoning intersectionality.
