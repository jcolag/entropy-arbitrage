As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Wait a second, are these all the same day of the week?")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Before the FACE act, protests frequently turned violent. In March 1993, David Gunn, an abortion provider and clinic director, was shot and killed by an abortion opponent outside a clinic in Pensacola, Florida, as he was walking in to work.

Hashtags:  #Abortion #USPol #FACEAct

To nobody's surprise, I imagine, the Trump administration doesn't really mind if things become more violent.  If you fear people killing you, then you won't have the patience to talk about his criminal activity.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114178614490986233)

 > ...it is generally admitted that every man has a right to be consulted in regard to his own concerns. The laws which he has to obey and the taxes he has to pay are things that do most intimately concern him, and the only way of being directly consulted in regard to them...is through the ballot. Is there any very good reason why women should not be free to be consulted in this direct manner?

 > Women oftentimes led the charge in rebellions on slave ships. They were often underestimated by their oppressors, being placed near the weaponry, as male slave traders didn‚Äôt fear resistance from women and children on board. Despite this, women chose strength above all.

 > They‚Äôve packaged this attack on Medicaid as an effort to cut ‚Äúwasteful‚Äù spending and punish the ‚Äúparasite class.‚Äù That‚Äôs how billionaire Elon Musk ‚Äî who was raised with a silver spoon in an affluent, all-white suburb in apartheid South Africa ‚Äî refers to Americans who use federal benefits.

It shows their absolute brilliance and creativity, by the way, that they keep recycling the same boring rhetoric about "parasitic" poor people that felt stale fifty years ago, even ignoring the clear incorrect parts...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114189950003804947)

 > The steps toward the emancipation of women are first intellectual, then industrial, lastly legal and political. Great strides in the first two of these stages already have been made by millions of women who do not yet perceive that it is surely carrying them towards the last. 

{% cite Ellen Battelle Dietrick %}

Hashtags:  #Quotes #WomensHistory

I should note, here, that Dietrick overlooked the stage that we've had to deal with for at least my entire life:  Social emancipation.  While we haven't completely squared away the legal issues, I feel like we've learned since the 1960s that legal equality only gets you part-way to the goal, when you have a significant minority of people who see women as interlopers, sex objects that have strayed too far from their homes.  If we don't fix that asinine perspective, then authoritarians will continue to provide cover for any misogynist who'd rather shout "DEI" (or affirmative action or whatever other term they find objectionable this week) whenever a woman shows up to work outside a strip club or elementary school.

 > Trump is not invincible. Resistance has also forced Trump to rescind his heavy-handed memo freezing federal funds, back off his original tariffs plan and settle for minor concessions during a 30-day pause.

You'll notice that corporate media has conspicuously talked around these incidents, or treated them as unrelated.  Keep talking about it until they have no other choice...

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114195597712741159)

I don't really have anything to add, here, other than I appreciate having current numbers to put to these ideas, instead of hand-waving it all.

 > Education is considered the peculiar business of women; perhaps for that very reason it is one of the worst-paid business in the world; the salaries of men who engage in it are double those of women, who do better work and more of it.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [‚ÄúWait, not like that‚Äù: Free and open access in the age of generative AI](https://www.citationneeded.news/free-and-open-access-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/) from Citation Needed

 > Anyone at an AI company who stops to think for half a second should be able to recognize they have a vampiric relationship with the commons.

Having made a lot of these points a year ago in my post about the [potential issues with anti-AI licenses]({% post_url 2024-03-03-ai-licenses %}), I agree with a lot of what White rights, here.

 > While drafting the Bill of Rights two decades prior, James Madison and his congressional colleagues could not agree [on the exact language for the First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-1/ALDE_00013537/), which guarantees the rights to free speech and a free press. Between 1791, when it was adopted, and Adams‚Äô signing of the laws in 1798, no court case had put those rights to the test and hashed out its meaning.

When the Republicans inevitably start rambling about how the Founders would have totally stomped on immigrants and critics, they---as usual---lie.

I can assume that [RFK, Jr., retreated on his opposition to microplastics](https://newrepublic.com/article/192730/rfk-jr-microplastics-crop-loss-antibiotics-brains) this week because he sides with the bacteria.
