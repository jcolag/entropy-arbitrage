## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Imaginary Friend

This episode really wants to focus on its plots, so we won't get too much out of it.

 > **CLARA**: I like to cook all kinds of stuff, like yogurt and raisin salad, chocolate chip pancakes and purple omelettes.

It offends me that, Paramount+ hasn't seen fit to give us the show about thirty-year-older Clara feeding her nonsensical slop to various ship crews.

Also, though...how did *chocolate chip pancakes* land on this menu?  I don't have the sweet tooth to enjoy them, myself, but those feel like a staple at almost any restaurant with a breakfast-specific menu.

 > **TROI**: Purple omelettes?

What, does she want *chocolate* omelettes, instead?

 > **CLARA**: Isabella says she likes you.

...Has anybody on this show liked Troi and *not* had the antagonist role for the episode?

 > **OGAWA**: We went to the holodeck and took a walk on the Champs-Élysées.

We last saw Ogawa in [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}).

 > **ISABELLA**: Hello, Clara.

You might recognize Isabella as [Shay Astar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shay_Astar), who'd go on to play August Leffler on [**3rd Rock from the Sun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Rock_from_the_Sun), among other appearances.

 > **LAFORGE**: So did we hit something or not? Shields say yes, sensors say no. This is very strange. Ensign, give me a breakdown on shield energy conversion and then run a spectral. Whoa. Where did you come from?

It vaguely interests me that La Forge seems more exasperated by Clara's sudden appearance than anything like annoyed at her presence or even worried about their "strange" situation.

 > **WORF**: This area is not designated for children. Are you lost? Where are you supposed to be?

This feels like it raises all sorts of questions about why you'd bother having rules like this for children to follow, when the computer could more easily limit where children could go on the ship.  Guinan will also have concerns about Clara showing up in Ten Forward.

 > **DATA**: I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it is clearly a bunny rabbit.

Notice the revelation, here:  Data actually "does a bit" when interacting with his colleagues, acting the part of their expectations of an android, instead of the mystified pedantry representing anything like his real personality.

 > **GUINAN**: It wasn't a she.
 >
 > **CLARA**: What was he like?

The show *really* wants to hammer binary genders for us, doesn't it...?

 > **PICARD**: Bridge to Commander Riker. Check with Mister La Forge. See if he found anything in the matter sample from the nebula.

Can he not ask La Forge himself...?

 > **ALEXANDER**: Clara, there's no such thing as invisible people. You're lying.

C'mon, in this universe?  Invisible people *must* exist, somewhere...

And if you forgot that Alexander existed again, we last saw him in [*Cost of Living*]({% post_url 2024-09-26-cost-living %})

 > **TROI**: But I can't help feeling that I'm taking something from her. Something precious. A part of her childhood she'll never have again.

I realize that I've said something like this before in other contexts, such as Troi's professionalism, but she genuinely seems like the worst possible therapist.  She wants to prevent a kid from maturing, because she finds her problem charming...

 > **SUTTER**: Captain, Clara has told me that her imaginary friend has been making threats. She claimed that others were on the way and that they had plans to kill everyone on the ship.

I don't care if that intelligence comes from a child, this seems like the sort of thing that you tell people about, no?  Either the attack might actually happen or the kid needs more serious help than she has gotten.

 > **PICARD**: Acknowledged. If it's energy that you want, we have other ways of providing it. You needn't destroy us.

Consistently, Picard only negotiates in cases when the alien nearly destroys the ship...or when the alien wears nice business-appropriate attire.

 > **PICARD**: You were taking her to places that were inappropriate, even dangerous.

Yes, we must protect children from the hazards of the ship's Applebee's and that empty hallway.  They saved Clara from [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes) gained from eating her feelings like Troi does...

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we don't see much in the episode, between the military logistics, fictional science, and the Very Special Episode about bullying.

### The Bad

They seem to consider unconventional foods an atrocity.  We also continue to see an insistence on a gender binary.

While possibly Starfleet-specific, they prefer to have and enforce rules for where children can go, rather than setting up systems to prevent them from getting into restricted areas.

Data perpetuates his personality as an affect, seemingly to watch people's reactions, and nobody has caught on.

Authoritarianism continues, as Picard directs Riker to look over the engineers' shoulders during a crisis instead of waiting for a status update.  And people seem afraid to report threats to safety, based on the status of the person providing information.

Therapy still stinks in the future.

The crew continues to maintain an aggressive footing when dealing with strange aliens, until those aliens credibly threaten to destroy the ship.  At that point, they become extremely cooperative.

## Next

Come back in a week, when the crew considers some light genocide between missions, in *I, Borg*.
