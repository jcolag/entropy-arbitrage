To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *2540*, *Admiring Odin*, *No Working Title*, *Singularity*, *The Common Plastic Fish (Plasticus capensis)*, and *The Nanoepitaxy of Susanne Marie*
 * Location:  <https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge>
 * Released:  2007
 * License:  CC BY-SA (and the GDFL)
 * Creator:  [Emesee](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Emesee), [Dave Braunschweig](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Dave_Braunschweig) (probably), [Remi](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Remi), [Michaelis Scientists](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=User:MichaelisScientists&action=edit&redlink=1), and [John Schmidt](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:JWSchmidt).
 * Medium:  Short stories
 * Length:  Approximately four thousand, five hundred words
 * Content Advisories:  Religious themes, some sexism and racism

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Wikiversity Science Fiction Challenge

As you might guess from the title of the activity this and last week, Wikiversity ran a science fiction challenge in 2007.  It describes the process as follows.

> **Science Fiction Challenge** is a learning project for exploring the nature and boundaries of science through science fiction writing. What does it mean to say that the subject of scientific study is "[nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature)" and what does it mean to talk of the "[supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural)"?

And it also provides some background.

> The "Science Fiction Challenge" originated from discussion at [Science and the nonphysical](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_and_the_nonphysical "Science and the nonphysical") where it was suggested that scientists are unlikely to discover explanations for supernatural phenomena because they assume that such things as "[nonphysical](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Nonphysical&action=edit&redlink=1) spirit" only exist in the imagination. An alternative possibility is that scientists have low levels of interest in supernatural phenomena because past experience has shown that it is hard to make scientific progress on studies of supernatural phenomena. The "Science Fiction Challenge" calls for the creation of fictional accounts of how scientific studies might some day bring seemingly supernatural phenomena within the boundary of what can be studied and understood scientifically.

The individual stories have the following blurbs.

> - [The nanoepitaxy of Susanne Marie](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/The_nanoepitaxy_of_Susanne_Marie "Science Fiction Challenge/The nanoepitaxy of Susanne Marie") - explores the idea that there might be evidence for extraterrestrial life that can be found right on Earth....if we knew where to look and what to look for. Could extra-terrestrials with advanced technology have built seemingly supernatural abilities into Earth's life forms?
> - [No Working Title](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/No_Working_Title "Science Fiction Challenge/No Working Title") - In 1948 Arthur C. Clarke published _[Against the Fall of Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Fall_of_Night "w:Against the Fall of Night")_, a story in which he imagined Earth of the far future when the residents of the city Diaspar were essentially immortal and there were few children. From our perspective in the year 2015, what kind of future can we foresee for Earth? Given technological tools for genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, will the human species last for long or will we create our own replacements? Would a new form of life created by humans have a soul?
> - [2540](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/2540 "Science Fiction Challenge/2540") - this story explores [nanorobotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics "w:Nanorobotics") as a future technology that provides an example of [Clarke's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws "w:Clarke's three laws"). If nanites were present and active on Earth, how could we distinguish their effects from magic?
> - [Singularity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/Singularity "Science Fiction Challenge/Singularity") - Magho'ple discovers that she is inside a [simulated reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality "w:Simulated reality"). Can she escape from the simulated reality and exist as an artificial life form in the real world?
> - [Admiring Odin](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/Admiring_Odin "Science Fiction Challenge/Admiring Odin") - [Ancient astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronaut_hypothesis "w:Ancient astronaut hypothesis"), Alec and Odin, are two aliens who visit Earth. Alec is a [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir "w:Fenrir") who must work with [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin "w:Odin") to genetically modify the people of Europe so as to remove the Neanderthal genes that give them telepathic powers.

That should at least give you a broad sense of the intent.

Note that we'll skip [**The Search for Kalid**](https://fiction.fandom.com/wiki/The_search_for_Kalid), partly because---as you can see by the URL---it didn't actually land on the Wikiversity site[^iQZ3xA], and partly because it runs a hundred thirty-eight thousand words, making it a project for another session, maybe.

[^iQZ3xA]:  Instead ending up on a Fandom site, the only system on the Internet that seems to *want* to look like it'll pass viruses along to your computer.

## What Works Well?

A couple of the stories---*The Nanoepitaxy of Susanne Marie*, *No Working Title* (because the author didn't decide on a title, not because we'd call the story that), and *2540*---feel like they set up enough to have some potential for an interesting story down the road.  Those stories most notably have distinct characters.

We also see some at-least-mildly clever ideas across the board where, even if I don't think that somebody could refurbish the *story* into something readable, a clever author could probably use "alien abductions, but of clones of interesting individuals, performed by octets of clones working for the extraterrestrials" or "a box accelerating times through generations (of plants)" as a springboard.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Getting the most egregious out of the way first, *Admiring Odin* feels like a mess waiting to happen.  In six hundred words, we get a sexist crack about visiting places for the women (and that the desirability of women goes down after childbirth), the premise that ancient Europeans (and only them) inherited telepathy from earlier hominids, *and* that our interventionists need to take great care, because the specific tribe of Europeans figures things out so fast that nothing more than the visual of ski-tracks through the snow will have them intuiting the possible existence and design of skis, as well as producing them in a few days.  Regardless of the intent, it feels less like a story---even the sort of boring story that mostly consists of exposition---than white nationalist talking points with the veneer of Norse[^i56VtX] and Anglo-Saxon mythology.

[^i56VtX]:  The use of Odin especially seems like a red flag, a common go-to in trying to smuggle white supremacy into culture, such as [The Pedigree and History of the Washington Family Derived from Odin...**](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/george-washington-a-descendant-of-odin/) (1879), which tried to cast George Washington as the descendant of a Scandinavian warlord.  It will presumably surprise nobody that it found an American audience during the World Wars, where people elided the inconvenient idea of this vision of Odin having West Asian ancestry to tie the United States firmly with German values, and so maybe we should avoid getting involved with that whole democracy-versus-fascism thing.

More broadly, while I did appreciate the stories mostly introducing clever ideas, many of them seem far too excited about their fictionalized science.  Some go into painstaking detail to convince us of the credibility of the idea, whereas others have characters talk it out as if the scientists wouldn't already know about it.

And as a minor quibble, many of these stories need proofreading and correction.  Granted, as text on a wiki, I could have signed up for an account---maybe my Wikipedia account even carries over, for all I know---and done the work instead of mentioning it here, and I may still do it if nobody else gets to it before me.  But I needed to prioritize getting the post out.

## Opportunities

I somehow doubt that you'll find anything, given the age and state of the stories.

## What's Adaptable?

We get surprisingly little, here.  *No Working Title* probably provides the most, including an unseen extraterrestrial species, their artificial proxies, and the global Linuz AI that has helped usher in a utopia over the past thousand years.  Other stories have characters that might interest people, but none who would probably fill a specific role in another story.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll watch **Breakfast at the Bodega**, a short film.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the stories?
