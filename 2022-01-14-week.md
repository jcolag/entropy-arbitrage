As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > Others dismissed the findings entirely. The Atlantic slammed the “doozy” of a poll as “highly questionable.”

This movement dates back even further than the author seems to realize.  When I was young, my parents' friends were constantly worried about the government having been subverted and/or some constantly impending "race war."  You can see evidence of it in the so-called [sovereign citizen movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) of tax evaders, too, which has been around for at least fifty years.  Even Ronald Reagan preached against trusting democratic institutions.

 > Cut off at the knees, reindeer herders were simply resettled in reservations, while those who rebelled were sent to the Levashovo Wasteland, now a memorial site.

I have yet to find any instance of historical colonization that ended well, and it has resulted in racism, genocide, and a paternalistic view of formerly conquered nations.  The fact that anyone still finds it acceptable isn't great.

For a while, my observation has been that most cultures like to brush the unpleasant parts of history under the carpet, even while celebrating the *symbols* of those parts of history.  While that behavior currently presents its most obvious dangers in the United States, European countries frequently seem to make claims that there's no racism in their societies, without ever wanting to raise the question of whether *non-white* citizens think the same thing.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1481628348862410759) [January 6 Showed Why D.C. Deserves Statehood](https://otherwords.org/january-6-showed-why-d-c-deserves-statehood/) from OtherWords

 > The federal government sets the District’s budget, dictates our laws, and has made a habit of ignoring our desire for statehood.

I may write up a full blog post for it, but I'm increasingly of the opinion that every state-sized territory administered by the United States should be represented in Congress as a state.  I once ran the numbers and, if you were to include everyplace that the United States has occupied or included as a territory, broken down to a state-equivalent level, we'd have 139 states to represent.  If we include Native American tribes---dependent sovereign nations, as they're called by the government---that would be another 597, for a total of 736 states.

Granted, not all of those territories are *still* part of the United States, but it seems overwhelming to even briefly consider the directions that the United States might have taken, if every time we invaded or otherwise took control of a territory, we needed to treat its citizens as our citizens and give them votes in the House of Representatives and Senate.

To be honest, while the research is fairly important, and I'm glad to know Kiesling's name, this article is poorly written to an almost absurd extent, trying to find some mystical reason for an on-screen indicator.  To give an indication of how sloppy it is, the *term* "cursor" goes back at least as far as slide rules and scientific instruments, where it was used to name---you guessed it---an indicator of position.  In Latin, *cursor* translates to "runner."

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Syrians turn war missiles into heaters as winter grips](https://www.scidev.net/global/syrians-turn-war-missiles-into-heaters-as-winter-grips/) from SciDev.Net

 > They are also cost-effective, he says, at only $US15, compared to around $US100 for a new heater.

The article does a great job of outlining the immediate dangers involved in this process, though it's also clearly a problem that missiles have been deployed in such bulk that they're the cheapest "raw material" available.
