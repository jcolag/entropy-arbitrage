As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...Black police officers were disciplined at an even higher rate---132% more often than white officers.

Yep.  There are bad police officers who aren't White, of course, but the big difference is that the police departments take *their* offenses more than twice as seriously.

Yep.  Some company thinks that it copyrighted grape seeds.  I wish that I could say that it's surprising.

 > in the same breath where he claims each and every person complaining about her initial uncritical response is a "pro-Biden journalist."

I wanted to make sure to post this because, while I post a lot of Intercept articles, when they're useful, Greenwald---one of the founders---is one of the many "well, I don't like the fascist, but all the people opposing the fascists are worse, because of these unsubstantiated rumors" types, and will loudly insist that most proven allegations against Trump are part of some bizarre conspiracy theory.

I've said it before and I'll probably say it again, but voting individually is fine.  But especially if you're the sort of person who doesn't think that individual votes matter, [vote as a team]({% post_url 2020-10-11-vote %}).

 > ...hints of waning support for the president as Trump slumps in the polls and local Republican proxies like Sen. Joni Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds see precipitous drops in their approval ratings.

I don't enjoy being explicitly partisan, because parties always change over time, but there's a reason that Republicans consistently advocate against letting people vote:  Their positions are only beneficial to a tiny minority of people who are already well off and supported by other people who (openly---at this point, I don't think I'm saying anything "mean") want to see certain groups harmed more than them.  So, when more people vote, they lose.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth and seventh article that didn't fit into the week, but too relevant or weird to not mention.

 > The next day, a furious call came from the office of the vice president: The White House suggestions were not optional.

Remember when I said that Republican positions weren't helping people?  Here's one example.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [QAnon Fans Try to Explain Why Trump Took a Drug Developed With Fetal Tissue](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ayk5p/qanon-fans-try-to-explain-why-trump-took-a-drug-developed-with-fetal-tissue) from VICE News

 > More mainstream right-wing outlets are also attempting to "correct" the record on the antibody cocktail, mainly by baldly lying about it.

One of the most obnoxious aspects of the "pro-life" segment of the population is how quickly they turn a blind eye to the embryos they claim to cherish.  They only rarely object to fertility clinics---which necessarily dispose of unused embryos---except for people considered "extremists," such as Amy Coney Barrett.  And in cases where drugs that they need (or might need) use fetal stem cells, they're suddenly silent.  What they care about (or what the people who have convinced them to take their position care about) is controlling women.
