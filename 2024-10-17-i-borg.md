## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *star-trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## I, Borg

This post might run longer than the last bunch have, considering that it lands squarely in what we've hunted for...

 > Captain's log, stardate 45854.2. The *Enterprise* is charting six star systems that make up the Argolis cluster, an area being considered for colonization.

The cluster presumably takes its name from [the Greek region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argolis) or some predecessor entity.

Also, every time colonization comes up, I keep remembering [*The Ensigns of Command*]({% post_url 2023-05-11-ensigns-command %}), where they strongly implied that the Federation currently sits on potential colonies for decades, giving the claims to them more of a feel of a political statement or even an attempt at brinksmanship than population expansion or following resources.  That *could* imply an underlying motive behind the coincidence of this episode.

 > **TROI**: It's beautiful...but frightening at the same time.

I mentioned this as far back as [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), but it often feels like the Counselor's job has less to do with health care and much more to do with praising the show's staff...

 > **CRUSHER**: Captain, we can't leave him here. He won't survive.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I think the Captain understands that.

Once again, Picard has no qualms about leaving aliens to die.  I can understand Worf suggesting that they kill the Borg later, because he has slightly more information and has a job that demands that he make the recommendations that will protect the ship, no matter how awful it sounds.  Picard, though, hears the word Borg and immediately pulls the plug on the rescue mission.

 > **PICARD**: The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be brought to you there.

Wow, even *Data* smells something fishy in Picard's behavior...

 > **TROI**: Captain, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talk about.

Wait, will she actually try to *do her job*?  I mean, it doesn't really count if you only perform professionalism for your boss, or if you walk away immediately, but still...

 > **PICARD**: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you.

Not a new problem, but you'll notice Picard's obsession with looking strong and invulnerable.  Sure, an attacker captured him, mutilated him, and turned him into the leader of an army against his own people in [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-10-26-both-worlds-1 %}), but while lesser people would develop PTSD, *he* took a week off to get in a fist-fight with his brother in [*Family*]({% post_url 2023-11-16-family %}) to resolve his emotional issues like a normal, well-adjusted adult would.  Oh, and he reflexively almost let a teenager die because of his lingering bigotry, earlier in this episode.

I realize that I throw around the phrase "toxic masculinity" a lot, when talking about these characters, but seriously, if Picard also violated Troi's boundaries, here, then he'd have almost the entire concept nailed down in *one scene*.

 > **CRUSHER**: Infect it? You make it sound like a disease.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one.

If you wondered why I didn't talk about Picard finally feeling guilted into saving the kid's life, I ignored it because our role-model wants to *use* the kid as a vector to commit genocide.

And the crew takes the suggestion seriously.

 > **PICARD**: They've declared war on our way of life. We are to be assimilated.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: There are no civilians among the Borg.

Wow.  I knew this episode went to some dark places, but I didn't expect "war on our way of life" rhetoric, used for centuries by the far-right to fabricate pretexts for war.  These days, the "war" comes from acknowledging the existence of holidays in December other than Christmas, same-sex marriage, environmental regulation, and so forth.  And declaring everybody an "enemy combatant" always leaves militaristic societies with free rein to slaughter.  This crew managed to cram both into the space of a few seconds.

I originally wanted to credit Crusher as trying to [**Twelve Angry Men**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Angry_Men) the situation, but she folds almost immediately.

 > **CRUSHER**: What's he doing?

It looks like a repsonse to a [Mummenschanz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummenschanz) infestation, and so they'll probably need to spray...

 > **GUINAN**: You felt sorry for me. Look what it got you.

Oh, how wonderful.  We have the "Black woman in a science fiction story needs to learn about racism" clichÃ©.  How charming.

 > **LAFORGE**: That's gratitude for you.

I...don't like that they frame this as three Black men lording their authority over a prisoner of war.  We've seen some evidence that they *might* know what this feels like, and I feel like at least one of the performers should've not liked this.

 > **LAFORGE**: I've been rationing his portions of energy. I think he understands. When he cooperates, he gets fed. If not.

They have opted to *torture* a prisoner, to force him to cooperate in their scheme to commit genocide.

 > **CRUSHER**: I know, I know. We're at war. I'm here to help, but I don't have to like it.

Well, Crusher has neatly outlined the path to genocide, I suppose:  When you object, keep it to yourself and play along, so that you don't offend your colleagues.

 > **LAFORGE**: No, not you. Hugh.

And with that, Geordi immediately resigns from Starfleet to open a chain of "All Hugh Can Eat" restaurants where you pay for a few minutes of rationed electricity.

Really, though, this move feels so contrived, assigning him a name because it sounds like a random pronoun.

I almost suggested that something like "Cecil" would have made for better writing, since it transposes Hugh's designation to letters of the alphabet for the first letters.  But then I remembered how, in [*The Mind's Eye*]({% post_url 2024-04-18-mind-s-eye %}), the engineer saw listing items as a far harder problem if he had to alphabetize them, so...

 > **HUGH**: Here.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Thanks.

La Forge acts like handing off a prosthetic appalls him, as if he doesn't have a colleague who removes his hand or head occasionally, and he hasn't removed his vision prosthesis to show people, himself.

 > **LAFORGE**: You know, it's funny. When I first started creating this invasive program I didn't have a problem with it. The more I work with Hugh, the more I---

Yep.  We have actually watched this show long enough for an allegedly likeable character to tell us, "ethnic cleansing seemed like a pleasant diversion from my day job, at first, but now that I've grown to like one of the victims, I don't know..."

 > **LAFORGE**: Well, it was easier to have something to call him.

I apologize for not noticing and screaming about this when he coined the name, but it only now occurred to me now that he says this that Hugh *did* have "something to call him"---Third of Five---and they decided that it didn't count, because it doesn't sound like common names that they know.  And that seems especially wild, coming out of the mouth of the performer who portrayed (teenage) [Kunta Kinte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunta_Kinte) about fifteen years earlier in [**Roots**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_%281977_miniseries%29), given that the most famous scenes of adaptations, the scenes that people still talk about fifty years later[^2], revolve around the young man rejecting his slave-holders renaming him Toby, refusing to accept their attempts to dehumanize him, and suffering excessive corporal punishment for it.

[^2]:  Hari Kondabolu has a great bit about his Black neighbor asking a white toddler to say his name (Toby), then explains the reference when he realizes that the audience doesn't get it, which you can hear about sixteen minutes into [this episode of **Code Switch**](https://www.npr.org/2016/12/14/504482252/-hold-up-time-for-an-explanatory-comma), but you should listen to the whole episode...and probably everything that Kondabolu has worked on.

And while I don't give the show credit for much, and wish that it had connected those moments to *this* moment, note that the third season of **Picard** shows that the franchise has come around to this idea, despite all its other weird, regressive politics.  They want us to hate Captain Shaw for insisting on using Seven of Nine's human name, and try to give him redemption in his final scene by addressing her by her Borg designation, but he actually has stronger grounds for his bigoted position---she did use the name "Annika Hansen" at some point in her life and may have it listed in her official records as her legal name---than La Forge and the rest of these clowns do...

Anyway, I'll refer to him as Hugh throughout the post, because he *does* take on the name as his own, both here and later in the series/franchise, and rejects his former designation later.  But I did initially resist the idea, typing out "Third of Five" throughout early drafts of the post, on the basis that La Forge refused to recognize the kid's name as "too ethnic," and forced him to---dare I say it?---*assimilate* under implied threats of starvation.  Put another way that'll make you feel even worse about this feel-good episode, Hugh responds to the energy rationing in exactly the way that the Reynolds family wanted Kunta Kinte to respond to torture.

 > **GUINAN**: Do you know that you're the second person today to refer to that Borg as though it were some sort of lost child.

Well, if they refer to him more accurately as a teenage Prisoner of War (from a war that they have imagined), used for medical experimentation so that they can wipe out a rival culture, they start to sound less heroic, so yeah, they'll think of Hugh as "lost."  And in fairness, when they found him, "lost child" certainly applied.

 > **HUGH**: Resistance is not futile?

Because I'll probably never get that far through the franchise---through time or inclination---and already brought up the series, I should point out here that I wish that **Picard**'s writers had tied Hugh's realization here to the Jurati/Borg argument that the Borg approach will always fail, as long as they made most of the series revolve around the Borg anyway.

 > **LAFORGE**: Because you're different than we are. Part of what we do is to learn more about other species.

That interest in learning sounds much less high-minded now that we see them putting that knowledge to a specific end, doesn't it?  It reminds me a lot of [*A Matter of Honor*]({% post_url 2023-01-12-matter-honor %}), when Pulaski put her medical degree to use by teaching Riker how to murder Klingons, should the opportunity present itself.

 > **HUGH**: Are you ever lonely?
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Sometimes. But that's why we have friends.

Gasp!  What will the horrifyingly pornographic hologram of Leah Brahms think, Geordi, when she finds out that you've cheated on her by having real-world friends?  Or maybe he meant some hypothetical "we."

 > **PICARD**: Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used for experiments, scientists would sometimes become attached to the creatures. This would a problem if the experiment involved killing them. I would suggest that you un-attach yourself from the Borg, Mister La Forge.

This reminds me that Picard has almost nothing relevant to say about Dr. Russell's medical experimentation on his colleague in [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), even briefly supporting it.  And no experimental review board---except under totalitarian, racist regimes that have captured the scientific establishment---would clear "non-consentually addle the psyche of a teenager in order to commit mass murder" as an experiment, so I fail to see his point, other than that he views people as instruments to use in getting what he wants.

 > **PICARD**: It's not a person, dammit, it's a Borg!
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Because it's been given a name by a member of my crew doesn't mean it's not a Borg. Because it's young doesn't mean that it's innocent. It is what it is, and in spite of efforts to turn it into some kind of pet I will not alter my plans.

Note how he dismisses Hugh's personhood---based on his affiliation, no less, and by refusing to use a gendered pronoun---and then goes even further to insist that he doesn't even rate as a pet.

 > **PICARD**: Lieutenant, you may wait outside.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate its incorporation. Identify yourself.

I wonder if Picard sent Worf outside because everybody has---or should have---lingering doubts about Picard's loyalties.

 > **PICARD**: I think I deliberately avoided speaking with the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of our plan. But now that I have, he seems to be a fully realized individual. He has even accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus.

Ah, such a convenient euphemism, "our plan."  I realize that I keep harping on this, but Picard proposed that they use their Prisoner of War to annihilate all Borg through starvation.  When he talks about "our plan," as if they considered having a picnic lunch later, he means that, his plan to commit genocide by using a child as a weapon.

 > **PICARD**: Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than the enemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options.

I feel like genocide tips the scales from "no better" to "significantly worse" than the Borg who---I think that we can safely say based on how they presented themselves in *The Best of Both Worlds* and Hugh's comments in this episode about life in the Collective---want companionship, even though they don't have the vocabulary to explain that.

Incidentally, **I** won't do it, but it almost seems worth studying the evolution of the Borg through the franchise.  When we met them in [*Q Who?*]({% post_url 2023-03-09-q-who %}), they scavenged technology and didn't care about what happened to the meat-bots that they discarded in the process.  Guinan's recounting of the destruction of her world and few refugees fits that narrative.  When they returned for *The Best of Both Worlds*, they wanted to add people to their cube-shaped communes---starting with the person who taught them to care about human life---and it seems worth asking what changed.  I mean, yeah, the writers needing to rationalize the existence of Locutus happened in *our* world, but I mean the in-universe narrative.

As I said, I won't look at that as another project, given that we have hundreds more episodes to get through in this project.  But I do want to point the shift out, because it suggests that---unlike Picard and the Federation until this literal scene of the series---the Borg seem to have tried to learn and become more sensitive to the needs of their targets, recognizing them as life to preserve.  And now Hugh's shock suggests that the Borg don't understand that the civilizations that they absorb contain people who exist independently and prefer it that way.

When you look at *The Best of Both Worlds* with this idea that loneliness drives the Borg, and ignorance of solitary life guides their decisions, they don't look much different from how the scientists and crew reacted in [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %}) or [*Evolution*]({% post_url 2023-05-04-evolution %}).  After an error in judgment, they aggressively defended themselves when attacked, and had trouble believing that their victims mattered.  And yes, as Locutus, Picard told the *Enterprise* that, "from this time forward, you will service us," but in one of Picard's earliest comments about another culture, he said "if only every life form had as much desire to please," referring to the Denebians in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-26-farpoint2 %}), and the crew follows his every whim (including genocide), so that may have come from their interpretation of how Picard thinks about relationships more than an actual Borg philosophy.

They don't recognize it, in other words, but the crew and the Federation have almost certainly had opportunities to pursue peace, and have never taken them...until an episode of **Picard** accidentally does that for them, and then they sweep it under the carpet almost immediately so that they can go back to seething.

 > **LAFORGE**: Does that seems right, to help him become an individual and then take that away from him?

Correction, they *forced* him to become an individual---they starved him if he didn't cooperate, remember---then renamed him, all as a side effect of their plot to use him as a genocidal weapon against his own people.

 > **PICARD**: But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory, the sense of individuality which he has gained here might be transmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of the Borg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling of singularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious program of all. The knowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that brief moment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact.

Sigh.  You'll note that, now having learned (or pretended to learn) a valuable lesson about bigotry, Picard hopes that their act of mercy will *destroy the Borg*.

Missing from the episode's conversation, other than the "shut up and do what we tell you" sort, we never see the tension between individualism and cooperation, the latter activity you need fairly regularly to build a civilization.  It seems especially important to mention it, since the episode ends with Hugh making the point that he needs to put himself at risk to protect the crew.

 > **PICARD**: We could grant you asylum, Hugh.

Since Picard uses the word, I did a quick scan through prior posts.  It looks like Picard refused to grant asylum to the criminalized veteran with PTSD in [*The Hunted*]({% post_url 2023-07-13-hunted %}) and the person representing a persecuted minority in [*Transfigurations*]({% post_url 2023-10-19-transfigurations %}).  He joked about offering the (alleged) Romulan collaborator asylum in [*The Mind's Eye*]({% post_url 2024-04-18-mind-s-eye %}).  And he had lengthy debates on whether dissenters of the fascists deserved asylum in [*The Masterpiece Society*]({% post_url 2024-08-08-masterpiece-society %}), until grudgingly accepting their plea.

Given his consistent resistance to the idea, what makes Hugh so special in his eyes, that Picard offers him asylum *without* anybody requesting it?

Anyway, we'll check back in with Hugh in...probably May, if I counted right.

## Conclusions

This episode feels like it puts together a lot of the pieces that we've noticed over the run of the series so far, so apologies if this gets long.

### The Good

It takes them *forever* to get there, and they put him through an awful experience along the way, but they do eventually offer an abused (by them) kid asylum, now that he has become a political minority at risk of persecution by his home government.

### The Bad

The episode reminds us that nobody respects therapy, with the counselor limited to suggesting that her job might exist for a reason.  Picard likewise imagines that punching his brother a few times must have resolved his deep trauma.

We also have the main plot.  We see the Borg dismissed as sub-human vermin, not even worthy of somebody adopting them as pets.  When Picard suggests that they use a child as a weapon to kill all Borg, even the token resistance he receives dries up immediately.  They then torture that child, starving it, when he doesn't obey their orders, and treat it as disgusting when he does.  They force the child to assimilate into their culture, because the threat of starvation still hangs over every interaction.  And even when they start to acknowledge his individuality, they ignore their agency in the situation by referring to him as a "lost kid," rather than as a prisoner or abductee.  Even when they finally decide to treat the kid as a person with a right to his own life, they still hope that his experience will spread and cause destruction.

Related, they strongly imply that their interest in other forms of life includes an interest in ways to kill them.  And they seem to believe that animal experimentation will often involve killing the subject.

And we again see an authoritarian bend to how people cooperate, with questions about the ethics of genocide abandoned as an academic exercise to think about later, because Picard told them to do the work.

## Next

Come back in seven days, when we go full-Mark Twain[^1] with greatly exaggerated reports of deaths and people attending their own funerals, in *The Next Phase*.

[^1]:  Go figure, the episode may go "more Mark Twain" than the episodes that we'll talk about next month *with* Mark Twain...
