As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Carmen Miranda presents the Days of the Week.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Some quick bookkeeping before we get rolling, for those reading this on Friday...

- Congratulations to Minnesotans for standing together and organizing the first serious general strike in a long while.
- Best of luck for everybody in the path of the weekend storm that'll hit the United States from western Texas to both Florida and Maine; I should only get a lot of snow, but a lot of people may well get an inch or more of freezing rain, which might tear down power lines.  If I miss a post or two, you'll know that the freezing rain shifted north.

I think that covers the big deals.

 > ...instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices.

You probably already know that I hate the "prescient" framing, here.  The fact that we haven't fixed the country since the 1960s---no, actually more the 1870s---doesn't mean that talking about the situation then predicts anything about today.  That said, it *highlights* the problems, and what we need to do to start fixing them.

 > The protest’s main organizers are the Women’s March. The group came to prominence the day after President Donald Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, when it organized a massive nationwide protest, drawing hundreds of thousands of Americans to Washington, D.C.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Protest

It bothers me that word about this doesn't seem to have spread.  As I have worried before, while I support the recent wave of protests and appreciate that the size has demanded reporting on them instead of ignoring them, the organizers don't seem to work together, and keep the protests off in the corners where people *can* ignore them.  This seemed like the first one taking place during business hours, where it can make more of an impact than people standing around at a local park, but I also didn't hear anything about it until this article.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/115928519737484234)

 > The very moment that a man conceives the diabolic design of enslaving his brother’s body, that very moment does he also conceive the still more heinous design of fettering his will, for well does he know that in order to make his dominion supreme over the body, he must fetter the living spring of all its motions.

I have surely mentioned this before, but if you think back to the early days of COVID-19, then we already know the recipe for crushing authoritarianism in the United States:  Stay home and stop spending money.  You might recall that, when people did that, Republicans (including Trump) who compare social safety nets to feeding vermin started shoveling money at us to provide relief, and started clawing it back when people went back to working and shopping, rapidly adjusting the time to quarantine down, which seems to signal exactly how long they can hold out...

 > At the heart of reconstructionism lies the conviction that politics, economics, education and culture are all arenas where divine authority should reign. Secular democracy, they argued, was inherently unstable, a system built on human opinion rather than divine truth.

Have you ever noticed that, when people claim that they want their religion to control politics, they never seem to mean the parts where they have an obligation to treat people well?

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/115939823261208095)

 > A just and reasonable modesty does not only recommend eloquence, but sets off every talent which a man can be possessed of. It heightens all the virtues which it accompanies; like the shades of paintings, it raises and rounds every figure, and makes the colors more beautiful, though not so glowing as they would be without it.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.
