To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Norte

The book's page provides the following synopsis.

> No espaço entre Buenos Aires, os desertos de Catamarca e a Patagônia aos pés da cordilheira andina, Téo Miranda está deslocado de seu território habitual. Acostumado a investigar adultérios na São Paulo urbana, o detetive particular descobre-se em paragens remotas, contra o vento e a poeira, na busca por um tio desaparecido há mais de trinta anos.
>
> Marcada por curvas imprevistas e a aridez da Ruta Nacional 40, a investigação se torna ainda mais difícil pela companhia insistente de Gustavo, com quem Téo mantém um relacionamento incerto. O detetive logo se dá conta de que para encontrar o tio precisa compreender seus motivos, mas a tarefa o obrigará a enfrentar suas próprias inseguranças --- ou correr o risco de se perder nesse eterno meio de caminho no rumo do fin del mundo.

Or, for those like myself who don't read Portuguese, that translates to this.

> In the space between Buenos Aires, the deserts of Catamarca, and Patagonia, at the foot of the Andean mountain range, Téo Miranda finds himself displaced from his usual area. Used to investigating adultery in urban São Paulo, the private detective finds himself in remote locations, against wind and dust, searching for an uncle who disappeared more than thirty years ago.
>
> Marked by unforeseen turns and the aridity of the National Route 40, the investigation becomes even more difficult by Gustavo's insistent company, with whom Téo maintains an uncertain relationship. The detective soon realizes that to find his uncle, he needs to understand his motives, but the task will force him to face his own insecurities --- or risk getting lost in this eternal middle ground on the way to the end of the world.

As you can guess from the blurb, I'll read this in shoddy machine translation, so may miss some nuances.  Also, based on the crowdfunding campaign, it looks like that version printed to 180 pages, suggesting that we probably don't have the full book in the repository, similarly meaning that I might not spot something critical.

## What Works Well?

Focusing the attention almost exclusively on Téo and Gustavo's relationship surprised me, but felt welcome.  It doesn't translate quite as well as the first half did, but the emotions and dialogue still feel vibrant.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The story seems to fall apart, here.  We meet Téo's family, but dismiss them almost instantly, after a serious build-up of whether he can finally come out to his family.  And then it ends with our couple on another road trip, heading off to find the person that Téo allegedly needed to find back at the beginning, making it seem like the pitched plot didn't feel worth wrapping up.

As I mentioned before, we might not have the full version of the story, here, explaining that incompleteness.  The crowdfunding campaign promises a hundred eighty pages, whereas the ten thousand words that we have would more typically print to somewhere closer to less than forty pages.

## Opportunities

The Codeberg repository exists, though it hasn't seen any activity since the crowdfunding campaign.  I imagine that, especially since the campaign beat the target by eighty percent, you can probably buy the book somewhere.

## What's Adaptable?

I didn't catch any named items other than the real-world cities.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll watch the **Sol Levante** animated short.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the book?
