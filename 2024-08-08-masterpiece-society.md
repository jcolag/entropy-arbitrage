## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## The Masterpiece Society

Let's jump right into this nonsense...

 > Captain's log, stardate 45470.1. The Enterprise has been diverted to the Moab sector to track a stellar core fragment of a disintegrated neutron star. Our science teams have been asked to monitor the planetary disruptions it may cause.

They appear to have named a sector after the Levantine [Kingdom of Moab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab).

 > **PICARD**: Any starships ever reported missing in this sector, Mister Data?

It seems worrisome that Picard would need to request this information, no?  It seems as if it would make far more sense to geo-fence---*astro-fence*, I guess---areas where ships had gone missing and automatically alert crews as they approach.

 > **PICARD**: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship *Enterprise*. It is urgent that you respond.
 >
 > **WORF**: Sir, defensive shield around the structure is increasing in strength.

Ah, the ever-present great reputation of the Federation...

 > **CONOR**: Genetically engineered. Our ancestors came from Earth to develop a perfect society. They believed that through controlled procreation, they could create people without flaws and those people would build a paradise.

We've seen the Federation try to get in on this action, too, you might remember.  [*Unnatural Selection*]({% post_url 2023-01-05-unnatural-selection %}) hinged on children engineered for power, and they primarily objected to the clone society in [*Up the Long Ladder*]({% post_url 2023-03-23-up-long-ladder %}) because they didn't have a wide enough genetic diversity.  And that doesn't count all the eugenics-infused comments that they've made about certain space-ethnicities having specific inherent predispositions or how they'll throw around ableist terminology that originates with eugenics.

 > **LAFORGE**: I can see you just fine, sir.

Speaking of ableist terminology, you'll notice that La Forge has enough familiarity with ableist creeps that he had a pithy and pointed response ready.

 > **CONOR**: I have been bred to fill this specific role. We grow up knowing exactly what our society needs from us. What we are expected to do.
 >
 > **RIKER**: That must take some of the fun out it?

Since everybody in the group seems to agree with him, I can only imagine that the Federation considers the joy of youth to come from scrambling to figure out how you'll pay the bills for the next several decades.

 > **TROI**: We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it.

I want you all to remember this, how they treat the xenophobic eugenicists in this episode.  With the colony under threat, the *Enterprise* pledges to put effort in to preserve everything.  We might have reason to come back to this in the coming months.

I mentioned, for episodes such as *Up the Long Ladder* and [*The Hunted*]({% post_url 2023-07-13-hunted %}), that the Federation seems to value few things as much as a society of predominantly white folks wearing business attire.  Here, that means absolutely adoring the eugenicists who surely will have no dark secrets or dishonest plans, because...well, *look at them*.

 > **TROI**: I feel the same about being here. I'm something of a student of human nature, and I find this all fascinating.

Wait, when did *that* happen?  I would call her a student of *chocolate*, and maybe of enforcing whatever authoritarian dictates spill out of Picard's larynx, but not of human nature.  In fact, in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}), she made it absolutely clear that she doesn't care about her patients beyond making sure that their non-happy feelings don't psychically intrude on her.

 > **LAFORGE**: We have a matter-antimatter warp reaction system, the most powerful in the Starfleet. Normally, it kicks plasma up into the terawatt range. Why?

I talked about what "the terawatt range" and its likelihood when we discussed [*The Dauphin*]({% post_url 2023-01-26-dauphin %}), so I won't bore you with it again now.

New, however, and of note, he mentions that the *Enterprise* has the most powerful warp engine in Starfleet.

 > **PICARD**: They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavor into dogma.

Wait, why does Picard agree with me?  Did he not get a look at those snazzy blazers?  Or maybe he actually finally learned a lesson after getting fooled five times with the same setup...

 > **PICARD**: They've given away their humanity with this genetic manipulation. Many of the qualities that they breed out, the uncertainty, the self-discovery, the unknown, those are many of the qualities that make life worth living. Well, at least to me. I wouldn't want to live knowing that my future was written, that my boundaries had been already set, would you?

Oh, I see.  Picard's distaste of the society ties into Riker's out-of-touch "the joy in life comes from the possibility of dying at any moment" weirdness, *not* because of eugenics itself.  That makes much more sense compared to what we've seen before, typical wealthy white-guy/imperialist "the world needs more challenges for aristocrats to conquer" rhetoric...

 > **LAFORGE**: Who gave them the right to decide whether or not I should be here? Whether or not I might have something to contribute.

See, *this* works as an argument against eugenics, even though he buried it in obsessions with productivity, not Picard and Riker bloviating about destiny or whatever...

 > **LAFORGE**: If the answer to all of this is in a visor created for a blind man who never would have existed in your society. No offense intended.

This also works fairly well as an argument, a variation of the [curb cut effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect), if you will, that making places and tools more accessible for people with specific difficulties makes them easier for almost all of us.

 > **CONOR**: Please, Matthew, continue.

Matthew plays Chopin's *Prelude in E minor (Op. 28 No. 4)*.

 > **CONOR** + **TROI**: All the King's horses and all the King's Men, couldn't put Humpty together again.

Yes, they still tell the grand saga of [*Humpty Dumpty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_Dumpty), which...did you know that it only became so popular because of a long-running 1860s Broadway musical?  I feel like I need to see this musical...

 > **TROI**: This is wrong.

...Why?

I mean, I don't want to fault her for setting boundaries, even boundaries that she has no interest in maintaining for more than maybe a quarter of a second, but nothing about this relationship screams "wrong," as long as she grooves on the whole "Master Race" deal.  He hasn't attacked her, created sex toys in her image (that we've seen), ethereally impregnated her, or manipulated her into hiding his abilities, which makes this her healthiest relationship in the series so far, as far as I can tell.

Don't get me wrong, here.  You don't really get eugenicists without concentration camps and forced births, because it doesn't have a point beyond trying to maximize the value of elite men's genetic legacies, so the relationship probably wouldn't go particularly well for her.  But I don't see where this violates any of her alleged principles.

 > **CONOR**: You're up early.

Wait, Troi plays the piano, even this twiddling, and they focus on her love of chocolate instead as a character trait?  The '90s went to weirder places than I remember.

 > **TROI**: I could fall in love with you so easily, but we both know the end of that story, don't we? How would Martin feel about introducing half-Betazoid DNA into the genetic balance?

Oh, hey, look, she *finally* noticed the tiny flaw in their grand design, the aggressive bigotry...

 > **CONOR**: I need you here. This doesn't have to happen again.

Yeah, I didn't exaggerate when I described eugenics as caring about men's legacies.  Even Conor knows the score...

 > **LAFORGE**: Enterprise, you may begin transport when ready.

I like how, on this super-tight emergency schedule that they all have planned for, the engineers decide to stand around looking off into the middle-distance, instead of getting to work.

 > **DATA**: Termination of all life support in five seconds.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **WORF**: Life support normal on all decks.

Not to act completely ghoulish about this, but if life support "reboots" this quickly, why care about the failures at all?  They could've breathed stale air and let the temperature drop a few degrees for a few minutes without any ill effects, at least.

 > **WORF**: Why shouldn't we grant them asylum?
 >
 > **TROI**: We can't do that.

In case you missed above, where I pointed out Troi's admission that she has no non-psychic empathy for people in *The Loss*, she opposes providing political sanctuary on the grounds that it would upset their home government.

 > **PICARD**: We may have done too much to help them already, Doctor.

Wow, I laugh a lot at Picard, but he keeps finding lower depths to sink to.  He now regrets saving thousands of lives, because their survival might mean some political strife, as people question their eugenics policy.

 > **TROI**: Computer, halt. Captain, I have to tell you something, and it isn't easy for me because I've used very poor judgement. Actually, I've acted quite unprofessionally.

It would bring me so much glee if this became a two-part episode, so that Troi has the time necessary to recount every time during the past four-and-a-half seasons that she did something unprofessional.

 > **PICARD**: But you didn't. And that's human. We make mistakes. Genetic manipulation or not, nobody's perfect.

I have to appreciate how one of Picard's few moments of tenderness with colleagues amounts to, "well, sure, who *hasn't* given serious thought to shacking up with a Nazi?"  I keep telling you that they'll forgive anything of people wearing snappy blazers.

 > **TROI**: Hannah, let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Why don't we go for a walk?

Eugenics-curious to the end, Troi *really* instructed an asylum-seeker to let the grown-ups decide her fate in private, apparently because the decision has nothing to do with her...

 > **PICARD**: If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their human rights.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask for transport away from here.

Note that creepy qualification.  He might ignore a Klingon or Vulcan, but a *human*...?

 > **CONOR**: Perhaps it's your imperfections which make you so unique. But I am in love with you, Deanna Troi, and I will always be.

Creepy right to the end.  And they wonder why a woman leads the movement to get out of here...

 > **PICARD**: If we ever needed reminding of the importance of the Prime Directive, it is now.

Again, I need to make the point that he assesses thousands of lives as having less value than the preservation of an abstract "way of life"---his next line, which I won't quote---that looks a lot like what the Nazis and their supporters imagined.  In other words, he wonders if he should have let them all die to protect them from people realizing that they live in a terrible culture that treats them like tools.

## Conclusions

Other than *Humpty Dumpty*, we don't really get much out of this mess...

### The Good

We do *occasionally* see brief flashes of opposition to the idea of eugenics, mostly by the people who the society would never accept.

### The Bad

As usual, computers have terrible interfaces, waiting for requests like "should we know anything important about our current location?"

The Federation seems to still have an awful reputation, with even separatist human cultures powering up their defenses when they hear who has shown up on their doorsteps.

We also see indications that people with disabilities receive enough offensive comments that they prepare for them.

Everybody also seems to have a significant respect for eugenics, wanting to protect their isolationism and segregation, as long as the elites look respectable.  They only really object to the concept because they dislike the idea of a world where people can't succeed or fail at their careers through randomness and social connections.  They also don't know if they want to provide asylum to people who find these societies problematic, because they would rather prioritize the stability of the culture, and don't even see a reason for the asylum-seekers to participate in the conversation.

Once again, we see that people seem to think of their healthiest and least-inappropriate romantic relationships as the embarrassing choices to avoid or cover up.

We also get a reminder that Starfleet officers don't really bother to do their jobs, preferring to conspicuously stand around instead of saving the people from destruction.

We get a hint that humans have a priority in asylum claims over anybody else.

## Next

In seven days, we watch some rando take advantage of the crew's hangover to get them to work on his pet project, in *Conundrum*.
