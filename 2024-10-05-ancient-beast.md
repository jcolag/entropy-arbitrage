This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) plays **Ancient Beast**.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Ancient Beast**
 * Location:  <https://ancientbeast.com/>, <https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast>
 * Released:  2011 --
 * License:  AGPL (code), CC BY-SA (assets)
 * Creator:  [Freezing Moon](https://freezingmoon.org) and a significant community of contributors
 * Medium:  Video game
 * Length:  Approximately ten minutes per game
 * Content Advisories:  Armed violence, some horror-themed creatures, out-of-game cryptocurrency economy.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Ancient Beast

The repository describes the project as follows.

 > **Ancient Beast** is a turn based strategy indie game project played online against other people featuring a wide variety of creatures to acquire, putting them to use in order to defeat your opponents. This project was carefully designed to be easy to learn, fun to play and hard to master. We hope you'll enjoy it!

I don't think that I can add much to that.  You go to the game's page, configure how you want the session to work, and play.

## What Works Well?

The game looks nice, which sounds uninteresting, but consider the variety of ideas, ranging from implausibly cartoon-like to provocative with a lot of stock fantasy material in between, that need to coexist on the same board and in different settings.  For example, the Gumble and the Hornhead ({% emoji musical notes %} should be friends... {% emoji musical notes %}) don't seem like they could ever fit the same world, more so when you have something like the Swine Thug, but the art makes most of them seem like you'd find them near each other.  The same goes for the music, which despite coming from a variety of composers and splitting into two genres, provides a similar feel.

The game also plays well, for the most part.  While the strategy side will probably elude a lot of people for a while, like it does myself, I don't see many people having trouble figuring out the mechanics of play, other than poor terminology requiring you to "skip turn" to end your turn after taking it.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I suppose that this holds true about most strategy games in this vein, but I find the process tedious.  Every turn, it seems like every unit needs to move their full distance, and the effects of various actions feel extremely unclear.  And I suppose that the "strategy" part comes in around that point to make it more useful, but it really does feel like busy-work, a lot of the time, at least for me.

Compounding that minor problem, the game doesn't have anything like a single-player mode, where less-experienced players can try to learn from even a terrible AI.  But it also means that, to play, you need to either drag somebody else over to your computer with you or play against yourself, neither of which feels satisfying in context.

And while this doesn't *necessarily* need to reflect on the game itself, I do need to call out the bad optics of the sort of company that they seem to keep, with advertising from online casinos and places to buy fake (or otherwise low-utility) social media followers.  I suspect that their accepting and paying bounties in cryptocurrency will probably turn a lot of people off, too.  Add in using big-corporate communications platforms (except for Mega and Telegram) for everything, and it all feels at least mildly shady.

## Opportunities

I would start on their [contributing](https://ancientbeast.com/contribute/) page, which explains sending them money, adding art or audio, fixing code, joining [their Discord server](https://discord.me/AncientBeast), and more, with little leaderboards for everything.

If the code interests you most, the project has an active repository on GitHub, with version 0.4 on the horizon.  You can also read their [contributing guide](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), from which I'll quote the relevant parts here.

 > #### Token Bounties
 >
 > Many of the issues and open tasks have bounties specified in the title, for example: `[bounty: 5 XTR]`, indicating the amount of [XatteR](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/wiki/Token) that will be given to the person that solves the issue(s). You can read more about our utility token in our detailed wiki article [over here](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/wiki/Token).

I imagine that should cover it.  I mean, it would *have* to, right...?  And I admit that the project seems at least somewhat money-hungry, for some reason, with sponsorships on top of at least six crowdfunding or donation routes, not to mention paying for work through an unknown cryptocurrency.  As such, maybe be careful getting involved.

## What's Adaptable?

The story of two Dark Priests fighting strikes me as fairly flimsy, but the game does provide a wide variety of "monsters."  And while they might not fit every fantasy setting---many of them have quirky appearances in one way or another---that serves to increase the odds that something *will* work.  And if you dig around the Mega archives in particular, you'll find assets such as the [Blender](https://blender.org) models.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll start "sampling" another longer work, spending four weeks reading the first six chapters of **Restoration Day** by Deborah Makarios, starting with the first two, *Trouble Brewing* and *Downhill from Here*.  If you get to *Recognition*, then you've gone too far.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
