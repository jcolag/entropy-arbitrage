* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...not only as a strong leader but also as a more profoundly thoughtful and spiritual person, in touch with her ancestral knowledge and the natural environment around her.

I knew nothing about this story, before, but I now want much more...

 > If these reports aren‚Äôt ignored altogether, women who file them can end up having their morals questioned or their reputations sullied. They may face retaliation, such as getting demoted.

I should note that this can cut the other way, too.  The article talks about who gets punished, but victims often don't *want* punishment at all.  They want the offending behavior to stop.  Therefore, in companies that do focus on punishing for any harassment---an improvement over doing nothing, yes---victims often also feel reluctant to report, because that makes them seem responsible for someone losing their job, when they could have apologized and learned better behavior.

 > No one in a position of authority, it appears, has asked this question. Nor is anyone exactly responsible for doing so.

I have two thoughts about this story.

First, the Santos campaign ran repulsive ads showing the horrors of "Joe Biden's America," which seem to revolve around the existence of non-white women who speak up.  I don't care that he lied.  I care that his "platform" centers hatred, and it bothers me that nobody in media or politics seems to want to bring that up, instead talking about him like a clever trickster hero who we happen to disagree with.

Also, though, this mess goes back to the Obama/McCain campaign.  The lack of framework for publicly validating candidates allowed racist birtherism to thrive on the far right, while ignoring legitimate questions about McCain's eligibility.  I mean, at the time of McCain's birth, we did *not* automatically extend citizenship to children born on military bases.  We have rectified that flaw---and I do see it as a flaw---in the laws since then, but we can't call him native-born.  And yet, *nobody* questioned his eligibility, and nobody stepped forward to assert that they had proven Obama's eligibility.

As a result of this sort of mess, how long do you think we have before someone like a certain Twitter CEO follows his [contradictory claims about his degree](https://archive.ph/gzGpF) claiming that his mother *actually* gave birth to him in Kentucky?  And who stops him?

I decided to test the waters of Post more directly, figuring I'd go more overtly political than usual, since (a) the topic does bother me since Santos "represents" part of my area and (b) politics seems the order of the day on the service.

 > Known to decline with age, membrane potential is a topic of great interest in the scientific community because of its potential role in a number of age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders.

I admittedly don't have the background to understand much of the science, here, but it *sounds* promising.

I have to applaud this, but you can probably guess that based on how much media criticism that I write about and re-post.  Even if we ignore the political, people need to understand when a report or ad wants to diminish critical thinking or eliminate competitors.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Maya people shopped at places like today‚Äôs supermarkets](https://www.futurity.org/maya-market-economy-2854182/) from Futurity

 > Horowitz set out to address this knowledge gap for the K‚Äôiche‚Äô by examining the production and distribution of obsidian artifacts, which are used as a proxy by archeologists to determine the level of economic development in a region.

Notice how we keep learning that what we know about ancient communities---especially in the Americas---mostly comes through a colonial lens that requires people to appear backward and/or dependent.  When we look at the actual evidence, though, their world looks increasingly like ours.
