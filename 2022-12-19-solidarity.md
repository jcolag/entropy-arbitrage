Tomorrow, we celebrate [International Human Solidarity Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Human_Solidarity_Day), an observance to honor unity in diversity, raise awareness, and commit to solving global issues.

![A dance at a Wikipedia event on the unity-in-diversity theme](/blog/assets/Unity-In-Diversity-Opening-Ceremony-Wiki-Conference-India-CGC-Mohali-2016-08-05-6656.png "Somewhere, there exists a United-Nations-Backing-a-Dance-Dance-Revolution joke in this, but I don't have it...")

If you still don't believe me that Christmas splatters across December and part of January, today doesn't have its own explicit holiday that spans multiple traditions, but [Saturnalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia)---a Roman precursor to Christmas that includes [Opiconsivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiconsivia) marking the end of harvest season---started on Saturday, and both the Latine [Las Posadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Posadas) and Filipino [Simbang Gabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simbang_Gabi) began on Friday.  All continue through the week...again, for those times when someone starts complaining that somebody *dared* to wish them "happy holidays."

And for the actual reason that most people prefer to wish people happy holidays, sunset marked the start of [Hanukkah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah).  While not the most important holiday in the Jewish religion, it has grown in cultural importance, probably for reasons comparable to the ascent of Christmas in Christian culture:  People like celebrations focusing on light and togetherness near the shortest days of the year.

On to the software talk.

## Social Media

In what I can only imagine required an all-hands processing of thousands of requests, you can now [find me on Cohost](https://cohost.org/jcolag).  Whether I post there beyond new blog post announcements, like anywhere, will depend on whom I find there.

I may talk about this in more depth, at some point---it sounds like a piece for the mailing list---but a lot of the "Twitter replacements" feel disappointing.  I like a lot of what I see in the software, so I don't fault the teams.  Rather, I fault the "Twitter expatriates" who don't have any feel for culture, and post exactly as they would on Twitter:  Everything provokes outrage, and everything must have some deeper meaning.

## Library Updates

As with [last week]({% post_url 2022-12-12-kanji %}), this past week has gone primarily to library updates for [**Picture to Nonogram**](https://github.com/jcolag/picture-nonogram), [**Slackup**](https://github.com/jcolag/slackup), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), and [**Scan Data**](https://github.com/jcolag/ScanData), [**Renew DB**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB).

## Next

Based on the remaining library updates in the queue, I'd expect cleaning those up to take me at least through this week, and a good part of the remaining way to the new year.
