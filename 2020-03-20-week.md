As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Maryland Suddenly Looks Like it Might Break John Deere's Repair Monopoly](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7ekzw/maryland-suddenly-looks-like-it-might-break-john-deeres-repair-monopoly) from VICE

 >  "The opposition that’s been most visible is from John Deere," Scarr told Motherboard over the phone ahead of the committee hearing. "We've heard rumors that they've cut a deal with the American Farm Bureau to keep the Farm Bureau from lobbying in support of the bill."

For context on this, see [John Deere Thinks People Will Pirate Music With In-Car Computers](https://gizmodo.com/john-deere-thinks-people-will-pirate-music-with-in-car-1695574031).
