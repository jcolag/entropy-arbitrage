* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## Preemptions

As I mentioned in [this week's developer diary post]({% post_url 2025-06-23-midsummer %}#argh), much to my chagrin, my newer laptop unexpectedly bought the farm, if you will, leaving me with my previous laptop...from (Internet suggests) 2013 or so. You can guess how well that has gone. But for this post, the main problem comes from losing access to my RSS reader, which drives the Friday posts.

I could have tried to write about the ill-advised bombing of Iran, or Emil Bove, or Supreme Court shenanigans, or the Senate imploding over the "big, beautiful bill," or whatever, without referring to my usual news sources, but as long-time readers know, I don't see myself as or want to act the part of a journalist. Indulge me this one week, then, with a short break in format.

If I can't find a better solution by Sunday night, I'll rely heavily on newsletters instead of RSS.

 > Looking over at [#NYC](https://mastodon.social/tags/NYC) from a couple-dozen miles out, it's pretty funny to watch every journalist talk about the "stunning upset" that the young guy who had a good pitch beat the disgraced sex offender whose pitch was...that he'd just win, I guess? Yeah, stunning.

 > Reminds me of the former(?) truism that you need to read newspapers to understand New York State government, because politicians regularly manipulate(d) TV/radio journalists.

To follow up on this, and/or to explain to those of you not following New York politics on the why-would-you basis, young Democratic-Socialist Zohran Mamdani completely trashed Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary on Wednesday.  And good.  I don't think that anybody but Republicans really wanted to see Cuomo back in the public eye, because then Republicans and (same thing) Eric Adams could hammer him with credible accusations of sexual harassment, failure to manage COVID-19 early on, and general corruption.

Why did this shock anybody?  As I hinted in the second half of my toot, New York once had---and maybe still has, but I don't know the space well enough to say---a long tradition of the newspapers and the TV/radio news having almost diametrically opposed views of state governance.  This would happen, least-cynically at least, because print journalists would live in Albany and cover everything in-place, whereas major TV and radio journalists had a New York City studio eight hours away, where politicians would come to them.

This set up a dynamic where, if you followed broadcast media, you would only ever see politicians at their best and most polished, showing up when they had time on their schedules, and well-prepared for the interview.  In print, though, the beat reporters showed up on their terms, whether watching legislative votes or asking impertinent questions while the officials went about their normal business.

Anyway, maybe as a result of this, or maybe because major media outlets have billionaire owners who would really not see a rent freeze on properties that they might own, the media lined up behind calling Cuomo a front-runner, largely on the basis that nobody knew Zohran Mamdani's name.  And it looks a lot like Cuomo tried to coast, getting billionaire funding to run a smear campaign, and not having much more of a platform than having beefed with Trump a couple of times.

What happened to current mayor Eric Adams?  Well, having burned his bridges in the Republican Party by becoming a Democrat, and subsequently burning his bridges in the Democratic Party by cozying up to Trump to get his corruption charges swept under the rug, he has decided to run as an independent candidate, on a one-issue "support ICE so that I stay out of prison" platform.  Cuomo has *also* floated a third-party run, by the way.

Over on the Republican side, by the way, *they* hilariously nominated [Curtis Sliwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa), an outspoken bigot---of the "I see myself more of a centrist" variety---and former ringleader of various vigilante gangs[^1], and so he campaigned on the alleged constant crime happening everywhere that you can't currently see and the need for far more policing.

[^1]:  The inane beret that you always see him wearing comes from his "Guardian Angels" uniform, his vigilante group that spent decades literally "patrolling" low-income areas and public spaces looking for potential criminals.

And look, I live close enough to the city to visit, but have never lived in the city limits.  But assuming that Cuomo does come back for a second round, this could feel like an absolutely wild election, with two anti-immigrant/pro-incarceration candidates, a self-entitled brat trying to get back into the public eye, and one candidate with an actual platform of helping people, but the most viable candidate follows Islam and has brown skin, not to mention identifying as a socialist, which I think we all know by now puts him at a disadvantage with at least the media, no matter what the people want.  In other words, expect plenty of "too young," "too radical," "maybe said something offensive once," "wore white after Labor Day," "didn't like one of his mother's movies," and similar stories hoping to discredit him.

Actually, I have something for this, as a reply to someone more famous than me [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/114751826669304696), thinking of this as a real horse-race calling them...

- Under Trump's Thumb
- Literal Vigilante
- Disgraced Sex Pest
- Muslim Socialist

Again, think of watching horses with a rapid-fire announcer. Well, I liked it.

Will Mamdani do a good job if elected? I have no clue, but the over three certainly won't, so I know which way *I'd* vote in the general election if I lived a couple of counties further over...

 > Too many lives at stake to act glib, BUT as a story, the #Iran bombing dysfunction would get a laugh out of me. No plan, maybe later, but also a careful plan. Definite success, because literally the climactic Star Wars plot point. But maybe not. But definitely. But we did give them warning to move everything.

 > Again, if we didn't have Iranian, Israel, American, and other lives in the balance, this would make great comedy.
