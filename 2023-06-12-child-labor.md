Today marks the [World Day Against Child Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_Against_Child_Labour)---OK, technically "Labour," since the ILO has worked out of Europe for over a hundred years, but I don't feel like hassling with the spell-checker---which raises awareness of and tries to spur activism against child labor.  This probably hasn't seemed like a big deal for most of us in recent years, but states with reactionary leadership in the United States have spent a lot of the past couple of years loosening restrictions on child labor laws in an effort to drive down wages...on top of deliberately acting cruel to children, by shielding their employers from liability in the case of workplace injuries.

Since I can't think of much to say about that, I'll move on to programming...or more pushing library versions around.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump (finally) versions of libraries for the [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), [**CPREP Background Generator**](https://github.com/jcolag/background-generator), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Miniboost**](https://github.com/jcolag/Miniboost), [**Picture to Nonogram**](https://github.com/jcolag/picture-nonogram), [**Renewal Database**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB), [**Scan Data**](https://github.com/jcolag/ScanData), [**Slack-up**](https://github.com/jcolag/slackup), and [**Zoea**](https://github.com/jcolag/zoea).

## Secret Project?

I don't want to give away too much before its time, because I have a specific release date in mind for it---you'll understand my reasons when we get there, in a couple of months---but I spent a while working on a small game.  I'll have more to say about it when I release everything...

## Next

Bet on my continuing to push through updating these libraries, to try to get them up to date.
