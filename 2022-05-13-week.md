As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license.  Most have not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1523649738330959872) [What we can deduce from a leaked PDF](https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/what-we-can-deduce-from-a-leaked-pdf.html) from Matthew Butterick

 > In sum---I'd suppose it's a friend, spouse, or family member of a Supreme Court justice who has consis­tently opposed Roe v. Wade...

This confirms many of my own suspicions about the leak.  My personal guess is that Alito had a family member leak it, in hopes of maintaining a splintering majority.

I *hope* that conservative ire against the leaker continues, and that they hound him to retire, showing him that he misplaced his fears in "the woke mob."  And once that dam cracks, Justice Thomas seems ineligible to sit on the bench, for attempting to aid the insurrection, based on the Fourteenth Amendment.  And then we have three Justices---Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett---who have made themselves impeachable for perjuring themselves during their confirmation hearings.

It might be fantasy, but it would amuse me greatly if all the Republicans' efforts to pack the Supreme Court with unqualified, right-wing ideologues led to winning them an 8-1 *liberal* majority.

 > Over the last decade, she has undertaken a conscious process of "de-demonizing" the party in an effort to distance itself from its antisemitic past.

Oddly, the article overlooks how the right wing of American politics *did* replicate this process, but did so generations ago.  At least Reagan and both Bushes came into office by playing down what their [dog whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_%28politics%29) meant and who their policies harmed.  The [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement) chipped away at that cultivated image, pushing more radical candidates and forcing out any Republican who expressed moderate views or compromised with Democrats, leading to the 2008 Republican primaries, where candidates tried to out-bigot each other.

I honestly fouled up the scheduling, here.  Sorry!

 > This essentially invites bigoted state legislators to pass unconstitutional laws banning 'sodomy' and revoking same-sex marriage.

As I mentioned in my post on Sunday [about abortion rights]({% post_url 2022-05-08-alito %}), the draft doesn't "essentially invite" *anything*.  The draft includes an explicit list of decisions that Alito says that the Supreme Court should overturn.  He includes same-sex marriage, interracial marriage, sodomy, contraception, and many other issues, and I honestly don't know why so many writers want to avoid that specificity, instead treating this like a normal overly broad decision that *might* eventually ripple into other legal areas.

 > Even if you don't know it, you probably know someone who's had an abortion. One in four women in this country have ended a pregnancy, whether because it was life-threatening, nonviable, unaffordable, or they simply didn't want it.

Something else that I mentioned in the Sunday post, criminalizing abortion gives states the right to deprive voting rights to this quarter of women.  Alito doesn't mention repealing the Nineteenth Amendment, but we know that Republican-appointed Justices have not agreed with voting rights in the past, so we need to figure this in as a possible added motivation.

Likewise, under the Thirteenth Amendment, conviction of a crime *does* permit forced servitude as a punishment...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Television Is in a Showrunning Crisis](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxeze/television-is-in-a-showrunning-crisis) from VICE

 > Until fairly recently, it was a bit of industry jargon that denoted a combination of head writer and executive producer keeping the whole machine moving as it should; it was a flexible title that worked for whatever a particular show needed.

This reflects a lot of the feelings that I've experienced in the last few years watching television.  I frequently find myself watching shows to boost the metrics---I want more shows *like* this one or that one---but I don't really enjoy the time watching them, as the shows sputter through their season-long arcs, and often seem to forget what the characters have worked on.  In science fiction in fantasy, the seasons lumber through complex ideas, to get to the fancy climax of CGI punching that...nobody cares about, because the animation directors stage and cut them poorly.

This goes a long way towards explaining it, beyond simply "I probably aged out of the demographic" or "the products of late-stage capitalism make me feel queasy."  Both of those explanations have some truth to them, of course, but "writers have nobody to steer" helps explain how pervasive the problem can often seem, even for shows that I enjoyed just a few years ago.
