## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Inheritance

Since last we spoke, the crew over on **DS9** dealt with the most science fiction love triangle available, in *Second Sight*.  People found that episode self-indulgent, so this episode would like you to hold its beer, as the kids[^1] say...

[^1]:  I have no idea if actual kids currently say or previously said that, but humor me for now.

 > **JULIANA**: Yes, I certainly was. And I was also his wife. In a way, I suppose you could say I am your mother.

Add another secret family member to the list.

Also, if you spend a lot of time around Irish media, then you might recognize Secret Mom as [Fionnula Flanagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionnula_Flanagan).  We'll see sometime next year, probably, that she already appeared in the franchise earlier in 1993 in a relatively minor part in *Dax*, over on **Deep Space Nine**, and would go on to play a Vulcan ambassador on **Enterprise**.

Maybe of interest, given that his name comes up occasionally in this series, she looks like a James Joyce fan, having written the stage version of and starred in the film adaptation of [**James Joyce's Women**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce%27s_Women), about pretty much what it sounds like, and has appeared in other Joyce-related productions.

 > **JULIANA**: That's what I called it. You were like a baby, at first. A hundred kilogram baby, but still. You had trouble learning your motor skills, learning how to process sensory information. And of course Noonian was never satisfied. He kept tinkering, trying to make you as human as possible.

I don't believe that we've ever gotten evidence of somebody's weight[^3] before.  Maybe notably to someone, that would put Data in the range of a *slightly* overweight man standing six foot, three inches tall, by United States Army standards, and right at the upper end of the range on the Marine Corps charts.  I can't find any reference to Data's height, and the performer's height probably doesn't matter since you might have noticed---probably most prominently and famously with Riker casually stepping over chairs to sit down---that they've scaled down the props and sets to give the characters more of a physical presence.  But either way, it seems vaguely interesting that a mechanical creature has a weight comparable to its organic equivalent.

[^3]:  The science student in me recoils at calling kilograms a measure of "weight," but I also can't imagine that the rest of the world has driver's licenses that describe your "mass."

In a deleted bit, by the way, she goes on to talk about Soong trying to simulate hiccups, which makes sense to cut because *yawn*, but it also reflects the inane sequence in [*Datalore*]({% post_url 2022-08-11-datalore %}) where Data worries that he can't sneeze correctly like a teenager plotting to get out of a test at school.

 > **JULIANA**: Because of my mother. She thought that Noonian was an eccentric scientist who was too old for me. We decided to marry secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together. We slipped away to Mavala Four and got married there. A Klingon and a Corvallan trader were our witnesses. It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd hoped for. Somehow Noonian had a way of making even the oddest things seem romantic.

Families still argue over marriages for identity-based reasons, and it pressures people to secretly marry to avoid the confrontation.

 > **DATA**: It was shortly before his death.

Soong died in [*Brothers*]({% post_url 2023-11-23-brothers %}), and what a way to tell someone about their spouse's death...

 > **DATA**: The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whether Doctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents were lost when the government was overthrown.

As far as I know, at least in our international legal system, we do indeed have a presumption of legality when somebody runs off to some foreign country to get married, though only places with legal recognition and that don't violate the law in some way, such as coercion.  Therefore, don't rush off to the nearest micronation thinking that you'll convince someone from [Morac-Songhrati-Meads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Morac-Songhrati-Meads) to marry you and [Steve King's lawnmower](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-lawnmowers-gay-marriage_n_55c2114ae4b0f7f0bebafe73?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000050), and think that it'll stick when you get home.

That at least spares you the grief of watching me try to work out what it means for a Federation member to undergo a violent---peaceful transitions wouldn't result in the destruction of government records---revolution.

I will, however, point out that some governments apparently don't make off-site backups of their records.  Although even that could happen for any reason.  In fact, as recently as January of this year, the United States saw many calls to deliberately destroy government records that the incoming Trump administration could use to identify and target people in vulnerable populations...which they have done and continue to do, so the calls did not come from alarmists.  Likewise, lawless governments often destroy records on their way out of office to minimize the risk of prosecution.  And in the case of a violent revolution, one or the other dynamic probably came into play...

 > **LAFORGE**: When you think about it, why would she want to lie? Why would anybody want to pretend to be your mother?

Right?  Think of all the boring, lifeless performances that you'd need to attend so that Data can practice "acting human"...

 > **JULIANA**: I wanted to make you female, but your father insisted on a son. We argued about it endlessly, right up until we were ready to assemble you.

Other comments that she makes feel like they exist to hint at the roots of Data's own motivations, such as the (deleted) comment about hiccups implying that Soong may have encoded his desires into Data when he couldn't create a particular behavior directly.  And here, I won't *do* it, because I doubt that I have the right background to do it justice (and can't say that I ever want to watch this show again...), but it wouldn't surprise me if the series has hinted at Data having some gender dysmorphia, and I'd love to see somebody tease that out for us.

However, in this case, I wonder if this line gestures at behind the scenes of the series.  I have mentioned before that a lot of the concept and early writing for the show comes directly from the abandoned work done for **Phase II**, which would have kicked off with [**The Motion Picture**]({% post_url 2022-03-10-tmp %}) as a two-part pilot (instead of a standalone film) and anchored the similarly aborted Paramount Network.

And as I've pointed out, in some cases, you can see clear similarities.  Picard stands in for Admiral Kirk coming back to "his" ship, with Will Decker/Riker his foil, Ilia/Troi as the foil's empathic ex, and so forth.  Anyway, when you go through a similar exercise, Data stands out as what seems like a glaring exception, because he doesn't really match Spock or his Vulcan scientist replacement from the film.  In fact, the film doesn't really have a closer analog to Data than V'Ger's *probe*, which simulated Ilia's form and personality...and had a strong interest in her predecessor's former life.

In other words, I wonder if they meant this line to nod at a prior iteration of the series, where Data started out looking suspiciously like Troi.  Speaking of whom...

 > **JULIANA**: He was worried that the sexuality program he designed for you wouldn't work.
 >
 > **DATA**: You misunderstand. Counselor Troi is a therapist.

Once again, note how this series treats its mature women:  It wants us to see them as meddlers who need to see sex in everything.

Otherwise, I'd comment about how easy Troi makes it to dismiss her actual job based on how she does it, but the two haven't even met, so this falls far further over on the "mothers don't understand" side of the fence that this era of the franchise[^4] loves to peddle.

[^4]:  When we hit **Deep Space Nine**, we'll likely need to talk about this dynamic a lot, especially when it comes to Keiko, whose personality at times will almost entirely revolve around her realizing that she has married an overgrown teenage boy who'd rather stay out late with his friends than deal with domestic life.

 > **JULIANA**: I'm just so pleased you've got good manners. It wasn't easy to strike the right balance with your programming. At first, you couldn't have cared less about the social niceties like please and thank you. You were downright rude, in fact.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Data? That's hard to picture.

Oh, I don't know, he still acts fairly rude routinely.  He almost never respects anybody's time but his own, for example.  And what politeness he has always feels performative, like when Supreme Court Justices "respectfully dissent," even though you know that the bare act of writing the first seven letters gave them an ulcer.

 > **JULIANA**: Well, the one thing we couldn't anticipate was that you didn't seem to mind about being naked. Some of the colonists objected to having an anatomically correct android running around without any clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary because you didn't suffer from the elements. We actually had to write a modesty subroutine to get you to keep your clothes on.

I find it extremely funny how an episode that focuses almost exclusively on Data, and uses this incident as an excuse to have the performer play multiple characters again, wants us to gape in shock about his early life as an exhibitionist.  And no, episode, it would not surprise me *at all*, if you had episodes where Data took off his pants and waved his full functionality around because he wanted more attention...

More relevant, though, seriously, what do these people have against nudity?  I feel like this comes up around once per season, more diligently than their anti-drug message, as if nobody has ever seen a human body before...

 > **DATA**: Thank you. I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow evening.

Speaking of needing to attend performances to boost his ego...

Also, while they'll identify this as [Handel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel), word on the street (and listening to confirm) identifies this as [*Passacaglia for Violin and Viola*](https://imslp.org/wiki/Passacaglia_for_Violin_and_Viola_%28Halvorsen,_Johan%29) by [Johan Halvorsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Halvorsen), though adapted from Handel's Passacaille (No.6) from [*Suite in G minor*](https://imslp.org/wiki/Suite_in_G_minor,_HWV_432_%28Handel,_George_Frideric%29), HWV 432.  Oh, and the title refers to an [interlude often played between dances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passacaglia) in some Spanish and Italian traditions, as long as I've gone this deep down the rabbit-hole.

Critically, though---and again, the mention of Handel comes later in the scene, and I don't bother quoting it---this seems like another case where the Federation seems comfortable misattributing authorship[^2], and/or supposed fans don't seem to actually know anything about what they claim to love.

[^2]:  It also seemed worth mentioning it, because none of the summary sites identified the piece, suggesting that my five minutes of web searches turned up something unspeakably obscure...

 > **DATA**: Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despite what happened to her, I still have that wish.

You probably all remember that we met Lal in [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %}).  More importantly, though, Data wanted and still wants a family of his own...despite relatives crawling out of the woodwork.

 > **JULIANA**: There were three of them. They were like children to us. Losing them was very painful. When Noonian decided to try again, I was very much against it. I didn't think we had the right to bring a life into the world with so little chance of surviving. But your Father was sure that he'd figured out what went wrong, insisted he could make a stable matrix, and he did. But Lore was cruel. Evil. Eventually we had no choice, we had to dismantle him. Your father decided to build yet another android, one who didn't have emotions. I couldn't believe he would want to try again.

Surely, *this* irrelevant line will never come up again, especially seeing how close we are to the end of needing to deal with this cast and how we must have completely exhausted the tired variations on this idea...

 > **JULIANA**: I lied. When I said there was no room for you in the escape pod that we took from Omicron...there was. I didn't want to bring you with us. I was afraid if we reactivated you, you'd turn out like Lore. I made Noonian leave you behind.

Yeah, back in the 1990s, you'd always see all these random kids loitering in front of the mall.  The teen topiary consisted entirely of younger siblings, abandoned by parents worried that they had spawned yet another evil seed.  Making them society's problem worked far better than any parenting.

OK, not really, but it felt worth making the point that this assertion makes absolutely no sense, especially when set against her insistence that she cared for all the random prototypes like her own biological children.

 > **DATA**: Is that because you place more value on biological life than on artificial life?

You might notice how often Data legitimately needs to ask that question.

 > **CRUSHER**: All right, Data. At first glance I see nothing wrong with her. Except for a mild case of hypertension, which is normal for a woman her age.

Note that they still dismiss [hypertension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension)...but really only in mature women.  Wikipedia indicates that "blood pressure rises with aging in societies with a western diet and lifestyle," depression, caffeine, and vitamin D deficiency, which I would *hope* that they have solved by their future.

 > **LAFORGE**: Basically she's a Soong-type android, except everything about her is designed to fool you into thinking she's human.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: She's got tear ducts, sweat glands, even veins and capillaries underneath her skin.

Early in the series, while talking about [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}), I joked that it felt suspiciously like Data's creator primarily wanted to have sex with his android(s), and making an entire **wife** seems to confirm that.  That comes in addition to that episode describing Data as "fully functional," his exhibitionist tendencies, and so forth.

Later, Soong even has an entire pre-recorded monologue boasting that her two-minute-old life recognized him as her husband, too.  Yikes...

 > **RIKER**: Does her husband know anything about this?
 >
 > **DATA**: I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasma infusion.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Probably just as well.

Did they really all advocate for concealing somebody's medical history from their spouse?

 > **DATA**: It appears to be an information module. With a holographic interface.

And did Data...mug his mother to steal this program?  Will we get a deleted scene where he rifles through her pockets looking for cash, too?

 > **SOONG**: Truth? The truth is, in every way that matters, she is Juliana Soong. I programmed her to terminate after a long life. Let her live out her days, and die believing she was human. Don't rob her of that, son. Please.

Huh.  Does Data's obsession with becoming human come from a specific design choice?  What would the truth rob her of?

Actually, now that I think about it, the way that this series has portrayed he legal regime, "that" could well refer to her civil liberties.  Even after they allegedly ruled that Data had the right to personal autonomy in [*The Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %}), Starfleet came to claim his daughter in *The Offspring*, after all, and only walked away because she shut herself down.  If word got out about his mother, I doubt that the precedent would keep them away a second time.  And maybe that explains not telling her husband, too.

Like I said about the marriage records, sometimes people take it upon themselves to destroy paper trails to protect vulnerable people, though I admit that I never thought that I might need to say that about this crew...

 > **TROI**: I know how much that means to you, Data, but at the same time, by telling her you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all your life. To be human.

By that metric, though, Data could "become human" by erasing references to his mechanical nature in his memories.  I doubt that anybody would buy that, though.

 > **JULIANA**: That's nice to know. On Atrea there is a saying, that a child born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in his heart. I guess that explains you. Take care of yourself, son.

Wait, but didn't she have an entire speech about how the androids...*didn't* all have goodness in their hearts?

## Conclusions

We get some faux-Handel, I suppose...

### The Good

Depending on how you read things, the crew *may* have conspired to hide the existence of a person with few (if any) protected civil liberties to minimize the chances of somebody discovering her.

### The Bad

Young adults feel a pressure to marry people appropriate to their identities, and those who don't conform feel like they need to escape.

The crew (and the show) continues to show disdain for older women.  Everything observation that they might make gets treated as meddling.  And they dismiss symptoms of illness as normal for their demographic.  Many appear to believe that we can automate away their social roles, too, replacing them with an interchangeable device when they die.

They similarly still have bizarre hang-ups with nudity and sexuality, suggesting an extremely strong taboo.  Also, people totally make androids for sex; I don't think that we can avoid that reading of the text.

And again, enthusiasts in a field don't appear to actually know the field particularly well, attributing works to the wrong creators.

We see concerns that many people see artificial life as inherently less valuable than organic life.  They even seem to believe that a human identity vastly outweighs the truth about origins, possibly due to the legal regime denying them of rights.

### The Weird

Despite their insistence that they care a lot about family, they always seem shocked by family showing up.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Worf tries to find a better version of this show, in *Parallels*.
