As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The result will be the acceleration of interconnected precarities, where displaced people must simultaneously navigate legal exclusion, political persecution, social stigma, and economic exploitation.

Hashtags:  #Refugees #Safety

I have to admit that I have suspected this for a while.  We have many points of intervention where we (well, our governments) could prevent the *need* for people to flee to the Global North.  But instead of withdrawing support from terrible governments, applying sanctions and (yes) tariffs for political effect, and helping countries manage natural disasters, we let them trek halfway across the world to treat them like invaders.  What else, then, would we do to those who still manage to endure all that, but exploit them...?

 > We could shift work toward ‚Äúcaring, craft, and cultural‚Äù occupations. We could focus automation, robotics, and A.I. on reducing dangerous and mind-numbing work, and on lowering the cost of strategic essentials like solar collectors and medicines. And we should resist allowing A.I. to displace people from fulfilling work.

I don't love taking yet another excuse to tell us that, really, we need to reach out and *embrace* our neighbors who have spent the last decade demonizing us.  Somehow, they never need to embrace their neighbors, even though most of them claim to adhere to a religion that demands exactly that.  But the rest of the piece, I think works...

Let's also make this plain:  Authoritarians *also* ban abortion, because they see people with a uterus as inherently weak and crave control...

Yeah, maybe don't do that.  Somebody should invent the bus.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% cw US Politics %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How City of Chicago Beat Back Stephen Miller‚Äôs Shoddy Propaganda ‚Ä¶ So Far](https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/10/16/how-city-of-chicago-beat-back-stephen-millers-shoddy-propaganda-so-far/) from emptywheel

 > It‚Äôs not clear, in this day and age, whether definitively proving that Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem and Greg Bovino and Tricia McLaughlin are just making shit up will be enough. Certainly, the right-wingers on SCOTUS have proven just as susceptible to the Fox News propaganda bubble as Trump himself.

I do have to admit that the work that Illinois has done, here, has impressed me a lot.  This and the costumed protesters in Portland have exposed the Trump administration as even weaker than anybody thought, even those of us who see this posturing as exactly that.  That doesn't make them less dangerous, but it does make it easier to convince others to stand up, particularly those who have stayed silent because they either worship or fear strength.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [One Republican Now Controls a Huge Chunk of US Election Infrastructure](https://www.wired.com/story/scott-leiendecker-dominion-liberty-votes/) from WIRED

 > News of the acquisition apparently caught Dominion customers off guard last week. Leiendecker reportedly held a [conference call](https://archive.ph/o/wSh8g/https://www.9news.com/article/news/politics/colorado-county-clerks-owner-dominion-voting-machines/73-4fdf50a0-ef1b-4bb9-a710-f4a5683b9315) on Friday with Colorado county election clerks who were angry that they‚Äôd learned of the sale from media reports instead of the company. The election clerks reportedly grilled Leiendecker about conspiracy claims about Dominion and his plans for the company. The company‚Äôs sparse new website currently only has [a brief note](https://archive.ph/o/wSh8g/https://libertyvote.com/) from Leiendecker on the home page announcing that the company is ‚Äú100% American‚Äêowned.‚Äù

Yeah, this probably won't end well.  Remember, for a lot of people on the political right, they see both cheating *and* undermining faith in elections as valid outcomes.  And all the coverage of the story plays directly into the latter by implying the former.  We need to work at shoring up elections, rather than needing to worry who owns the equipment...
