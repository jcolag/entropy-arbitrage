In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Ethics

This episode feels like somebody pitched it as comedy, and it somehow became absurdly serious, so let's wade in...

 > **WORF**: Bluffing is not one of Counselor Troi's strong suits.

Given that, in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}), Troi makes it fairly clear that she uses her empathic abilities to manipulate patients into acting healthy, and her role from the beginning revolved far more about helping Picard manipulate people than providing any sort of therapy-like service, so cheating seems rather natural.

 > **LAFORGE**: Let's just say I had a special insight into the cards. Maybe next time you should bring a deck that's not transparent to infrared light. Not to worry, Worf. I only peek after the hand is over. Still nothing. I'll get a dynoscan. We'll try again.

In other words, he cheats regularly.  Yes, I hear you as you frantically point out that he says that he doesn't cheat, but he keeps this a secret, and his dismissal suggests that he avoids looking at people while they play, not to mention the cards as the dealer picks them up, which seems to contradict what we've seen and defy all common sense.

 > **CREWWOMAN**: Look out!

I eagerly await the release of **Star Trek:  Bad Barrel**, given how much source material this episode gave us the lead up to its vicious attack.  We all saw it wiggle its way off the platform, right?

 > **CRUSHER**: I know. You can't move because one of the containers shattered seven of your vertebrae and crushed your spinal cord. I'm afraid there's no way we can repair this kind of injury.

In [*Loud As a Whisper*]({% post_url 2022-12-22-loud-as-whisper %}), Pulaski told La Forge that, despite what other doctors told him during his life, they could regrow his eyes.  They've also made an entire body for Picard in [*Lonely Among Us*]({% post_url 2022-06-30-lonely %}).  I'll get to why this might help us draw conclusions in a bit.

 > **RUSSELL**: A pleasure. I have some equipment aboard the *Potemkin*. Would you please have it sent to one of your medical labs?

The *Potemkin* last got a mention in [*Legacy*]({% post_url 2023-12-14-legacy %}).

 > **CRUSHER**: Worf is having a hard time dealing with his injuries. He's always been a difficult patient, but now. He's a little tough at first, but I'm sure you'll get to like him after you get to---
 >
 > **RUSSELL**: Doctor, I know that as a starship doctor, you have to maintain close ties with patients, but I think it would be best if I maintain a discreet distance. That way, I can give you a completely objective opinion regarding treatment.

Yeah, but she should still want to know his history, no...?

 > **RIKER**: You look pretty good for someone who's been eating sickbay food for three days.

Do patients receive lower-quality food than the rest of the crew---from the *replicators*---or did Riker recycle an ancient "hospital food" joke?

 > **RUSSELL**: Over-designed. Klingon anatomy. Twenty-three ribs, two livers, eight-chambered heart, double-lined neural pia mater. I've never seen so many unnecessary redundancies in one body.

Oh, hey, *overt* medical racism.

Now combine this with my comment above about Crusher's assessment of Worf's spine.  For Picard as mentioned, Pulaski in [*Unnatural Selection*]({% post_url 2023-01-05-unnatural-selection %}), and others, they can recreate an entire body minus any acquired damage.  La Forge, they can't fix, except that they can if the doctor reads enough journals.  And Worf has no chance at all.  Do you maybe notice something different about who they can and can't heal?

 > **RUSSELL**: Sooner or later, it has to be tried on a living patient.

It bothers me that they genuinely could have actually made this episode *about* medical racism that couldn't have accidentally gotten into the script---the doctor dismisses Worf's value in one breath and suggests using him as an experimental subject in the next, here---but they somehow don't bother.  Instead, they give us this mustache-twirling villainess willing to kill patients to vindicate her crackpot theories.

 > **RIKER**: I have always tried to keep an open mind, not to judge someone else's culture by my own, but for me to be a part of this ceremony.

I suppose that "tried" does the hard work in this sentence, because Riker seems to frequently go out of his way to judge other cultures, particularly Klingons.  [*A Matter of Honor*]({% post_url 2023-01-12-matter-honor %}), for example, made the point (for some reason) that Riker showed his superiority by ignoring Klingon military protocol.

 > **PICARD**: You or I could learn to live with that disability, but not Worf. His life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it, we don't have to understand it, but we do have to respect his beliefs.

Whoa, hold on, here.

I realize that I've made fun of Picard for his whole "your life only matters until you can no longer produce for society," but Worf's life fairly literally has *not* ended, and the good captain seems outright bloodthirsty, here.

Also, related to the paths that the episode could've taken, why does nobody mention that a friend doing all the heavy lifting in a suicide ritual actually looks a lot more like homicide?  Even if you don't want to take a stand on assisted suicide as a concept---*I* certainly don't---that seems highly relevant for deciding whether you want to personally participate.

 > **TROI**: Maybe it's time you stopped lying here worrying about your honor, and started thinking about someone else, like your son.

We see Troi harass Worf a lot more than I'd otherwise expect.

 > **CRUSHER**: You're using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to try a procedure that you couldn't do under normal circumstances. I checked with Starfleet Medical. They have turned down your request to test genetronics on humanoids three times already.

Does the civilian sector not have a medical industry?  It doesn't seem like Russell has any direct relationship with Starfleet, but she seems to get her funding through them.

 > **CRUSHER**: From leporazine? That's unusual.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: A morathial series?
 >
 > **RUSSELL**: No. I tried a new rybo-therapy I've been working with. It's called borathium. I've had some very good results.

Once again, those all seem like brand names.

 > **PICARD**: Beverly, maybe you should consider letting her go ahead with this genetronic procedure.

Yes, let's let someone run arbitrary experiments on one of the people under his protection.  He weighs this against Worf's impending suicide, but don't forget that the suicide might only happen because Picard told Riker that Worf's life didn't matter.

Crusher, at least, has some sense of her job.

 > **RIKER**: Remember Sandoval? Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. Fang-Lee? Marla Aster? Tasha Yar? How many men and women, how many friends have we watched die? I've lost count. Every one of them, every single one fought for life until the very end.

Aster died in [*The Bonding*]({% post_url 2023-06-01-bonding %}).  Yar died in [*Skin of Evil*]({% post_url 2022-10-20-skin-evil %}), and I don't know if she makes sense on the list, given that she didn't get any time to fight for her life.  It sounds like they made up Sandoval and Fang-Lee for the speech to gaslight us into thinking that they've had a more diverse cast of extras than they actually do.

 > **ALEXANDER**: We started doing multiplications today. The teacher said I'm faster than anybody else in my class.

How did we never get an episode with Alexander shouting "this times-table has no honor"?

 > **WORF**: I have come to have a great respect for you, Deanna. You have been most helpful in guiding me since Alexander's arrival. I can't imagine anyone who would be a better parent to my son. If it is too much to ask...

Maybe this explains why she pushes him so much.  If you'll pardon my jumping around in the timeline, after a multiverse incident later in the series, the two will have a brief romantic relationship that---if I remember correctly---feels much less icky than her pairing with Riker.  But maybe they've always had a relationship and the show decided not to mention it.  It would certainly explain why he assumes her best motives at the start of the episode, and she has felt free to berate him about expressing his feelings in ways that she finds acceptable, given the regressive views of gender that she has expressed over the years.

Either that, or I've had it right in considering her a terrible person, and Worf has terrible taste...

 > **RUSSELL**: Focus the drechtal beams on the anterior and posterior spinal roots.

The red gowns that everybody wears last made their appearances in [*Samaritan Snare*]({% post_url 2023-03-16-samaritan-snare %}), where I questioned the optics of dressing like that for surgery...

 > **OGAWA**: Respiration is shallow and rapid. No response in the isocortex.

You know the isocortex as the [neocortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex), more commonly.

Also, we last saw Ogawa in [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}).

 > **TROI**: No.

Crusher apparently decorated sickbay with a mural of the various *Enterprise*s in her waiting room.  That sort of pro-Starfleet cheerleading doesn't feel like her brand, so I wonder if it came down the chain of command to her office.

 > **CRUSHER**: I am delighted that Worf is going to recover. You gambled, he won. Not all of your patients are so lucky. You scare me, Doctor. You risk your patient's lives and justify it in the name of research. Genuine research takes time. Sometimes a lifetime of painstaking, detailed work in order to get any results. Not for you. You take shortcuts, right through living tissue. You put your research ahead of your patient's lives, and as far as I'm concerned that's a violation of our most sacred trust. I'm sure your work will be hailed as a stunning breakthrough. Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not sure I could.

I want to take this fairly good speech---way better than the pablum that Picard usually delivers at this point in an episode to the annoying guest star---to point out that, while the episode and crew definitely take a clear stance on medical experimentation (Just Say No), despite multiple arguments over the concept happening, the episode has absolutely nothing to say about [assisted suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide).

That seems especially odd, given that we started to hear [Jack Kevorkian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kevorkian#Career)'s name in the news around this time, because the state of Michigan dropped his high-profile murder trial because they had no laws against assisted suicide and revoked his medical license in the months leading up to when they presumably wrote this.  I can't even imagine how you write an episode called *Ethics* in late-1991 or early-1992 and not make that more prominent.

Less important, it seems surprising that the "cheating at poker" angle doesn't figure into any of this.  We now know that La Forge and Troi use their (in effect) superhuman abilities during hands of the game, which seems like it *should* fit together with an episode called *Ethics* about medical experimentation, racism, and assisted suicide.  And yet, it gets mentioned at the top of the episode and completely forgotten moments later.

## Conclusions

The episode mostly wants to focus on its one issue, so we don't get much, here.

### The Good

Crusher, as always when an episode bothers to focus on her, sees the problems in the culture and wants to fix them.

### The Bad

The crew largely seems to all cheat at poker when possible, while claiming that they only *really* secretly use their abilities to monitor the other players between games.

Medical racism seems to pervade the Federation to a point where nobody really finds it notable.  Doctors can complain about a non-human patient's anatomy or deprive people of care that we've seen work elsewhere seemingly based on phenotype.

Likewise, we have the garden variety racism against Klingons, both dismissing their culture as barbaric and trying to find excuses to declare the Klingon's life prematurely over.

And despite Crusher pushing back on the idea out of her own personal sense of ethics, the Federation doesn't seem to want to rein in doctors experimenting on patients without consent.

### The Weird

Either medical patients receive poorer food or already-old jokes about "hospital food" still pervade culture.  And we continue to see the medical field's love of brand-name drugs.

They seem to decorate sickbay with military-friendly images.

## Next

Come back next week, when the show decides that it has something important to say about the queer community...and drops its notes, in *The Outcast*.
