## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## A Fistful of Datas

The title, as you might guess, riffs on [**A Fistful of Dollars**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars).

Unrelated, in the spirit of celebrating small victories, five years ago yesterday, this project officially kicked off by digging into [*The Man Trap*]({% post_url 2020-01-09-trek-01 %}).  I notice immediately that the early posts differ by my attempts to introduce every line in addition to trying to explain it, plus quoting significantly longer exchanged instead of only the most relevant parts.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46271.5. The *Enterprise* has entered orbit of Deinonychus Seven, but our scheduled rendezvous with the supply ship *Biko* has been delayed for another forty-eight hours. In the meantime, many members of the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue their own projects, myself included.

I refuse to believe that one thousand people have *nothing to do* other than wait for a supply truck to show up.  They must have a backlog of projects, with all the science and exploration that they claim to do between episodes but never show us.

Meanwhile, best I can figure after looking at people with the name, maybe they named the supply ship after the [Filipino rice cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biko_%28food%29)?  And they seem to have named the star after a [dinosaur genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus), making the dessert-ship sound reasonable in comparison.

Hmm.  Does this episode happen because they need to wait for *snacks*?

 > **PICARD**: Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording.

I can't identify the piece, beyond (as Picard will later state) a Mozart trio.

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain we'd like your permission to take the Engineering computer offline for a couple of hours. We're working on a new interface that would allow Data to act as an emergency backup in the event of a ship-wide systems failure.

This seems ill-advised, no?  From a model-the-characters-as-teenagers perspective, it makes some story sense of we want to involve our friends in everything that we do.  But beyond that use-case, it feels more like a huge security risk, given that at least [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}) (and probably other episodes that slipped my mind) have shown that outside forces can control Data, plus---certainly not relevant to this season---they still have Lore out there, who could also use that interface.

By contrast, how often have we seen a situation where the *Enterprise* needs a backup computer?  When they have a systems failure, computers seem like the least of their concerns.

And that doesn't even touch what the experiment does in the episode.

 > **PICARD**: Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From the top.

I want to feel sorry for him (probably), but if everybody needs to clear their side-hustles with him, then he didn't bother to make it clear what people had permission to do and who to seek out while he messes around with his flute.

 > **ALEXANDER**: Deadwood. Nineteenth century Earth. The Ancient West.

They'll name-check [Deadwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota), [Bozeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman,_Montana)---which we'll visit in probably early 2026---[Rapid City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota), the [U.S. Marshals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service), and the [Winchester rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_rifle).

Also, if they renamed what we call the Old West to the "Ancient West," what do you think the original term now represents?  Given that many people don't live on Earth, it seems like the age of the era has less need of replacement, no?  Even on Earth, you kind of need to specify "the Old *American* West" because of all the people who don't live in the United States and so see different things off to their wests[^1].

[^1]:  Less relevant, especially in a show like this that conveniently erases billions of people from the future, but you'll note the similarity in problems between a term like the Old West and describing somebody or something as Oriental.  The latter refers to the East, which only makes any sense if you live in Europe or Africa.  And likewise, today, you've probably started seeing a shift away from the term Middle East---which tells you nothing except that you consider it to sit between "here" and "east"---to the far more useful West Asia.

On top of that, they only have a gap of about five hundred years, and Troi---who will show up later---*visited* the American West of this period a few weeks ago in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-21-time-s-arrow-2 %}), so does it qualify as "ancient," yet?  For context, we could use Shakespeare as an equivalent example for us, given how often the show wants to encourage us to see the Bard as the backbone of human culture.  Would you (or they, for that matter) call [**Othello**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello) ancient literature?  Even if so, keep in mind that we generally consider this "frontier" period to end in 1912, with the admission of New Mexico and Arizona into the United States, "completing" the contiguous forty-eight states.  Considering their love of the 1930s, it seems utterly bizarre for the difference between "ancient" and "current" to only span about twenty years.

Maybe they mean much earlier, since we could plausibly start the era with the earliest colonial settlements in North America?  Sure, except that they name three cities, with Deadwood and Rapid City both founded in 1876, providing us with a lower bound for when they imagine this setting.

And that doesn't even get to the question of why they'd still romanticize this era for children.  The unincorporated territories spent a lot of time adjusting their borders to work with or around the [Missouri Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise), alongside ethnic cleansing of the native population.  And you'll note that nothing like a Native American shows up in this story, not even as offensive stereotypes, which should make us wonder if the Federation even bothers to mention their existence.

 > **WORF**: I must have a little talk with Mister Barclay.

He'll take his kid to a bar and let him get into gunfights, but finds it objectionable to see a fictional sex worker in demure nineteenth century underwear from fifty feet away?  Does the [Motion Picture Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system#Criticisms) rate holodeck programs...?

 > **TROI**: He's right. You're no match for the Hollanders.

Smoking seems a bit excessive, here, no?  In the United States, smoking bans (in public places) probably wouldn't start rolling out in earnest for another couple of years, but we had definitely already started to re-learn the dangers of tobacco use, and how portrayal of smoking influenced in media influenced the behavior of children.

This gets back to the synthehol issues that we've brought up, most recently in [*Relics*]({% post_url 2024-12-12-relics %}), that they seem to encourage simulated drug use, which seems significantly worse than allowing moderate drug use, since it teaches people to not worry about the consequences.

 > **PICARD**: Computer, activate Picard Mozart trio, program one. Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro.

Data will tell us later, but so that you have the link, the music changes to Dvořák's [*Slavonic Dances*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavonic_Dances).

 > **RIKER**: Felis catus, is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature.

You presumably recognize Data's doggerel (in both senses) from [*Schisms*]({% post_url 2024-12-19-schisms %}).

 > **WORF**: I have connected the communicator's energy cell to serve as the power source.

I'd like to point out that Worf improvises a force field system in *maybe* a couple of hours, which---as with his caring for people in [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %})---goes a long way to refuting a lot of the franchise's ideas about Klingon nature.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46278.3. Both Commander Data and the ship's computer have been restored to normal operation. Our rendezvous with the supply ship *Biko* has proceeded as planned.

Wait, does he *not* want to mention how the computer almost murdered a valued member of the crew and his child, who also happens to represent a tiny minority and may have refugee status, given the family's political situation?

## Conclusions

We might get less out of this than almost any other episode...

### The Bad

We've returned to terrible security in this episode, building a system designed to allow a single officer to take complete control of the ship.

Knowledge of the American frontier seems to have become completely romanticized and sanitized for children.  This appears to have gone to an extent that they'll allow children to get into simulated shoot-outs, but worry about the possibility of seeing a woman in (modest, period-appropriate) undergarments.

And nobody seems to really care that a command-level officer and a civilian nearly died as the result of an ill-advised experiment.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we ask if electric screwdrivers can become conscious, as if we haven't already seen weirder, in *The Quality of Life*.
