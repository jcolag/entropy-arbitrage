## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Descent, part 1

As we finish out the sixth season here, **DS9** would have wrapped up its first season with *In the Hands of the Prophets*, when the local religious fundamentalists want to dictate how schools teach science, a plot that most definitely has no relevance to our modern society when...yeah, religious fundamentalists do that pretty much every day, with increasing threats of violence.

 > **HAWKING**: But then I said, in that frame of reference, the perihelion of Mercury would have precessed in the opposite direction.

They dragged actual cosmologist [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) into this.  He had [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS) (motor neurone/Lou Gehrig disease), hence the chair and artificial voice.  Perhaps of interest, he'd go on to become a bit of a crank who you might now find incongruous in a *Star Trek* setting[^1], talking about seeing philosophy as irrelevant, sounding fear-mongering alarms of potential future contact with extraterrestrials and artificial intelligence, while insisting that we consider computer viruses as a new form of life.

[^1]:  I should probably mention that the sexual misconduct allegations appear to have [come from a hoax <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-stephen-hawking-accused-misconduct/) laundered through something like a citizen journalism site.  While I don't find it implausible, nobody has located the alleged former student or found any supporting documentation of the complaint.

Not the actual scientists, but we also see holograms of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) who you might recognize as [Jim Norton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury) (not the one that came to your mind, thank goodness) and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) in the game who you might recognize as [John Neville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Neville_%28actor%29).

Oh, and so that we don't need to endure the "Data explains the joke but doesn't understand humor" bit, [Mercury's precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury) indeed presented significant problems to Newtonian physics, resolved with general relativity.

 > **NEWTON**: The bet is ten! Can't you do simple arithmetic? I don't even know why I'm here in the first place. What is the point of playing this ridiculous game?

This plays on the fiction that Einstein had trouble with math in school, based on a bad assumption of how to read his transcript.

Also, hanging a lampshade on the fact that these scenes do nothing for the episodes containing them doesn't make them more useful, writers.  Data will admit what we've always known, that these scenes burn time and give the characters extra lines, stating outright that he set this mess up to watch the simulations of scientists interact.

 > **HAWKING**: Wrong again, Albert.

Another slog of an inside joke, Hawking's work overturned a lot of relativity as established science, or limited the context where it works, depending on how you view such things.

 > **RIKER**: Stand by phasers and photon torpedoes.

It took them, what, half a second to decide that they needed to commit violence against whoever they found?  Granted, they got a distress call, but they have no idea who they'd meet *after* the attack.

 > **LAFORGE**: Captain, the alien ship is breaking orbit.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Plot an intercept course, Ensign. Fire torpedoes.

After jumping to the conclusion that they need to destroy this ship, and after it attacked them, they now don't even want it to retreat, apparently needing to kill them all.

 > **RIKER**: They were fast, aggressive, almost vicious. It was more like fighting Klingons than Borg. No offense.

It sure sounds like he *wanted* to offend...

 > **DATA**: I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotions are within my grasp. Perhaps I will experience other emotions as time goes by.

Or maybe he has had emotions all along, but everybody has insisted that it secretly meant something else.

 > **NECHAYEV**: There will be fifteen starships in this sector by the day after tomorrow. The *Gorkon* will be my flagship. You'll take command of task force three, consisting of the *Enterprise*, the *Crazy Horse* and the *Agamemnon*.

We met the admiral in [*Chain of Command*]({% post_url 2025-01-23-chain-command-1 %}).  She mentions ships named after the Klingon chancellor in [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}), the nineteenth century [Lakota war leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse), and the [Greek prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon) known for his Trojan War exploits.

 > **NECHAYEV**: Your priority is to safeguard the lives of Federation citizens, not to wrestle with your conscience. Now I want to make it clear that if you have a similar opportunity in the future, an opportunity to destroy the Borg, you are under orders to take advantage of it. Is that understood?

It would appear that Starfleet openly supports genocide.

 > **TROI**: Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist. It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it.

Again, did she get bitten by a radioactive (and competent) therapist?  After years of her half-assing this job, it consistently shocks me when she seems to actually want to treat her patients instead of spouting aphorisms.

 > **DATA**: I believe it was pleasure.

I notice that, when Data feels satisfied with killing, they want us to panic.  But when Picard or Riker does it, or when they or an admiral hates that they couldn't slaughter people, we should applaud.

 > **PICARD**: I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers! I'm sorry. He was in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortal threat, and I let him go.

You'll notice that they keep trying to pitch Picard as highly logical and diplomatic, even while he curses people out for having gaps in their knowledge and agrees that he should've committed genocide.

 > **DATA**: Geordi, the computer will require the voice authorizations of two senior officers in order to disable the safety routine. Will you help me?

Did they *finally* install guardrails on this nightmare of a rumpus room?

 > **CRUSHER**: Any last orders?

Good news, they leave Crusher in charge.  Bad news, they leave Crusher in charge *because* they bring everybody else down to the surface, and apparently consider her the least-useful in the search, so give her an abandoned ship.

 > **TROI**: This seems to be some kind of meeting place.

OK, I feel better.  She can still say useless things that everybody else figured out.

 > **PICARD**: Lore.

We last saw Lore in [*Brothers*]({% post_url 2023-11-23-brothers %}), I believe.

## Conclusions

Once again, this episode focuses mainly on its plot, and I needed to chase down references, so we don't get much.

### The Good

Troi continues to (mostly) act like a professional therapist who understands her job, in defiance of her first few years of the show.

It also may have taken them six years, but they finally realized that they need to prevent the holodeck safety systems from disabling.

### The Bad

A lot of the episode focuses on their tendency to violence.  The crew presumes an unknown but passive ship poses an immediate threat to destroy.  When that ship withdraws, they want to block its escape.  Starfleet regrets not taking genocidal action against the Borg.

We also see a fair amount of racism, though.  Everybody pats Riker on the back for propagating stereotypes about both the Borg and Klingons, because he claims to not want to offend anybody by it.  Again, they seem to think that genocide would solve their problems.  But they see Data's interest in violence as a danger to curb.

Similarly, we see the complete disrespect of Crusher, putting her in command of the ship, but only after removing its crew for more important tasks.

And they show us again that leadership comes from angry bullying, in Federation eyes.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next time, when we close out the sixth season and review what we've learned over the last few months.  Then, in two weeks, we come back to finish off this story in *Descent* part 2.
