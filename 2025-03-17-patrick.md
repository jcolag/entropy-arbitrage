Not my thing, but today marks [Saint Patrick's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day) (*Lá Fhéile Pádraig*)---which you probably already know from at least a dozen people criticizing the proportion of green that you've chosen to wear today already---commemorating his aggression in converting pagans to Christianity, for which we use the euphemism "driving out snakes."  Yeah, not my thing, but have a great one if it works for you...

With that, on to the projects.

## Notoboto

{% github jcolag/Notoboto %}

Following up on [last week's post]({% post_url 2025-03-10-tubman %}), my note-taking application has finished the document map.  As mentioned last time, some of my notes run long---yes, it must come as a huge shock that somebody who has posted over two million words on this blog in the last five years writes a lot between posts---to the point that navigating around becomes a bit of a hassle.

Writing the notes in Markdown, though, suggested a clear approach to navigation, though:  The headings indicate generally indicate where I want to go.  After all, when I scroll through, I look for them.  Therefore, the software now provides this, using a boring note that nobody cares about, but has a *ton* of headings, as an example.

![A tree-view hierarchically showing headings for my To-Do list from early October 2018](/blog/assets/notoboto-doc-map.png "I used these sorts of lists every week for about a year and a half in Boost Note before realizing that I mostly only carried the tasks over instead of taking care of them")

The map opens on a menu option and {% key CTRL %}-{% key M %} keyboard accelerator.

It takes a bit of work to get this working, though.

```Tcl
set cur 0.0
while 1 {
  set cur [.fr.pnl.notearea search -count length {*}$searchOptions -- $headPattern $cur end]
  if {$cur == ""} {
    break
  }
  set level [expr $length - 1]
  set space [.fr.pnl.notearea search -count length -- " " $cur end]
  set eol [.fr.pnl.notearea search -count length -- "\n" $space end]
  set heading [string trim [.fr.pnl.notearea get $cur $eol]]
  set heading [regsub -all "#" [string range $heading 1 end] "  "]
  set parent [lindex $hlist [expr $level - 1]]
  set item [.mapWin.fr.map insert $parent end -values [list $heading $cur] -open true]
  lset hlist $level $item
  set cur $eol
}
```

In the loop, the code searches for the next heading.  If it finds anything, it calculates the depth/level of the heading, inserts some space in front of the title---because the tool believes that staggering the collapse-arrow provides sufficient information, but doesn't---checks for the parent heading.  Then, it finally adds the heading with a hidden column that includes the position of the search match at from the start of the loop.

To use it for navigation, the code also binds a procedure to the `TreeviewSelect` event, which pulls out that hidden match position and calls `.fr.pnl.notearea see $pos`.

That works, if a bit ugly.  Allegedly, one can style the Ttk widgets, but it definitely doesn't happen the same way that we style other widgets, and this does the job well enough until I have time to look that up.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The script to extract turn the icon font CSS files into the link-annotation icons got something of an (in-progress) overhaul along the way.

First, the script now takes command-line arguments.  One defines the YAML file that maps icon names to URLs, and the other identifies the source stylesheet.

Then, the script now processes languages, as well as links.  Oh, and I noticed that the icons show on top of the code, fouling up the syntax highlighting, so they now have a lower `z-index` value in the overall style.

On top of that, the YAML mapping now has a clearer and more extensible format, at least partly so that it can support the languages.  The entries now look like this.

```YAML
buymeacoffee:
  type: link
  shadow: ld
  urls:
  - buymeacoffee.com
gnubash:
  type: language
  names:
  - bash
  - console
  - sh
```

That structure simplifies a fair amount of code, since picking out information now has explicit properties instead of fumbling around trying to identify the nature of each thing that might look like a URL.

In preparation for using other icon fonts, the script can now also assemble annotation styles without color information.

## Next

I have more changes to test for the link-annotation script, and then will need to restructure the SASS to accommodate the output of that processing, instead of copying-and-pasting everything.

After that, I may try to figure out how to style that new **Notoboto** pop-up, and should definitely get back to the Open Badges work.
