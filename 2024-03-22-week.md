As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "Some champion eye-rolling, there.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Yes, sure, they only ran a small study.  However, I'd say that it compares quite favorably to the range of studies that the "anti-woke" (pro-doze?) crowd uses to back their assertions to the contrary.  They don't even have concrete *anecdotes* of students feeling alienated when finding out about racism.  They can only project their own fears of people finding out about their racism.

While I try not to indulge the "I demand that politicians deal with the issue that I care about, in precisely the way that I want it dealt with" genre of political writing---largely because it never targets the authoritarians or bigots, and feels like some nobody screaming into the void---I actually wanted to share this, because I've seen so many liberal and progressive *voters* openly salivating about "outflanking the Republicans on immigration," without even trying to sugar-coat the bigotry and xenophobia that interest represents.

Republicans will *always* paint Democratic administrations as "weak," no matter how much danger they put innocent people in.  You can't "outflank" people who want closed borders, ethnic cleansing, and concentration camps.  We *do* all remember the concentration camps, right, in 2019, when the Trump administration rewrote the "public charge" rules and ignored Supreme Court precedent to put refugees and other migrants in open-air prisons in the desert?  Yeah, as far as Democrats ever try to go to "beat them at their own game," they'll happily move the Overton Window further right.  Biden would probably figure this out on his own, but he'll have much more trouble figuring it out, if people keep telling him to act with more cruelty in hopes of tricking the Republicans.

I don't necessarily buy Doctorow's entire argument---do I ever?---because he often frames his arguments as objecting to copyright in general, and because he seems to *desperately* want certain terms to go viral like his last big one did, but I at least appreciate him laying out the argument as he does.

It really does seem like a mistake to allow any entity to have money---let alone one that you can't throw in prison if necessary---sufficient to influence the government to exempt them from maintaining the economy that they use to get that money.

Authoritarians in a democracy can't help acting like dogs, sadly.  They'll chase cars and, if they feel sufficiently weak, might even put in enough work to prove themselves and catch one.  And then they need to figure out what to do about that situation.  And their plight will never stop making me laugh.

I've said it before, but to repeat:  Authoritarianism *doesn't work*.  It looked like it worked for thousands of years, because it didn't have much competition.  Once the Enlightenment got people talking about governing by the consent of the governed, equality, and so forth, the only authoritarian regimes left---that anybody cares about, I mean, not the likes of Hungary or North Korea---can only keep things running with a *lot* of money from the oil industry.  Without that economic advantage, the more democratic and equal country will always outperform its rivals.

The time of her degradation has passed, she is no longer the slave sold for a few coins, she is no longer the servant of, but the equal to man, his partner, by his being her natural protector, and not her lord and master.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Workers have been saying for years that in light of grinding hours, intense surveillance, and driving shifts that require them to pee in bottles, wellness initiatives like ‚ÄúSavoring‚Äù screens are unhelpful and infantilizing.

Because 404 Media appears to support [Webmentions]({% post_url 2024-03-13-indieweb-1 %}), this seems like a useful time to start integrating them into the actual blog posts.  Therefore...

Despite the entirely hypothetical money that I could have had, I laughed at cryptocurrency as far back as when I could have mined it on my home PC, and still do.  No matter the price to buy, to make money---the useful kind that people will give you things for---you still need someone willing to buy it from you with actual money.  And because of that, and that fact that it builds its entire premise on a rich-get-richer scheme, you have a space extremely friendly to scams and poor planning of all sorts.

Like 404 Media, Molly White seems to have Webmentions running, so...
