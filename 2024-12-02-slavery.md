Today, we observe the [International Day for the Abolition of Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Abolition_of_Slavery), drawing attention to and celebrating 1949's [anti-trafficking convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_Suppression_of_the_Traffic_in_Persons_and_of_the_Exploitation_of_the_Prostitution_of_Others) and a call to (like the name of the day says) end the practice of slavery.  The current estimates around fifty million victims includes employers taking the passports of migrants to pressure them into staying in construction or domestic work, forced prostitution, states using prisoners for forced labor, and forced marriages.

I should note that, while a lot of us think of this as a problem "over there," the problem spans almost the entire world.  The United States, for example, rates relatively "low" on the [Global Slavery Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Slavery_Index), but that includes [forced prison labor](https://inequality.org/research/california-moves-to-ban-forced-prison-labor/)---our Thirteenth Amendment bans slavery except as punishment for a crime---[domestic servants {% cc by-nc %}](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/beyond-trafficking-and-slavery/new-report-sheds-light-on-human-trafficking-of-domesti/), [forced marriage](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/forced-marriage), and more, meaning that the lightness of the load doesn't mean much.

On that downer of a note, on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

The blog got some styling clean-up, this week.  The section anchors---the little chain emoji next to the headings---now grow a bit on hover, to make it easier to use them.  Italicized text in quotes now gets some extra padding so that the text doesn't run together.

Most interestingly for some people, the page also now styles [text fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments).  If you have an up-to-date browser, you see, then we can link not only to identified elements, but arbitrary text, with a URL that specifies the fragment like this.

```HTML
https://example.com/page.html#:~:text=arbitrary%20text
```

For example, we can [link to the code above](#:~:text=example.com), which also highlights the target.

Then, over on the index pages, links to posts now show the tags for that post, which I hope will help clarify the relevance of posts.

The process has also started---with no idea how long it should take---of updating the SASS in general to avoid upcoming updates from declaring old features obsolete.  I built the blog's layout on Jekyll's default "minima" theme, which uses a lot of the now-deprecated features.

Finally, for disambiguation purposes, I added additional names for the footprints {% emoji human footprints %}, paw prints {% emoji animal footprints %}, and turkey {% emoji fowl %} emoji, since none of them have unique "official" names.

## Library Updates

I needed to bump library versions for [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Little Scuttlers**](https://github.com/jcolag/LittleScuttlers), my [**Mastodon Tool Trunk**](https://github.com/jcolag/tool-trunk), and [**VS Code Rat**](https://github.com/jcolag/vscode-rat).

## Next

As you might guess from this post, I have some new ideas for the blog.  Other than that, I don't know.
