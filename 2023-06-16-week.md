As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In opinion polls, college students typically express stronger support for free speech and diverse viewpoints than other groups. Partisan organizations often cherry-pick that data to make it seem otherwise.

Hashtags:  #Censorship #College

This weirdly overlooks what I see as the most straightforward answer, here:  None of the speakers that student groups protest---an important form of free speech, by the way---have anything novel to say.

It doesn't take *freedom* to spread hate against transgender people, for example, because those ideas have such a long and repulsive history that we've already heard them, and most of the asserted "facts" of the case have found themselves proven wrong.  If I gave a talk about the scientific importance of the [four (or five) classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element) or the [four humors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism), students would probably protest that, as well, at least under certain conditions where it might put someone's life in danger.

 > Sanchamaya was forced to beg money from the community members to take care of her children‚Äôs needs. She eventually migrated to the Middle East to be a domestic worker.

Hashtags:  #HumanTrafficking #NGO

I find this story particularly interesting, because of how many blatant failures occur along the way.  For anybody to care, you need to have had someone traffic you to the right places for specific reasons, otherwise it doesn't count, and counts even if you don't consider it trafficking.  But then, you also need the right story, and the right demeanor, because everybody else *also* doesn't count.  Then the funding for programs constantly proves highly unreliable and insufficient.  And the people left out at earlier stages resent the people who got anything, or could if the money still existed.  And...well, you get the idea.  Whenever we try to solve this problem, we have an ideal victim in mind, and that ideal victim needs to show up *exactly* during the narrow window of time when people can spare the attention and money to care, and either way, we end up cutting those ideal victims loose before they can manage on their own.

I've said for a while---since my [days writing on Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}), even---that the world got neoliberalism wrong.  You can't use it as an excuse to ignore problems and assume that "the market will handle it."  Rather, we need to constantly hammer the key point that authoritarianism, hate, and other destructive policies lead to worse employee performance and increasingly apathetic customers.

The arc of the moral universe bends towards justice (if you'll pardon my butchering Theodore Parker's words) not because of some magical process, but because we can get far more done together than we can apart, and we can "compound the gains" made through progressive actions than regressive action.  Or put in plainer language, good people (and organizations) out-perform bad people (and organizations), because doing good requires building relationships.

I don't give up often, but when I hit multiple conversations where at least one person seriously suggested "just" ignoring Glade (the UI layout designer) and writing code to place all the widgets, I saw no reason to continue down that path.  At that point, I might as well draw my windows by copying rectangles directly to the screen, so that I don't run into any further semi-documented surprises...

In addition to all the many other criticisms that I have of policing, I feel like it's the only area where you can pitch fake-solutions to problems that will only make the problems worse, and still maintain support, because the institution maintains white supremacy.

I had completely forgotten about Black, but this narrative makes a lot more sense than the tripe that the corporate media keeps coming up with.  It also ties to the right-wing hatred of "woke," essentially a constant admission that they most fear people realizing that right-wing talking points have no substance to them.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Places with less access to water tend to be more future-oriented. When fresh water is scarce, the thinking goes, there is more need to plan so that it doesn‚Äôt run out.

Take a moment to marvel at this, but also, keep the findings in mind when looking at fictional cultures.  We now have another tool to determine whether aspects make sense.

This presumably means that consciousness and language showed up even earlier than this.

I find social media usage fairly interesting in the abstract, and this gets fairly specific, even though I don't know how much any particular account that I see fits those categories.
