Let's talk about a handful of related, inter-woven issues.

## Announcements First

Before we get going, I have an important announcement!  In the interests of maximizing freedom of speech and creating a big tent, I have decided that I'll take any contributions to the blog.  I mean, we shouldn't alienate anybody at the expense of the blog's integrity, right?  Big.  Tent. {% emoji circus tent %}

Ads.  Hate speech.  Incoherent scribbling.  Libel.  Bring it on, everyone.

I mean, I *deliberately* create a big tent, because I want Free Culture and blogging to win.  I don't really know that I have a specific condition for winning in mind, but I definitely know that I want to side with people who have no personal integrity, believe in silly things, and might even want my friends dead for their identities.  If I didn't, then what would happen to the Marketplace of Ideas{% emoji trademark %}?

You don't want *Idea Communism*, do you?  You don't remember the 1970s, when we had pictures of villages behind the Iron Curtain, with the entire population waiting on line for one of the scarce ideas available that month.  Sure, maybe this time the government could scrounge up the [structure of DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_molecular_biology#Discovery_of_the_structure_of_DNA) for you, if you had powerful contacts in the regime, but usually you'd get some half-baked idea like a [toupee that comes from an aerosol can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray-on_hair) or [opening Al Capone's vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Al_Capone%27s_Vaults) on live television.

Imagine, waiting eight hours on line for some unelected bureaucrat to tell you about fake hair that you could confuse with foaming cheese, all because *you* let the Marketplace of Ideas{% emoji trademark %} go out of business.

Actually, because you seem so resistant, and so unwilling to take responsibility for your contributions to *Idea Communism*, I may need to start directly funding [anti-vax white supremacists who like burning down forests, kicking puppies, and suppressing information](https://az361.xyz/var/log/samba/cores/cloud/etc/pki/tls/private/list/etc/apache2/mods-available/symmetric/etc/cron.monthly/boolean/var/log/ppp/latency/var/cache/fontconfig/tag/usr/include/gssapi/sdk/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/concurrency/usr/include/bsd/library/usr/lib/sysctl.d/array/usr/share/i18n/locales/binary_tree/usr/local/share/sgml/authentication/etc/ipsec.d/private/version_control/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/foreach/botnet_agent.jar?attachment=malware&auth=bypass&cookie=inject&cookievalue=steal&dns=leak&form=bypass&headerfield=overwrite&hostname=inject&id=ba7b36f9395e28e273f9455bad1f69c901f849bdd23f3daf8a1a65f4&ip=flood&origin=bypass&password=steal&payload=%28function%28%29%7B+return+Number%28%277%27%29%3B+%7D%29%28%29%3B&portscan=spoof&proxy=relay&query=exploit&request=intercept&sessiontoken=spoof&url=manipulate&useragent=inject).  Maybe if I send them enough money, they'll also write for me so that I can have a Fair and Balanced blog in my Big Tent. {% emoji crossed fingers %} Get me some of that [5G microchip mind-control virus](https://match-heaven.club/var/lib/docker/network/cloud/etc/ipsec.d/certs/synchronous/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/profiling/opt/vmware/lib/column/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/function/etc/firewalld/ipsets/method/lib/udev/hwdb.d/heap/opt/vmware/lib/firewall/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/object/etc/gdm/custom.conf.d/constant/etc/ppp/peers/loader/var/lib/apt/lists/callback/usr/local/share/xml/firewall/usr/include/security/certificate/fake_update.exe?attachment=spoof&content=exploit&cookiejar=poison&endpoint=flood&firewall=exploit&form=spoof&header=tamper&host=inject&hostname=spoof&id=451cd9ca10787174de266117b7c446178db2468a9fb0ed17236b772b&origin=redirect&password=replay&payload=%28function%28%29%7B+const+z%3D3%3B+return+z%2B1%3B+%7D%29%28%29%3B&port=redirect&query=inject&redirect=phish&referer=inject&request=tamper&script=obfuscate&session=clone&token=exploit&url=poison&user=clone) mind-share and let's go!

Only then can we have our big tent, our Marketplace of Ideas{% emoji trademark %}, our helpful association of spammers, scammers, and fascists to make sure that everybody feels comfortable, here...

Huh.  I wonder where everybody went, and where the gigantic neon "Nazi Bar" sign came from.  You would think that people would act [more tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).

## More Seriously

OK, straight face, I *may* have presented myself dishonestly above as a rhetorical device.

{% cw Also, I probably won't bother to sift through the links for public licenses. %}

I will not, in fact, let any old person write for the blog.  Even though I still get a steady supply of [Silly Unsolicited Requests for Exposure]({% post_url 2024-02-11-sure %}) offering to inform my audience (you, I assume) about crypto-mining, side-gigs as a nursing mother, or really, anything that I can prompt them for that'll convince ChatGPT to slop out a thousand words with their by-line, because none of them seem to care about the content as long as they can ride on somebody else's traffic to goose somebody else's SEO---even though I have that *absolute wonder* of the modern world in front of me at all times---I try to keep the blog focused on...well, things that I want to write about.

Instead, I wrote the previous section to highlight the problems with the so-called Marketplace of Ideas:  Most ideas stink.  In fact, we already knew most of the current ideas stunk decades or even centuries ago.  The "Marketplace" frame currently exists entirely to keep trying to sell them to you[^dBkxRB], like some sad street vendor trying to convince you to try their [raw water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_water#Raw_water_dieting), explaining to regulators that, if the city actually enforced health laws, then they [might lose out on profits](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/stability-ai-getty-lawsuit-copyright), the poor things.  We should never talk about public housing because [we tried it once, and it didn't work](https://www.vox.com/policy/390082/public-housing-america-policy-failure-poverty), but we should always take people extremely seriously when they propose [cutting government spending](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/austerity-failure-1-chart_n_3639674) no matter how many times we've seen it fail, and no matter how many times the [alleged theoretical underpinnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt) have proven false.  We always need to take care to not ignore the fascists when we have power, but when fascists have any power, they have a mandate to silence dissent.

[^dBkxRB]:  I remember reading, but can't find the reference, that the resurrection of the "marketplace of ideas" phrase specifically came from a right-wing campaign to keep their discredited nonsense in circulation.

More to the point, though, I wanted to talk about the various debacles of companies---[Framework as the most recent](https://community.frame.work/t/framework-supporting-far-right-racists/75986), which I lightly parodied---suddenly coming out in support of open source projects that seem to delight in making people feel unsafe.  Other companies, such as [Cloudflare](https://drewdevault.com/2025/09/24/2025-09-24-Cloudflare-and-fascists.html) got on this bandwagon first, but Framework's management compounded their problem by responding to a request for clarification by saying that (in effect) they love funding all *sorts* of projects, and if some happen to have pro-genocide people behind them, that only makes open source stronger.

They specifically used the [big tent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent) metaphor, which to my might raises two separate scenarios.  And to nobody's surprise except their own, even some of their most ardent supporters find it [difficult to take them seriously](https://crimier.github.io/posts/Framework-Omarchy/).

Oh, and by the way, even while they continue to defend contributing to one project in particular, that project has quietly vanished from their official [list of sponsorships](https://frame.work/blog/framework-sponsorships).  Hyprland still sits on the list, but I gather from third-party reports (I have no interest in the project, myself) that they took the criticisms to heart and began the process of making their community far safer and continue to do that work.

## Life or Death

In some cases, you *absolutely* want a big tent, when you have survival or principle on the line.  For a purely hypothetical example that I certainly don't think about every day, if I find myself realizing that people who I care about might, at any time, need to deal with state violence and/or now illegal expulsion from the country, then I don't care who stands up with me to stop it.

Seriously, if you hate this administration because they don't go far enough, fine, welcome to the fight.  Do you oppose them because you don't like [money going to Argentina](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-trump-is-giving-argentina-a-20-billion-lifeline-to-help-its-flailing-economy) while [Alaska can't get the government to care](https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/10/14/flooded-alaska-villages-face-recovery-far-tougher-than-most-americans-will-ever-see/) about their disaster recovery, but not anything else?  Do you quietly [support abortion](https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-legal-abortion-remains-strong/) despite everybody (incorrectly) insisting that people like you constitute some tiny minority to ignore?  We can fight out all those differences later.  You'll make people feel unsafe, but they'll have immediate safety problems if we don't solve the problems.  But don't expect to [take a leadership role]({% post_url 2022-08-14-return %}) in the fight except among the people who agree with you on more issues.

Likewise, support for the New Deal in the 1930s [sparked a massive coalition](https://factmyth.com/the-new-deal-coalition-and-conservative-coalition/), including people who wouldn't otherwise cooperate.  It quickly grew strong enough that wealthy people tried to [overthrow the United States government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot), and that failed coup probably spurred stronger unity.

Yes, cases like those warrant a big tent, because you have a narrow goal.

## Community

By contrast, in most cases---such as Free Culture, Free Software, and so forth---you don't have a "goal."  Instead, you have a *community* to build.

And yes, it often makes a lot of sense to want everybody to feel comfortable in a community, too, even people who we fundamentally disagree with.  For example, I don't agree with the process that convinced so many developers to provide free labor to corporations, and I think it (deliberately) failed by abandoning principles, but I do understand the [open source rebranding and push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement), because sure, Free Software couldn't expand without getting toe-holds in the industry.

Plus, people can, after all, change, and we want to give even (especially?) the worst people the space and support to do so.  I've mentioned a few times before that I spent an unfortunate long while sympathetic to far-right causes---convinced that conspiracy theorists make some solid points, that I couldn't see any difference between Democrats and Republicans, and that straight white men can't catch a break, even while I had more opportunities than my equally (or more) talented female and non-white colleagues---so I know the value of letting people see better behavior modeled and given chances to follow.  As I've said since almost the start of the blog, [we are what we do]({% post_url 2020-03-08-are-do %}), and so we change ourselves all the time by changing what we do.

However, it only makes sense to let those people in **if** they can act in good faith, and if they show any interest in behaving respectfully.  Why?  If you don't keep them in line or prepare to expel them, then you drive away people who feel threatened by the tolerance (which does imply endorsement) of bad behavior, disgust at the acceptance of bad behavior, or both.  As I have said many times over the years, the Paradox of Tolerance warns us not to tolerate intolerance because it corrodes the community; it does not announce a clever loophole to smuggle intolerance into your big tent.

And true, some people seem to [act so deliberately hurtful](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/dhh-is-way-worse-than-i-thought/) that it would make perfect sense to refuse access until you see [some signs of good faith]({% post_url 2022-07-24-redemption %}) that can convince you of a change in attitude.  You can welcome everybody, but still deny entry to people who won't play well with others.  You don't casually let [Heinrich Kramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kramer) sit down to lunch with the coven, if you catch my drift, at least not until he proves that he can avoid trying to exterminate everybody else at the table.

## Everything in Moderation

This brings us to the M-word.  I actually don't like the term "moderation," because we don't necessarily want to *moderate* anything.

Really, we want to *cultivate* our communities, help them grow, but only in healthy ways.  We want the most useful individuals to take root and influence everybody else, and weed out the disruptive influences.  But I'll continue to use the more common term for the work, because people landing at a random spot on the post will have trouble following calls to "cultivate."

Long-time readers might recall that I left the [Scuttlebutt social network]({% post_url 2020-01-25-scuttlebutt %}) largely over this sort of issue.  While I liked many of the people there and see value in the technology[^br_7o9], the most privileged among them saw moderation practices and tools as inherently opposed to and destructive of the network, and that people should "just" block disruptive people and---ideally, in their eyes---block the public spaces entirely and eventually only communicate among known acquaintances.

[^br_7o9]:  As a quick example, if you monitor polling sites for voter intimidation by disfavored parties looking to goose their numbers, an offline-first network that transfers information when you can get back on the Internet or physically connect with a colleague who you trust seems perfect.

As I pointed out, though, that creates a [tale of two cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities), you might say.

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

For the network's "aristocrats," the people who founded the network and develop the software, the network provides a utopia, a social network where you can only find people who you care about.  But to the digital proletariat, they only see the garbage.  If they have no bread, then they can eat cake[^P2KBBy].  Because newcomers don't have any moderation in place to protect them, they get inundated with spam, phishing links, and hate speech, and the network never gets better, because the aforementioned aristocrats have also conveniently insulated themselves from the people complaining.  And so the newcomers leave immediately, leaving the aristocracy to wonder why their brilliant network hasn't caught on.

[^P2KBBy]:  Because I guess certain people have some contractual obligation to appear from the ether whenever somebody uses the phrase, let me save you the trouble:  The dismissal of peasant concerns "let them eat cake" appeared in satirical literature at least a full century before the French Revolution, so Marie Antoinette at least didn't coin the phrase.  And the fact that she (through her influence on Louis XVI) materially supported the American Revolution and began instituting constitutional limits on the monarchy, so while they resisted abolishing the crown, she *probably* didn't naÃ¯vely or callously dismiss popular concerns.  Also, you'll notice that I didn't even cite her as the source of the phrase, so quit your presumed pedantic whining.

Technically, I *specifically* left the network when one of the older computer crashes turned up that my backed-up network key somehow didn't survive the restoration, but I had already started distancing myself from the community after I proposed a way to at least [recommend people to block]({% post_url 2020-04-25-distribmod %}), so that new users wouldn't need to endure floods of trash, and they found the premise objectionable.

You see this repeated in a different way with the recent [Bluesky meltdown](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/waffles-eat-bluesky/)[^FPS0f9].  Everybody said that they wanted "like Twitter from a few years ago," but somehow didn't realize that would involve an inability to protect the community from right-wing extremists while aggressively [banning users to criticize right-wing darlings](https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/08/25/bluesky-trans-criticism-jk-rowling/), and otherwise reproducing Twitter's evolution.  Go figure.

[^FPS0f9]:  Relevant to the post, I should mention that, if I remember correctly, I had some brief and polite exchanges with Bluesky's CEO Jay Graber...on Scuttlebutt, as it turns out, so the fact that she doesn't understand moderation doesn't surprise me at all.  And the fact that a distributed protocol developed at Twitter turns out to still have centralized control, as if a deliberate attempt at [embrace, extend, and extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) against the Fediverse surprises me even less...

And sure, the AT Protocol decentralizes the service, so those banned users can migrate their accounts to another...oh, wait, [they can't](https://www.webpronews.com/blueskys-banning-backlash-reveals-flaws-in-decentralized-model/) move accounts to another service as promised?  How convenient for Bluesky to hold all the power in their federated network.  Regardless, though, they only know how to moderate one way, especially as the Trump administration settles in with attacks and disinformation.

No wonder [Free Our Feeds](https://freeourfeeds.com/) scaled back to "only" needing half a million bucks, some of which has gone to funding far cheaper projects that sound exactly like what they envisioned, and then went silent.

## Seeding, Too

Since mentioning Free Our Feeds brings us back to the idea of throwing money at allied projects, and so Framework's "big tent," I also feel the need to make another distinction, here, the difference between all this talk about communities and what Framework {% emoji poop %} stepped in.

In politics, you have a goal, and in extreme cases, you take whatever allies that you can scrounge up, with the expectation that both sides use each other and should discard each other and go back to fighting once the current fight completes.  In communities, you have the goal of healthy growth that supports the members of the community.  But *funding* outside communities?

Bluntly, you don't erect a big tent by pushing resources to little tents that want to tear down other little tents.  Such donations show priorities, that they see a modification of [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) that makes some stereotypical "hacker" choices as critical to the future, but not (for example) [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), which exists entirely to bring more and a wider variety of people into the space.  Which of those two projects sounds big tent-y-er to you?  And which sounds like it would make your donation go further?

That goes beyond moderation, beyond cultivation, to---like Bluesky's choice of targets to ban and who to loudly defend with their insipid battle cries based on fried quick breads---announcing values.  And like every reactionary, they [need everybody to see them as normal]({% post_url 2024-09-01-weird %}), so they claim to not want to get dragged into politics...from their [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair)-forward company...ignoring the fact that [making things always involves politics]({% post_url 2020-10-18-stories %}).

## The Upshot

Why do I care?

As those of you who read [the newsletter](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) probably already know, in addition to using my mini-servers to lighten the load after my more recent computer disaster, I landed on an old, refurbished Framework laptop chassis that I have used for the last couple of months with few (though not no) problems.  And I find it difficult to recommend a product by a company whose leadership gives support to a project centered on a person[^6uH5mV] who considers modern London disgusting because you now need to endure seeing non-white people because he believes in and fears [Great Replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory) conspiracy nonsense.

[^6uH5mV]:  Otherwise known as supporting the person, but I realize that his fellow right-wing weirdos love to split exactly these sorts of hairs, insisting that Framework definitely doesn't support *him*, only the project that (coincidentally) he created that credits itself to him and points directly to his personal profile.

I don't particularly care about London, certainly no more than any other city not near me, but I do care about the [ethnic cleansing](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-proposal-for-office-of-remigration-evokes-ethnic-cleansing-critics-say/) and [general violence](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5566785/ice-dhs-immigration-tactics-more-violent) that arises in support of "protecting" communities from [demographic change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally).

And also, as you can see from the internal blog links sprinkled throughout this post, I think about these community issues a lot, so I couldn't *not* talk about these messes.
