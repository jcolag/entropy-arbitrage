## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Tapestry

For broader-franchise context, this episode would come on the heels of *Dax*, wondering whether you can hold someone responsible for crimes committed by (in effect) a prior incarnation.

 > **CRUSHER**: Tell Doctor Selar she can use ward three for the ambulatory cases, and I'll stay here.

Hey, Selar still exists.  She actually appeared in [*The Schizoid Man*]({% post_url 2022-12-29-schizoid-man %}), but got a handful of other mentions.

 > **CRUSHER**: Forty ccs inaprovaline. The activity in the isocortex is falling. Cortical stimulators. Now. Again. His respiratory system is shutting down. The levels in the isocortex are still falling. Damn. Prepare a four percent series

We got a repeat drug, previously mentioned in [*Man of the People*]({% post_url 2024-12-05-man-people %}).

 > **PICARD**: No. I am not dead, because I refuse to believe that the afterlife is run by you. The universe is not so badly designed.

I noted in [*Devil's Due*]({% post_url 2024-02-01-devil-s-due %}) that Picard seemed to have a religious belief that resembled a cartoon caricature of Christianity.  His idea that somebody or something "designed" the universe seems to reinforce that idea.

By the way---assuming that Picard doesn't remember and hallucinate the bulk of this episode on his own---as I mentioned last week, Q put in an appearance on **DS9** in *Q-Less* that didn't go entirely well for him, which might go some way towards explaining his more emotional bond with Picard, here.

 > **MAURICE**: I told you that Starfleet would bring you to a bad end, but you wouldn't listen. Now look at you. Dead before your time.

Starfleet apparently doesn't have a great reputation on Earth.

 > **Q**: Death has made you a little dim, Jean-Luc. These are the voices of all the people who have died through your actions or your inactions. Now, if you have any words of apology or regret, I believe they're all listening. They're a surly bunch, actually, so don't drag this out too long.
 >
 > **PICARD**: I've no intention of performing for your amusement.

It seems notable that Picard doesn't even really flinch at the revelation that the (many) people whose deaths that he caused have a problem with him.

 > **PICARD**: I was a different person in those days. Arrogant, undisciplined, with far too much ego and too little wisdom. I was more like you.

Yeah, *those* days...as if that doesn't describe the current Picard exactly.

 > **ZWELLER**: Come on, he's just playing for sympathy now. Look, I'm going to get something to eat and head over to the casino at Bonestell. You coming?

The town(?) presumably refers to [Chesley Bonestell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Bonestell), Californian artist known mostly for his astronomical work.  A [crater on Mars](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/814) takes its name from him, which maybe implies the location.

It seems possibly of interest that the settlement outside the base gets the kind of traffic that warrants a casino.

 > **Q**: Please. Spare me your egotistical musings on your pivotal role in history. Nothing you do here will cause the Federation to collapse or galaxies to explode. To be blunt, you're not that important.

It took almost six years for somebody (besides me) to point out Picard's inflated ego, but it finally happened...

 > **PICARD**: Starbase Earhart. We came here right after graduation to await our first deep space assignments.

Presumably, they named the base after celebrity pilot [Amelia Earhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart), important enough to so many people that even the Wikipedia page punts on the matter of her legacy to tell us that "countless tributes and memorials" take her name.

 > **PICARD**: Her name was Corlina. I'd arranged to take her out today, and then she discovered that I had already made a second date with another woman called, er, Penny, and Corlina was naturally upset.

We call people like this "creeps."  You don't get into a situation like that without lying to people, so that everybody considers themselves in a monogamous relationship.

 > **PENNY**: I come from Rigel, my last name is Muroc and I like men in uniform. I think that's enough talking.

[Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel) has gotten fairly regular mentions since [*Mudd's Women*]({% post_url 2020-02-20-trek-m-women %}), so I won't go into the naming and location, but I don't think that we've met anybody *from* that solar system prior to Penny.

 > **BATANIDES**: Very, very nice. I think you should forget about Starfleet and play dom-jot for a living.

This billiards/pinball/mini-golf game will show up more than occasionally later in the franchise, though usually in dialogue.

 > **PICARD**: I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in a rematch.
 >
 > **Q**: Picard, you cheated? Picard, I'm impressed.

Really?  He pretty much cheated on Penny and Corlina.  He routinely cheats when dealing with people, most prominently using Troi to spy on his "opponents."  They keep trying to show how much Picard has grown, but that requires ignoring most of the series to believe.

 > **ZWELLER**: It'll teach him that he can't go round cheating Starfleet officers.

They don't mind cheating at all, but draw the line at somebody cheating their people.

 > **BATANIDES**: Yes. It's very attractive. Johnny. Haven't you ever thought about us getting together?

Well, something changed about Picard over the decades.  He used to not flee when women expressed an interest in him.  For those who think that I come down too harshly on the romantic encounters in these shows, you do it like *this*, having an actual conversation about what both people want and making sure that your prospective partner feels enthusiastic about going further.  If they don't feel enthusiastic about continuing, then it feels *really* creepy to continue.

 > **BATANIDES**: I don't know. We've been friends for a long time and, and now I'm afraid we've ruined that friendship.

I don't know their intent, here, but the circumstantial evidence seems to pile up in favor of Picard having much more fun the previous night than his no-longer-a-friend.  In deleted parts of the scene, she even changes the subject when he talks about sex bringing them closer.  At best, she might count herself as one of his "conquests" that he'll lie to while he dates someone else.

And yes, it bothers me a lot that the episode went to the trouble of finally modeling a healthy approach to casual sex, only to make the protagonist feel bad about it.  Likewise, when he tries, in his new maturity, to get to know Penny, she dismisses it as not worth her trouble.  And, sure, they probably didn't *intend* to teach the audience that caring, respectful relationships end in ruin---I hope, at least---but I guarantee that plenty of the same people who copied their mannerisms from Data also learned that awful lesson from this show.

 > **NAUSICAAN 1**: They are undari. Cowards.
 >
 > **ZWELLER**: What did you say?

Does Starfleet not teach *any* restraint?  This seems like the lowest bar of insults, petty enough that they made it a recurring comedic plot point in the [*Back to the Future*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_%28franchise%29) franchise years earlier.

Oh, also, notice that the foreigner doesn't get a translation for a keyword, suggesting that they still force everybody to speak English.  Either that, or the translator decided to give everybody both words, as...a joke?  A learning experience?

 > **NAUSICAAN**: Maybe I play with her. Give her good time.

Notice that, rather than object to this on principled grounds, the Starfleet folks intercede with violence to protect a woman's honor.

 > **WORF**: You are a Lieutenant junior grade, Assistant Astrophysics officer.

Has Picard ever shown any interest or knowledge in astrophysics?  Did avoiding getting stabbed give him a sudden interest in the stars?

 > **Q**: Nothing has changed, Jean-Luc, except for you. But then again, that's what you wanted, wasn't it? To change the man you were in your youth? Well, you did it. This is the man you are today. And You should be happy. You have a real heart beating in your chest, and you get to live out the rest of your life in safety, running tests, making analyses, and carrying reports to your superiors.

Picard's shock only really sinks in on the realization that he has superior officers...

I'll skip the lines, but Picard then harasses Riker and Troi looking for a command job.  And...

 > **PICARD**: All right, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q?

At that point, only when he has realized that he can't magically become important, his alternate history stinks.  In a deleted scene before the conversation with Riker, La Forge even dismisses him when he tries to pretend to know about engineering...

 > **PICARD**: I would rather die as the man I was than live the life I just saw.

Wow, seriously?  He'd explicitly rather die violently than live a life without privilege.

## Conclusions

This episode introduces dom-jot.

### The Bad

People in the Federation don't seem to have much respect for Starfleet as an organization.  And communities may build casinos near major Starfleet installations.

A lot of this episode revolves around Picard's ego.  He dismisses the idea that he should have some responsibility to people who he allowed to die and insists that he has grown out of the arrogance of his youth.  He believes that minor changes to his personal life will have a profound impact on Federation history and spent a lot of time as a dishonest womanizer.  He helped his friend cheat at a game and convinced his friend that a one-night stand ruined their friendship.  And maybe most importantly, he outright would rather die than live as an unimportant underling.

The ego problems don't limit themselves to Picard, as we see others violently prove their "bravery," and want to dissuade people from belittling Starfleet officers.

We see more evidence of racism, suggesting that they force people from other cultures to communicate with English, so that they need to reach for the correct words as they speak.

They also seem to think that they should respond to threats to sexually assault a woman by committing violence on the woman's behalf.

### The Weird

Picard continues to show extremely silly religious views.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we confirm that **DS9** really does exist in the same continuity, and Worf and Data each head in different directions to find their fathers, in *Birthright*, part 1.
