As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Like in 2016, everybody wants to rush to find a more rational reason than this, but...no, as I've commented, too many people hesitated to vote for a Black woman.  No electoral map, excuse, or anecdotal interview changes that.

Something to file away, I guess.

 > ...you can protect schools and libraries from censorship; keep careful records of the histories that authorities are trying to erase; and tell your own truthful stories about what is happening. But it is impossible to completely eradicate government disinformation campaigns. Instead, we need to normalize the struggle against them.

Nobody wants *another* unpaid job, but yes, we don't survive this, unless we start working together and building a path forward in the new context.

Industry loves to do this, as most of you already know.  Anti-littering and recycling campaigns came from plastics manufacturers, for example, because it shifted attention away from them.

This feels like it should serve as a reminder that Republicans want to use government to bankrupt people, so that people will stop trusting government in general.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The study found that "higher-ranked pages are on average more optimized, more monetized with affiliate marketing, and they show signs of lower text quality [...]  find that only a small portion of product reviews on the web uses affiliate marketing, but the majority of all search results do."

Advertising in general corrodes media, as I've said many times before, but for review-based media, affiliate marketing feels like the absolute worst case.
