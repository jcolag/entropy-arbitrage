As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > She was taken to a hospital chosen by Sama‚Äôs in-house counselor. Once there, the counselor handled all the paperwork. Mandi claims Sama was trying to control everything and keep a lid on the rape.

Hashtags:  #Facebook #Moderation #Exploitation

Given how little Facebook does to protect vulnerable people, it does stand to reason that they'd contract out to companies that don't protect their employees.

 > By using a local, spatial measure of racial residential segregation rather than race itself, CEHI hopes to shift the conversation from using race, which is non-modifiable, as an explanatory variable‚Äîto using the experience of racial minorities as a root cause of health disparities.

Hashtags:  #Health #Lead #Segregation #Racism

I hate the "let's not make everything about race" angle, when racists *already* made everything about race by structuring systems to disadvantage people of certain races, *but* if this gets neighborhoods cleaned up...then fine.

It amazes me that more than a billion people can celebrate a holiday with it only *barely* registering in media.  Oh, well.  Maybe I'll remember for next year.

Perhaps they would have found her comments less objectionable if she had also rioted in a government facility while attacking police officers and calling for the hanging of one of their colleagues...?

I love this.  I don't have anything useful to *say* about it, but yes, if you fight an entity, then you have---by definition---accepted its existence.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1471947912.jpg|A worker in a warehouse, wearing a jacket and hard hat|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Mandatory Overtime Is Inhumane and Dangerous](https://otherwords.org/mandatory-overtime-is-inhumane-and-dangerous/) from OtherWords

 > Workers are often forced to pull multiple 18-hour days a week, especially when winter cold and flu season exacerbates the company‚Äôs intentional under-staffing.

I can tell you from personal experience that work quality drops precipitously after about eight hours.  I could never understand companies who think that this saves them money, even if that extra labor costs them nothing from payroll.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How dreams can affect your workday](https://www.futurity.org/dreams-workplace-productivity-2969942/) from Futurity

 > ...connecting the dots between dreams and reality gives rise to awe‚Äîan emotion that sparks a tendency to think about ourselves and our experiences in the grand scheme of things.

I don't know if I believe this, but it at least seems interesting.

{% cw Musk, X, and All That Entails %}

 > Musk‚Äôs interactions with toxic X users also do much to directly encourage, draw attention to and imply some degree of agreement with conspiracy theories, as well as anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic speech.

You'd almost think that, as a man who grew up affluent under Apartheid, we should believe what his actions have told us about his politics, rather than accepting his platitudes, and act accordingly.
