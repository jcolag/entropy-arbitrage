Today, various groups celebrate the [Day of the Sámi People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_National_Day), commemorating the first Sámi congress in 1917.  The Sámi people live in northern Scandinavia, and if reading up on their culture rings a vague bell for you, Disney used them as the basis of the Northuldra neighboring group in [**Frozen 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_2).

On that brief note, let's check out the week's projects.

## Badging

{% github jcolag/badging %}

As it turns out, the "quickly hack together some PNG chunks and save them" approach from last week didn't quite work.  It has a *tiny* chance of producing a valid PNG file in the end, but that seems limited to my initial test case that I trusted as ideal, rather than literally any other situation.  Therefore, the code now uses [Chunky PNG](https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png), which has let its domain lapse and hasn't had any attention in about five years, but I imagine that PNG files haven't changed much in that time.  That simplifies the code dramatically, since it no longer needs to pretend to understand PNG files.

Then, as I probably mentioned at some point, the code has started splitting organizational metadata from the badge-and-recipient metadata.  The former probably won't change much over time, whereas the latter will change with every badge issued.

While doing this, it seemed to make sense to change the input metadata format from [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) to [YAML](https://yaml.org/).  The latter has less syntax to fuss over at the expense of needing to format things correctly, but also allows the author to insert comments, which should improve the readability of examples, when they go into the repository, and also allow for pointing people to the proper tools.  The code then merges the two objects and exports them to JSON for the `openbadgecredential` metadata element in the PNG file.

However, Ruby inexplicably does strange things when parsing YAML files, doubly odd, considering that the language and data format largely grew up together, to the point that most people think of it as similar to the JSON-JavaScript relationship.  In particular, it uses a library that [panics when it finds an ambiguous date or time](https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/262), and...most dates and times read ambiguously, so we have standards that *most* parsing assume, but this doesn't.

Anyway, at the [current bottom of the linked issue](https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/262#issuecomment-2562775093), you'll find the so-called [monkey patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) that overlays the fussy library code with something that actually works, at the expense of starting the program[^1] with fifteen lines of unreadable mess that have exactly nothing to do with issuing badges.

[^1]:  It needs to go first, so that the other code can make use of it.  Argh.

## Next

Now that the code reliably adds metadata to the image in, I believe, the right spot, the focus will now move to creating *correct* metadata, based on the example in the [Open Badge specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0#png-baking).  For example, the user *probably* shouldn't need to generate the proof of validity manually, since---once the process has settled---the code can do that more reliably and quickly.

It might also make sense to check the actual image type and also handle embedding the metadata into SVG files.

Speaking of valid metadata, I also need to figure out how to validate these badges, because the online services all crash when fed an image, and the command-line validator similarly doesn't seem to work.  I wonder if this ecosystem actually exists, because I'd rather not have appointed myself its new custodian based on a whim...
