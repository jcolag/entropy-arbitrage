## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Insurrection

Since last time...well, nothing happened, because this all happened continuously on the big screen.  To refresh your memory, though, Picard suddenly grew a non-fascist conscience, while the facelift-people decided that they'd relocate the immortals forcibly.

 > **DATA**: Re-routing the transport grid to avoid detection was wise, sir. However, the transporter is rarely used after oh two hundred hours.

Wait, *that* gave him away?

Also, given where we all realize this will go, why did Riker and La Forge not change into civilian clothing?

 > **RIKER**: No uniform? No orders.

...It can't possibly work like that, can it?

 > **DATA**: I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth which could affect everyone's judgment. Except mine, of course.
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Okay, Data, what do you think we should do?
 >
 > **DATA**: Saddle up. Lock and load.

First off, how has this "rebellious instincts" thing not come up in the story, so far?  It seems like the kind of thing that somebody should have noticed by now.

In the same vein, though, since when does this crew need "environmental anomalies" to act like surly teenagers?  That often feels like their entire personalities.

Then, do we even have time to parse Data's insipid "this doesn't affect me, even though everybody can see clear evidence of its effects"?  No, we'll cut to Picard's self-satisfaction that his crew only cares about their loyalty to him.  I mean, they *claim* to care about the ethnic cleansing, but...oh.

Wait, does this "environmental anomaly" answer my questions in [the first half]({% post_url 2026-01-01-insurrection-1 %}) about why Picard suddenly cares about people?  Did this film force niceness upon them, so that we'd finally have someone to cheer for in these slogs?

 > **PICARD**: They won't begin the procedure while the planet is still inhabited. So, our job is to keep the planet inhabited. Will. Geordi. Go back and put a face on what's happening here. Make the Council see the Ba'ku. It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of a people you don't know.

Again with the strongly worded e-mail.  And how would the Federation Council "see" anything about the planet in this scenario?  I guess that Riker will attach a PowerPoint presentation to the strongly worded e-mail with his shore leave pictures, maybe, because letting a rich white guy speak for a disadvantaged minority group under assault definitely fits their vibe, especially since he slips in an ableist term.

Also, did they show up in uniform because they read the script and knew that Picard would send them back to the ship?

 > **RU'AFO**: Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules. Look in the mirror, Admiral. The Federation is old. In the past twenty-four months, they've been challenged by every major power in the Quadrant. The Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion. They all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer, because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made. Now! If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenceless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say. Need I go on?

As always, we don't know how accurately to take the assessment of a dying Federation, though it connects to the mentions of repressing separatist movements in episodes such as [*Gambit*]({% post_url 2025-06-26-gambit-part-2 %}), and we can probably take the reputation itself seriously.  More importantly, though, the Federation also has a reputation for governing primarily based on opinion polls.

 > **DATA**: I aspire to be more than I am.
 >
 > **ARTIM**: I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you anymore.
 >
 > **DATA**: Perhaps?

He says as much, season after season, so why suddenly act cagey about it as if the kid has floated an innovative idea?

And as *I* have pointed out, if you actually listen, you'll find that many people from disadvantaged backgrounds similarly put in a lot of work to minimize the chances of some creep---*probably* a white person in authority---deciding to treat them as a threat.  When you hear about Black parents having [The Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_talk_%28racism_in_the_United_States%29) about racialized over-policing, they mean almost exactly this.

 > **WORF**: Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla.
 >
 > **ANIJ**: Jak'tahla?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Roughly translated, puberty, although for a Klingon that scarcely does it justice. Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies, you let me know at once.

Well, thank *goodness* that we can still take time out of this literal meandering across the countryside to say racist things about Worf again.

 > **PICARD**: I should warn you, I've always been attracted to older women.

OK, I guess, but then why does he have at least a decade on (I believe) all his other romantic interests, and literally run in terror from the one older woman who has shown any interest in him?  Do they mean to return to the days when they wouldn't stop talking about sex, but also seemed horrified to engage in it?

 > **TROI**: And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Not that we care about such things in this day and age.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **DATA**: And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? Not that we care about...

At this point, probably to dissociate from the experience of watching this mess, I find myself trying to imagine how a bunch of professionals at a major studio got us to this point.  Presumably, somebody raised the issue that the script didn't pass the [Bechdel-Wallace test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test).  And after they looked that up, they concluded that the women couldn't talk about anything less like a man than their breasts.  After all, what feminist could ever argue with that?

And then having Data repeat the lines seconds later with no comprehension of any context or meaning gives them a comedic callback, almost like a real writer might do.

Help me...

 > **RIKER**: Yes, we do. I'll take it from here, Ensign. It's time to use the Briar Patch like Br'er Rabbit did.

While [Br'er Rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit) originates in folktales passed down through American slaves, their compatriots in the Caribbean, and their descendants, probably themselves deriving from African trickster myths, we---by which I mean "white people," here---mostly know them through their exploitation by journalist[^nFkDvw] Joel Chandler Harris and Disney's adaptation of his version, [**Song of the South**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_South).

[^nFkDvw]:  Honestly, don't get me started, here.  During the Civil War, he worked on agricultural labor camps and insisted that he came from such an underprivileged background that he had great relationships with the slaves, never seeming to consider the fact that the ability of even the lowest-class white person to make a Black person's life miserable *might* have made them more polite than they might otherwise prefer.

Does Riker have a fondness for the URFU (Uncle Remus Folkloric Universe), then?  Probably not, because as usual, the reference doesn't actually make any sense.  In the story, a furious Fox catches Rabbit, who keeps begging for any death or pain, so long as Fox doesn't throw him into the briar patch.  Finding all his plans sabotaged, Fox eventually catches on that the briar patch represents the worst case, only for Rabbit to point out that he grew up in one.  I point that out both because I like the story[^0NNxW8] *and* because that bears absolutely no resemblance to anything in this scene.

[^0NNxW8]:  And at this point, would much rather read Uncle Remus...

I assume that Riker (or the writers) meant to reference the [tar baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar-Baby), here, but Rabbit got caught in it, rather than using it, so even that doesn't really work.

 > **PERIM**: I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Remind me to lodge a protest.

That line would probably land better if they didn't go on this little excursion *specifically* to do little more than lodge a protest.

 > **LAFORGE**: Our warp core is acting like a magnet to the tear. We're pulling it like a zipper across space.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: Yeah, but there's nothing to stop them from doing it again. We're fresh out of warp cores.

If they do it again, though, then...they won't have a warp core to pull the tear "like a zipper across space," right?

 > **RIKER**: We're through running from these bastards.

Oh, it looks like they plan to treat us to yet another scene where they want us to get excited about Riker killing hundreds of people in self-defense.  You know, at some point, the body count gets high enough that even self-defense starts to look like a you-problem...

 > **DATA**: Captain, tracking the water's course may reveal another exit.

Fun fact:  The water will *definitely* reveal another exit.  The uncertainty comes from whether that exit goes anywhere that people can fit and want to spend time in, but we can't expect a character like Data to make sure that they provide a pedantic but relevant representation of the situation, right?

 > **RIKER**: Geordi, are those pockets of metreon gas?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver.

I feel like some frat-boy probably already has a claim to farting at somebody and lighting it, but what do I know?  They have *legacies* to secure by killing people.

 > **RIKER**: If it works. Computer. Access manual steering column.

Well, at least the new *Enterprise* sprung for the fifteen-buck "gaming joystick" from, I imagine, Incredible Universe's going-out-of-business sales.

 > **PICARD**: If a court-martial is the only way to let the people of the Federation know what is happening here, I welcome it.

Oh, now that he has absolutely no freedom, *now* it occurs to him that he should've gone to the people?

 > **PICARD**: The Enterprise would only fire to defend itself. Ru'afo must have ordered the attack. I can't believe he would have given that order without your consent, Admiral. I wonder which of us will be facing that court-martial.

...Both of them, right?  Dougherty got on board with ethnic cleansing, but Picard dragged the *Enterprise* halfway across the galaxy on a whim in violation of orders, interfered with an indigenous culture, then appropriated weapons to wage war.

 > **PICARD**: You brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled. Except that Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.

Well, no.  Parricide, as you might guess from the spelling, refers to killing a parent.  They have only really moved to a more violent form of ethnic cleansing, and any harm to parents would occur incidentally.

 > **PERIM**: Sensors are reading over a hundred Ba'ku on board ...and one Klingon.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Target their ventral engines and life support. Set a collision course.

What the---I guess that ramming a spaceship full of people becomes warranted if it means harassing Worf?

 > **RIKER**: The Federation Council has asked me to inform you that the Ba'ku relocation will be halted, while they conduct a top-level review.

I have to admit that "a committee will run the numbers again" doesn't exactly inspire confidence, here.

 > **RIKER**: Do you think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation it'll change the way we feel?

I have no doubt that they'll go right back to not caring about anybody.

Oh, sorry, he probably meant the mammary thing.

 > **PICARD**: I wish I could stay. But these are perilous times for the Federation. I can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything that I've spent my lifetime defending. I have to go back, if only to slow things down at the Federation Council. But I have three hundred and eighteen days of shore leave coming, and I intend to use them.

This monologue strikes me as interesting, because it accidentally gestures at my own inspiration for these posts.  As I have written before, I took on this project---initially in my notes, then getting more organized and public about it---because I saw people complaining that **Discovery** had failed to establish their version of the Federation as worth defending.  The pundits in question all saw *Star Trek* as some utopian vision of perfection.  I didn't know what I'd find, exactly, but I knew that no show had established that the characters come from a perfect world.

Yet here we have Picard explicitly referring to needing to defend his world against...*something*, "perilous times."  Does he mean people like Dougherty who---let me remind you one more time---planned to do something that Picard himself had no issues carrying out a couple of years prior?  Does he mean the attacks by the Borg, Cardassians, and Dominion that got a mention earlier?  Or should we read this as another iteration of [*Conspiracy*]({% post_url 2022-11-03-conspiracy %}), where Picard worries about some ill-defined "foreign influence" that might require murdering a bunch more admirals?

His mention of slowing down the Federation Council *hints* that he means people like Dougherty---by also quietly confirming what I suspected earlier, that the government has only paused the project so that they can find an approach that requires less public exposure---but you'll notice that he can't outright say it.  And given that his objection *probably* arises from the induced rebellious streak, and that it doesn't match up to his behavior in the decade-or-so of his life that we've endured or how we see him behave in **Picard** for that matter, the whole sentiment seems empty, a political slogan where you should apply your own meaning to it and assume that he meant the same thing.

Also, he gets almost a year's vacation?

Actually, second question, given that this place apparently regenerates people, at what point during that prospective vacation does Picard start growing a new heart inside his artificial heart...?

## Quick Commentary

I realize that I said this about [**First Contact**]({% post_url 2025-12-25-first-contact-2 %}), but *what the Hell did I watch...?*

Yes, in some ways, this feels like what I wish that they could have done for seven years of the show.  It tries to express empathy for people.  It gives us at least a moment of suggesting that maybe military rule of civilian populations doesn't work out in anybody's favor.  And it even tries to take a moral stand on a real-world issue.

And yet...

In a lot of ways, they also make it clear that this only happens---and only ever will happen this once---because of an induced adolescent distaste for authority, that they oppose Dougherty much more than they oppose ethnic cleansing, but only until the credits roll.  On top of that, it stretches scenes on endlessly with lazy jokes and endless scenes of people looking at the landscape; we have probably the shortest of the films, but it feels like I spent many hours watching the thing.

And in a lot of other ways, the story doesn't even hold together.  We never really understand what Dougherty expects to get out of this plot, other than *something* for the Federation in a society where they already have the technology to regrow most of the body.  In parallel, they never explain why the Son'a need any help with the Federation, since they seem to have all the technology and labor involved in their own thing.  Data's involvement at the start certainly doesn't make any sense.  We get a weak ending telling us that somebody needs to stop the Federation from waiting a few months and trying this again after Picard and the audience have lost interest.  It continues the "must have more testosterone" aesthetic that we saw throughout **First Contact** alongside the same hypocritical preaching about moral perfection.  And maybe most frustrating, they keep talking about making this incident public, but somehow think that they can do that behind closed doors.

Also, what insurrection does the title refer to?  As I understand it, the word describes part of a national population violently opposing a government authority.  Picard and his lackeys did commit violence, as always, but did so believing that they *supported* their government.  And they limited their actions against other government officials to strongly worded e-mails to their representatives.  Plus seven people doesn't exactly qualify.

Finally, I can't help seeing this as an extension of the show's Reagan-era politics.  Let's take Dougherty at his word, that the Federation has a plan, here, to improve the health of billions of people through this.  It seems somewhat telling, then, that this released in the final years of the Clinton administration, and while the administration followed Republicans to the right on most issues, his [position on health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) included a legal right to medical treatment and preventive services, with opposition to the program revolving around sacrificing certain people and their freedom.

In other words, in context, even with the abrupt shift to caring deeply about foreigners and their culture, this actually feels like an attempt to smuggle further authoritarian views into the culture.

## Conclusions

I almost certainly found the wrong break-point between the posts, but we still got quite a bit of information out of this.  At a bare minimum, Riker continues the trend of getting cultural references wrong.

### The Good

Starfleet, at least, allows people to roll over their vacation days.

### The Bad

Somehow, even when an external force imposes rebellious instincts on them, they use it to justify their loyalty to their leader.  It also takes that rebellion for them to finally extend some empathy to foreigners.  Even there, though, they need to center themselves in the story of oppression.

The Federation's reputation has apparently declined from saber-rattling and self-serving deceit to looking likely to collapse soon.  Its government also has a reputation for chasing opinion polls instead of acting based on principle.  The government itself, though, makes it clear that they have no objection to offenses such as ethnic cleansing, if it lets them acquire resources, and that they only really postpone their actions when exposed.

We have returned to androids not having any emotions or interior life even as they make emotional decisions and describe their emotionless situations in emotional terms.  Data also starts to acknowledge that he works at people not viewing him as a threat.  Probably related, we continue to heap abuse on Worf to underscore his role as an outsider.

They spend a lot of time insisting that they can effect changes in governance by aggressively stating their positions, but they continue to celebrate violence and completely dismissive of prospective lives lost.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we sit through a wedding and at least one secret family reunion, in the first half of **Nemesis**.
