This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) continues reading **pilogy**, from _1.100 Lalani_ to the first quarter of _pi_.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **pilogy**
 * Location:  <https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore>
 * Released:  2022 -- 2024 so far
 * License:  CC BY-SA
 * Creator:  Anthony Wang and Isabella Wang
 * Medium:  Novel
 * Length:  Approximately forty-one thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  Some deliberately misspelled coarse language, Guido van Rossum jump-scare

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## pilogy

The Codeberg repository only really tells us this.

 > The fictional misadventures of the LHWHS Computer Science Club. Check out [pilogy](https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Lore/src/branch/main/pilogy.pdf)!

It also has the following probably tongue-in-cheek blurb, though.

 > *"I read the entire thing and I'm just gonna say this is better than any other fanfiction [sic] I've read."*
 >
 > *"How high were you when you wrote this?"*
 >
 > *"Bruh."*
 >
 > *"I didn't know books could cause epileptic seizures!"*
 >
 > Oh my gosh, can you believe it? My computer is overheating so much that the DVDs I'm burning with the chemtrails are actually catching on fire. I mean, talk about dedication to the cause. Not many people can say they've actually set their DVDs on fire while burning them.
 >
 > But honestly, I'm not surprised. I mean, I am a genius after all. I always push the limits and take things to the next level. And using chemtrails to burn DVDs? Genius. Absolute genius.
 >
 > But, you know, it's not just about being smart. It's about being stylish too. And let me tell you, these flames are definitely giving my setup a certain je ne sais quoi. It's like, oh yeah, I'm burning DVDs with chemtrails and my computer is so advanced it's literally on fire. No big deal.
 >
 > So yeah, read this book! It will make you laugh! It will make you cry! It will make you try the mayonnaise-frosted pie!

That might give somebody some idea of what to expect...maybe.

## What Works Well?

The description of Ezon Muzk---chapter *1.110 Ezon*---actually provoked a laugh from me, so bravo.  A couple of other quick jokes stand out, too, so I'd call at least some of the sense of humor improved from previous installments.

Also, this feels like damning with faint praise, especially since I'll talk about it in a different context later, but...the snippets that we hear from the **Daymare** anime seem to have far tighter storytelling than the main book.  I wish that the outer story had that kind of focus, even if I find it less funny.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The metafictional character randomly capitalizing parts of dialogue seemed like a pointless nuisance.  A lot of this seems like filler, in fact, to the point that I don't know which parts fill in the gaps of what happened earlier, which want to continue the story, and which have even less relationship to the ongoing story.

Speaking of the fiction in the fiction (*pi*), the book seems far more interested in the fictional film than the book's plot, so...why do we still need to deal with the main plot?  I rather not still pretend to care about the whining characters from the first half of the book, if we have that option...

## Opportunities

The repository, again, has this to say.

 > Love writing or world-building? Help out by expanding our collection of stories! We appreciate all contributions!

There you go.

## What's Adaptable?

This section gives us an extended look at **Daymare** and JavaScript-flavored drinks.

## Coming Attractions

For the next few weeks, we'll wrap up reading **pilogy**, from “The one and only!” in *pi* to the end of the book.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the story so far?
