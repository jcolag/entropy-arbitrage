As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The McCain-Feingold Act addressed the need for disclaimers and the ‚ÄúStand by Your Ad‚Äù provision, which required candidates to personally endorse their messages in TV and radio ads.

Hashtags:  #SocialMedia #Elections #Disinformation

Honestly, *all* political ads probably undermine democracy, by allowing the wealthier candidate to get their name out with less trouble.  However, since nobody else takes that radical a stance, we need to rely on regulation.

 > With every electoral defeat from 2018 onward, the GOP has had a choice: either moderate its noxious positions in conformance with public opinion or double down. They‚Äôve consistently doubled down, which is why this country now faces Project 2025...

Surprising nobody, I imagine, Republicans already plan to immediately turn against their own allies, in the event that they gain power again.

 > Last year Missouri enacted a rule defunding libraries that carry such content. And in order to comply with a restrictive new library law in Idaho, some libraries have actually banned children and forced patrons under 30 to present an ID to enter.

Unsurprisingly, the political right hates the idea of government funding going to public organizations accessible to anybody and useful for education, among the greatest threats to their ability to scare people.

 > The violent misogyny expressed in these spaces springs directly from the far-right agenda that proposes a perceived demographic crisis in the Global North is caused by women‚Äôs sexual and reproductive liberation.

Hashtags:  #Radicalization #Incels #Misogyny

I've said this for many years, but it both comforts and intimidates me that all forms of bigotry neatly colocate with each other.  By that, I mean that, without misogyny, racism and religious hatred mostly falls apart, because controlling women invariably lands on controlling their reproduction, and a moral panic about whose baby a given woman might carry.  Likewise, without misogyny, you don't have homophobia or transphobia, which center on concerns varying from defying a presumed reproductive regime or panic about the possibility of finding "the wrong kind" of person attractive.

While certainly not the biggest story making the rounds, It won't make the world *worse* when the NSA snaps up the VTR in question and makes the talk available.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Working at weddings allowed Adamu the freedom to express his femininity. Most times, after completing his duties as a make-up artist, he would adorn himself with jewelry, apply make-up, and enthusiastically join the festivities. Each event he worked at solidified his identity as a Yan Daudu in the eyes of society.

I don't have much to say about this, given my lack of experience with almost every aspect of Adamu's story, but I appreciate having read it.
