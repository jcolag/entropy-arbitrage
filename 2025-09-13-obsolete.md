This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) watches **Obsolete**.

![A Visopod monitor displaying fluffy clouds overlaid with the animation's title in a simulated pixel font, off-white on pink, with a floppy disk in the upper-right](/blog/assets/obsolete-title.png "When we older folks recoil at the nostalgia on display, here, we need to remember that, in ten years, young adults will fondly recall the aesthetic from days of broken vibe-coded apps...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  **Obsolete**
 * Location:  <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ivonne_Castillo_and_Javier_Hern%C3%A1ndez_-_Obsolete_(2023).webm> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZkDg5Pv58>
 * Released:  2023
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Ivonne Castillo and Javier Hernández with [Virtual isopod OS Productions](https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualisopodOSProductions)
 * Medium:  Short animation
 * Length:  Approximately four minutes
 * Content Advisories:  Flashbacks to old Microsoft products, some dangerous situations

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Obsolete

The video on YouTube includes the following description.

> A short film/Music video directed by Javier Hernández and Ivonne Castillo (Graduation Project), and using the song *Les Multimedias* by Graham Kartna.
>
> Additional help in production mentions:  
> Alexandra Carrasco  
> Ximena Araya  
> José Rioseco  
> Matías Laguna  
> Patricio Escala

You might want to know that the archived version on Wikimedia Commons does *not* include the song, presumably because Kartna didn't release it under a compatible license, though I don't actually know.

As background, for those of you not already familiar with the inspiration for the film's protagonist, in the mid-1990s, Microsoft identified research indicating that people saw their computers as "social actors."  For example, when you scream at your monitor, you treat the system as having a kind of face that might respond to your emotions.  Thus, Microsoft (not the researchers) concluded, computers should have anthropomorphized faces and created [Office Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant), animated "helper" characters, most prominently Clippit the paperclip-with-eyeballs, who everybody ignored and called Clippy, instead.

Arguably, that misinterpretation of research has also led to the insistence on voice interfaces, and now the Genuine People Personalities[^1] of AI chatbots, which won't do anything that you ask, but *will* do everything that they can to keep you engaged with the conversation wasting your time.

## What Works Well?

Maybe critically, in situations like this, the film doesn't try to explain the nostalgia for "Alfix" in some universal terms.  Sammy remembers it fondly, and perhaps stands alone in that fondness.  We don't need to care about the specific terms of nostalgia, because we (should) care about Sammy caring.  In fact, the ending even undercuts many of the broader nostalgic aspects, if a fresh installation works as well as rescuing your old computer with all your lost data.

Also, I love the design, because it feels like a slightly smarter counterpart to Clippy.  We get a push-pin instead of a paperclip, sure.  But---at the risk of trying to explain somebody else's joke---the name *Alfix* hints at both the male name Alfie or Alfred and [affix](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affix), the act of attaching or fastening something to something else, as you would with a tack on a board.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

It feels like the job antics don't fit the facts of the story.  And yes, some cartoon logic applies, where the character does the thing to get to the joke.  But selling honey on the street feels like a *huge* investment, for example, between stocking inventory and getting a permit[^2] to sell food on the street.  And busing tables tends to not deviate far from minimum wage work.  In the United States, that means that Sammy has about a hundred-sixty hours of work ahead of them, after taxes.  And because edging closer to forty hours of work per week triggers laws that mandate providing benefits, Sammy probably won't get much more than thirty hours per week---assuming that they have no serious competition for shifts---putting the thousand-dollar price more than six weeks away.

[^2]:  As it turns out, my father operated a hot dog truck for decades, and I know several people who tried to follow his lead, so I know that, at least out in my part of the world, local governments zealously limit the number of peddling licenses that they'll issue in a region, making it near-impossible to get one without knowing in advance that somebody won't renew theirs, and operating without one gets you in a lot of trouble.

## Opportunities

I don't see any opportunities for involvement, other than I guess wishing the team well on their new careers, what with their graduation project released.

## What's Adaptable?

We really only get hardware and software company Visopod, and their abandoned virtual assistant Alfix 95.  Technically, we have the used computer retailer, but since it shares its name with an American magazine and (until 2018) a British chain store, I wouldn't recommend calling PC World "Free Culture."

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll listen to **Cult of the Nu Girl** (and a couple of other songs), an album by Reena Pang.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the film?
