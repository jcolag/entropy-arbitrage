I feel like I always end up talking about [Memorial Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day) at the end of May, rarely finding a more general holiday than mourning United States military personnel dying in the line of duty, and---as the news will *constantly* tell us---the "unofficial start of summer," probably because you can sell ads against beach-related stories more quickly than you can against military displays...

And with that, on we go to the projects.

## Entropy Arbitrage Newsletter

For those of you interested in such things, I'll have the next issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag) ready to go on Saturday the thirty-first.

If you have signed up [on Mailchimp](https://entropy-arbitrage.mailchimpsites.com/), I still don't quite trust the company, but you'll get the e-mail on Saturday.  If you have subscribed on Buy Me a Coffee---at the link in the previous paragraph, click the *Follow* button to the upper-right of the page; no money will change hands---you'll get it on Tuesday morning, the third of June.  Since I never publish blog posts on Tuesdays, I find that a nicer match than Saturdays.

What will you find inside?  As always, you'll find links to all the articles that I found interesting in my RSS feed or bookmarked, plus some analysis of blog traffic.  For April, I wrote a piece on the possible intentional "quality" of generative AI, provided an update on the people-search saga, discussed my media consumption skewed a bit towards Asian American Heritage Month, provided some background information on **The Light's Edge**, and floated a possible hardware project on the horizon.  If you've become a member on Buy Me a Coffee, then you have already seen previews for some of that.

## Stenotype Corner

For week-four, after a couple of [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) first lesson at twenty-four words per minute---still slow, but potentially workable---and increasing accuracy, it seemed time to move to the second lesson.  And, as expected, the new material impacted the numbers hard, the first time through at fifteen words per minute and only two-thirds accuracy, significantly worse than my first outing on the first lesson.

Again, this made some sense.  This lesson introduces the following.

- The {% key D %} and {% key Z %} keys, which require stretching the right pinky finger.
- Increased use of the ring fingers.
- Reusing certain keys for equivalent sounds, such as {% key K %}{% key O %}{% key R %}{% key S %} for *course*.
- Slightly longer words, requiring more fingers active at once.

And those combine to make words like *worlds*---left middle finger to hit the {% key W %}, left thumb hitting the {% key O %}, right pointer finger on the {% key R %}, right ring finger on the {% key L %}, and right pinky stretched to the {% key D %} and {% key Z %}---significantly more difficult than, say, *hat* or *pub*.

In any case, it took a few runs through to get used to the new mechanical bits, but by the weekend, I hit twenty-six words per minute, with accuracy (barely) over ninety percent.  It has also started to "stick" a bit, where I can now think to type almost-coherent sentences, such as, "he told her the horse can pass the course about the world."  Granted, I don't have much call to write about that, but still, I'd call that real progress, given that I didn't need to look any of it up.

Starting today or tomorrow, I'll have it randomize the words.

## Social Media

I don't know how well this will go, but at least unless I get tired of it, you can go follow me (as `@jcolag`, to nobody's surprise) on [Itter](https://www.itter.sh/).  No, really.

Admittedly, not much about it catches my interest.  Like the other upstart sites, they don't seem to care about open source.  They don't seem to have significant moderation tools beyond letting users block each other.  The "fire-hose" doesn't seem to have any conversation, unless you count some weird thing where people post their computer's specifications.  I don't have much nostalgia for bulletin boards or whatever you'd call this format.  And it doesn't seem to allow "eeting" from the `ssh` command, meaning that even the blog announcements, so it doesn't provide me an obligation that I can use to justify showing up a few times every week.

As such, maybe don't expect me to loiter there for long.  But if the space interests you, come say hi, so that I can rethink that.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage %}

The week pretty much all went to catching up on minor issues on the blog.

Most relevant, mousing over outgoing links now looks dramatically approved.  Previously, the hovering action increased the font size and tried to adjust the position to minimally alter the flow of the remaining text, which didn't really work.  Now, it uses the far-less-damaging `transform: scale(3)` CSS property, which magnifies the image in-place without affecting the region "underneath" the magnification.  Since one rule borrows from the other, or at least should, you'll also see a slightly cleaner magnification to the emoji and the heading-anchor {% emoji link %} icons that you see at the top of each section.

Also, as I mentioned during the week in my post about scraping through [Firefox tab]({% post_url 2025-05-21-firefox-tabs %}) information, the script used to post social media notifications when a blog post goes out now opens the sites that I haven't found a way to automate.  It includes the code alluded to in the Wednesday post, though a couple of things seem notable in actually opening the URLs.

```bash
if grep -q 'buymeacoffee.com' <<< "${tabs}"
then
  echo Already open!
else
  xdg-open https://www.buymeacoffee.com/app/dashboard
fi
```

First, the `grep` command might interest some people.  The `-q` option (also `--quiet` and `--silent`) prints no output but returns a zero or not, depending on whether it found the target string, which allows the shell to make a decision based on the result.  More obscure and important, though, the `<<<` operator lets us send the contents of a string to the program, meaning that we can ask if it can find the string anywhere in the tabs variable, in this case.

Second, `xdg-open`, as the help puts it "opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application."  I have trouble getting it to work with files, for some reason, but it infallibly opens URLs in the default browser, and it doesn't need to do anything else, here.

Other changes seem far less consequential.  If I link to [Red Hat](https://redhat.com), that'll get an annotation icon.  A couple of typos have gotten corrections.  The link annotation script now has a permanent home in a `_scripts` folder for the build and deployment to ignore, instead of needing to ignore each individual script.  And the Simple Icons list has gotten (I think) a full update to whatever lives in the SASS file.

## Next

Again, I have that backlog of library updates to take care of at some point, and maybe some new projects, but I don't really know.
