As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Speaking of talking out racism: [Also: ‘Alien’ and ‘Illegal Immigrant’ Banned from Official NYC Documents ](https://documentedny.com/2020/06/01/alien-and-illegal-immigrant-banned-from-official-nyc-documents/) from Documented

In a lot of circles, we're far too attached to terminology and/or avoiding talking about certain issues, and that needs to change fast to make *anything* work.

###### Oscar Wilde

This is for those of you who have been trying to digest four centuries (and a year) of racist governance in the United States.  It's overwhelming, but today makes far less sense without understanding the background of (random examples) [United States slavery pre-dating the *Mayflower*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Africans_in_Virginia), the difference between Thomas Jefferson's [views on equality](https://www.monticello.org/slavery-at-monticello/liberty-slavery) versus his [ownership of human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings), [Nat Turner's slave rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner's_slave_rebellion), [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth), the [Tulsa race massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre), [Ax Handle Saturday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax_Handle_Saturday), the [Stonewall uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots), the [Kent State massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings), and so forth, this month seems like a mystery.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1270340368593293313) [Minneapolis Police Union President: “I’ve Been Involved in Three Shootings Myself, and Not a One of Them Has Bothered Me”](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/02/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-shootings/) from The Intercept

 > ...true blame rested with city attorneys, who didn’t properly defend police officers...

 > Siegel and colleagues found that racial residential segregation was the predominant factor explaining why some cities have greater black-white racial disparities in fatal police shootings—even after controlling for a city’s crime rate, median income, racial composition of its police force, and other factors.

The "bad apples" metaphor refers to the fact that you need to be vigilant and *throw out* bad apples, before they release enough ethylene to over-ripen the other apples in a barrel.  In the case of police, the work of defending and protecting officers who don't act in the best interests of their communities inherently corrupts the entire department, to the point where the police union's president is proud of not thinking about the people he shoots.

 > Very simply, diverse personalities are to be found in the breast of each of us, and often the life of more than one superior man is nothing but the coexistence of a philosopher and a snob.

 > ...we can predict that a person from a zip code in a black or Latino community will have a lower life expectancy...

The article doesn't get into this, but creation is always a political act, because anything we create encodes our values in it.  If we don't think about what values we *want* to express in our creation---whether that's an invention or a city neighborhood---they'll be the uninterrogated values of society.  And since we know *those* are often fairly bad, working intentionally would obviously be more useful.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/jcolag/status/1271065899408084994) [Corporations Stand In Solidarity With the Communities They Exploit](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv8nv3/brave-corporations-stand-in-solidarity-with-the-communities-they-exploit) from VICE Motherboard

 > Studies of Uber’s major markets (e.g. San Francisco and New York City) consistently find a majority non-white workforce that is economically exploited by sub-minimum wages.

 > But justice, accountability, and even a basic acceptance of the truth has remained elusive on a large scale, even with video evidence.

The similarity in these stories isn't an accident.  Up until recently, capitalist economies---and the [privatization of prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison) and other systems makes police departments a part of the economy---has depended on convincing oppressed people that their oppression is good.  This can be seen everywhere from the dehumanization of slaves to justify treating them as property, to the idea that poor people need the dignity of "a hard day's work."  So of course, "in these unprecedented times" (with far too many precedents), everybody scrambles to convince protesters that they're on the right side of history, even while they refuse to liberalize their policies.

 > ...remove the incentives for candidates to post content designed solely to stimulate an algorithm.

The sites are obviously not going to do that, because the companies have a [vested interest]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %}) in having the extreme political rhetoric available.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Making Swahili visible: Identity, language and the internet](https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/02/swahili-identity-language-and-the-internet/) from Global Voices

 > Could this sharp drop be an indicator that people now favor their native languages online over English, considering that less than 15 percent of the world population speaks English as their first language?

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Team finds the biggest, oldest Maya monument](https://www.futurity.org/aguada-fenix-maya-civilization-monument-2379612/) from Futurity

 > The fact that monumental buildings existed earlier than thought and when Maya society had less social inequality makes archaeologists rethink the construction process.

The monument story is like something out of a science-fiction movie, with the scientists realizing that the landscape *is* the monument.  It happens in the Americas, occasionally.
