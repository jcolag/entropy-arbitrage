To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

There you go...

## What Works Well?

Distinct from [**acoustic (yin)**]({% post_url 2025-03-08-acoustic-yin %}), where the lyrics often felt like spoken-word poems with musical backing, those (fewer) tracks with lyrics here often feel much more like prose stories read over the instrumentation.

A lot of the music also feels...either more mainstream or more confident, I can't quite tell which.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Like the other half of this package from last week, the tracks come from a variety of sources and venues, meaning that the aforementioned production quality definitely varies.  Some sound perfectly clear, while a couple bury themselves in surprisingly loud instrumentation, crowd conversation, and muddy vocals.  Here, though, I often couldn't tell the intent, because this album has so many more instrumental tracks that "instrumental with mumbling" seems like a reasonable thing that this band might have tried.

## Opportunities

You can buy the album digitally and on CD, some occasional merchandise in addition to albums, plus their entire (digital) collection.  I don't see any attempt to cultivate a community, however.

## What's Adaptable?

While I might have read more into the lyrics than intended, or missed something important, *Tony Was Here* feels like it could stand...something.  It crossed my mind that it sounded like the plot of a detective show, but I don't think that idea actually holds up.  *Cafés in Conversation* and *After the Film Shoot* each seem to have some similar potential.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll play **Sulphur Nimbus**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
