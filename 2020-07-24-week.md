As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1285199026137124869) [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Campaign Workers Just Ratified a Union Contract](https://theintercept.com/2020/07/13/ocasio-cortez-campaign-staff-unionize/) from The Intercept

 > ...caps salaries for managers, making it so that the highest paid employee of her campaign is paid at a rate no more than three times the rate of the lowest paid full-time employee.

I'll be honest, it should be a lot harder for a politician to include unions in its platform if their own employees aren't unionized.

 > This is a world of compensation; and he who would be no slave must consent to have no slaves. Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.

###### Abraham Lincoln

 > Monguillot's colleagues refused to work after the killing, but have returned Monday with reinforced security...

Unfortunately, we're going to see a lot more of this as idiots decide that they'd rather see someone harmed than look bad in comparison to someone taking a common sense precaution.

 > Out of my own great woe / I make my little songs.

###### Heinrich Heine

## 9:01 -- Wed 22 July 2020

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1285922795231289345) [Technical interviews may pinpoint anxiety not skill](https://www.futurity.org/technical-interviews-performance-anxiety-2402992-2/) from Futurity

 > The researchers also note that the current format of technical interviews may also be used to exclude certain job candidates.

Keep in mind that understanding somebody's anxieties is *useful*, but the entire interview process is broken.

## 12:03 -- Wed 22 July 2020

[<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1285968597211389952)

 > I am always at a loss to know how much to believe of my own stories.

###### Washington Irving

## 9:02 -- Thu 23 July 2020

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1286285434704793606) [People who social distance may be more intelligent, study says](https://www.fastcompany.com/90527258/people-who-social-distance-may-be-more-intelligent-study-says) from Fast Company

 > We propose that this [failure to social distance] may be associated with the limitation in one’s mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory.

I dislike the term "smarter," here, but it does make sense that there's some simple pressure preventing the cause and effect.

 > To withdraw is not to run away, and to stay is no wise action when there is more reason to fear than to hope.

###### Miguel de Cervantes

## 9:03 -- Fri 24 July 2020

 > Even the National Rifle Association has denounced them as scammers.

It's probably interesting how often Republicans accuse progressive protesters of being paid, when most of their protests seem to be extremely artificial and limited to a few people at the top.

## 12:04 -- Fri 24 July 2020

 > Lord, it's one kind favor I'll ask of you. See that my grave is kept clean.

###### "Blind" Lemon Jefferson

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [How Jesus came to resemble a white man](https://www.fastcompany.com/90529242/how-jesus-came-to-resemble-a-white-man) from Fast Company

 > In the Renaissance, European artists began to combine the icon and the portrait, making Christ in their own likeness.

This is either one of the least important stories around or one of the most.  It's hard to tell, these days...

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Scientists Discovered a Gigantic Structure in a Hidden Zone of Space](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8vg7/scientists-discovered-a-gigantic-structure-in-a-hidden-zone-of-space) from VICE Motherboard

 > The largest known structure is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is 10 billion light years wide—equal to about a tenth of the diameter of the entire observable universe.

I don't know enough astrophysics to understand if "structure" is the right word, but even if it just means "populated system mutually affected gravitationally," that's still a big find.
