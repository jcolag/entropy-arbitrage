Today marks the hundred-and-fourth anniversary of [T端rkiye's first constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Constitution_of_1921).  While it didn't last long, it created (with amendment precluding the return of a Sultan) the modern republic.  In the United States, we also celebrate the legacy of [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day).

Do we also have [something else happening in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration), today?  Sure, but then I'd need a header image that didn't make my skin crawl, and pretend that anybody will take the "taking the oath of office" part seriously...

On that brief note, on to the projects.

## Morning Dashboard

{% github jcolag/dash %}

I have *finally* finished reformatting this code, I think, so you probably won't need to read me trying to spin that into a blog post again. {% emoji party popper %}

After finishing, though, I also slipped in a tiny addition, which adds the calculated average speed for the day (steps times step-length, divided by time registered walking) as a line graph overlaid on the number of steps.  It occurs to me that walking speed probably says a lot more about how the day went than the literal number of steps.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

In publishing recent blog posts, I started to notice useless and fairly arbitrary bits of the blog, specifically a couple of post IDs.

I checked into the plugins and, oh, I left in some debugging code, printing an ID.  Yep, maybe *that* has something to do with printing IDs, John.  I deleted the code, and the problem "magically" went away.  Shocking, I realize.

## Boring CSS

{% github jcolag/boring-css %}

I don't know if this will come to anything, but I added code to opt into styling HTML `select` elements.

```CSS
select,
::picker(select) {
  appearance: base-select;
}
```

This uses the [new pseudo-element](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/rfc-customizable-select-findings) to tie the styling of the internal, previously inaccessible parts of the element to other styles.  I'll need to read up more on how it works to make use of it, but it seemed useful enough to throw in now and let everything else catch up.

## Next

I don't have a plan for the week, but I do have a couple of possible ideas that I'll see if I can pull into shape.
