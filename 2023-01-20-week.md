As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > ...Dr. King, throughout his incredible life and career, was supported by the work of thousands of unknown and largely unsung people who made his accomplishments possible.

I sometimes wonder if institutionalized history has settled on ideas like [Great Man Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) because it mischaracterizes progress as something "they" do, as opposed to something that we do all the time.

 > The researchers also discovered that a healthy controlled blood glucose response after eating breakfast is key to waking up more effectively.

Straightforward advice for people who struggle with this sort of thing.

 > In San Francisco, the number of street-based sex workers tripled in 2018 and there was a 170% increase in human trafficking cases.

I knew that these laws caused problems, but this finally hangs numbers on those problems.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/109716241865510271) [The Tanabra have made a comeback after 100 years.

 > Their melodies capture the anguish of love, deprivation, and nostalgia, as well as Bedouin and equestrian traditions.

I wouldn't call this a critical story, but I enjoy it a lot, regardless.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/109716956812190141)

 > He who would pass his declining years with honor and comfort, should, when young, consider that he may one day become old, and remember when he is old, that he has once been young.

 > Students of color may experience racial microaggressions throughout their academic careers, beginning before college and persisting into college and university settings.

You'll notice that, as we start to realize that racism mimics violence, we have an entire political party dedicated to trying to prevent us from *talking* about it, while they try to inflict the same harms onto gender and sexual minority groups.  I doubt that happened accidentally.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Almost Everyone Who Organized the Capitol Riot Has Been Allowed Back on Twitter](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k8ybb/capital-riot-twitter-flynn-ali-alexander) from VICE News

 > Musk appears to be making some decisions on account restoration himself, and many of the Jan. 6 promoters personally have thanked Musk once their accounts were restored.

I think that I've mentioned before that I've identified Musk's likeliest goal as *discrediting* Twitter.  Much like Peter Thiel funding bogus lawsuits to bankrupt Gawker in retaliation for mentioning the then-open secret of his sexuality, Musk wants to eliminate Twitter as a space where the media can see people opposing the policies of billionaires.  He wants it to exist, but as a platform that nobody can reasonably build around.
