This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) reads *Mnemtronium*, a short story from the Wikiversity Science Fiction Challenge.

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *Mnemtronium*
 * Location:  <https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_Challenge/Mnemtronium>
 * Released:  2007
 * License:  CC BY-SA (and the GDFL)
 * Creator:  [John Schmidt](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:JWSchmidt)
 * Medium:  Short story
 * Length:  Approximately five thousand, four hundred words
 * Content Advisories:  Poor representation of psychiatric illness

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Mnemtronium

The main challenge page describes the story as follows.

> [Mnemtronium](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Mnemtronium "Mnemtronium") - set in an imagined future after [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "w:Dark matter") is fully understood. It is discovered that dark matter provides a way to account for some forms of [Extra-sensory perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-sensory_perception "w:Extra-sensory perception").

As to the overall Science Fiction Challenge, it carries the following top-level description.  The story also has a [video teaser](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/File:Imoggination.ogg).

Mind you, *I* didn't find it illuminating, but the creator might have produced it before writing.

> **Science Fiction Challenge** is a learning project for exploring the nature and boundaries of science through science fiction writing. What does it mean to say that the subject of scientific study is "[nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature)" and what does it mean to talk of the "[supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural)"?

And it also provides some background.

> The "Science Fiction Challenge" originated from discussion at [Science and the nonphysical](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Science_and_the_nonphysical) where it was suggested that scientists are unlikely to discover explanations for supernatural phenomena because they assume that such things as "[nonphysical](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Nonphysical&action=edit&redlink=1) spirit" only exist in the imagination. An alternative possibility is that scientists have low levels of interest in supernatural phenomena because past experience has shown that it is hard to make scientific progress on studies of supernatural phenomena. The "Science Fiction Challenge" calls for the creation of fictional accounts of how scientific studies might some day bring seemingly supernatural phenomena within the boundary of what can be studied and understood scientifically.

That should at least give you a broad sense of the intent.

## What Works Well?

First, in terms of the original challenge, let's start with Wikiversity hosting this bafflingly off-topic event, even once, and of the participants, one author producing five thousand words of story relevant to the challenge.  That seems worth celebrating, even if we get nothing else out of this...

I at least appreciate the small touches, such as the rude AI devices, the bizarre lack of windows, and other technology sprinkled around casually.  It doesn't all feel credible, but if you asked me five years ago if I thought that we'd find AI chatbots crammed into every tool, I would have told you that didn't sound credible, either.

And while I don't know that I *like* many of them, I do give the story credit for making the five characters who we meet seem distinct.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

I mention this as a content advisory, but it bears repeating that this...doesn't have the best approach to talking about psychiatric illnesses, specifically using its science fiction setting to suggest that some unknown-but-significant subset of problems stems from dark matter detection.  In a sense, it follows from the older tradition---also used here, in fact---of associating psychic activity with psychiatric problems, an idea that I suspect wants to make the ill an "us problem" that we need to understand and fix, but instead too often comes off as almost the opposite, implying that treatment and assistance secretly interferes with their alleged purpose.

The second part---the dinner scene---feels like a complete waste of time.  Maybe in a larger story or full novel, where it wouldn't account for much of the word count, I could roll my eyes and move on.  But at fully half the text that we have, the third part never released, we get hundreds of words of dry exposition, first explaining everybody's name and relationship, then detailing the model that the story plans to use for telepathy, interspersed with almost stereotypical skeptical comments.

## Opportunities

I somehow doubt that you'll find anything, given the age and state of the story.

## What's Adaptable?

We get five characters of some renown, the DeMoore Memory Recovery Unit, the Adynyamas---presumably a mountain range, for which I can't find any reference---the "hibaton form of dark matter," the experimental memory-enhancing/dark matter something-or-other drug tepfromedrapine, and asteroid 4239 Blaise used as a dark matter transmission facility.

## Coming Attractions

Next week, we'll read the other stories from the Wikiversity Science Fiction Challenge.  I gather that mostly, we'll have background information and setup for the proposed stories, but at least one has a detailed enough plan that somebody could probably pick it up.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about this first story?
