As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > But our study suggests that it must be a ‘good' form of physical activity, which hard physical work is not.

This is not encouraging, but it should make us feel a lot more comfortable automating those jobs away *if* we can find another way to keep the laborers housed and fed.

As much as the Trump administration claims that Biden would be some sort of giveaway to China, he supported the removal of Hong Kong's independence.  I'd just as soon skip conflicts with other countries, but if we're going to claim to care about democracy and human rights...maybe supporting their destruction is a bad thing that the incoming administration (fingers crossed) should work on.

As I wrote about in one of this blog's [first posts]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %}), if you're funding an operation with ads, you need your users addicted to feeling angry and frightened.  And the best source of those emotions, these days, is unaccountable right-wing gibberish.

This is definitely not something the area---or the country, for that matter---needs.  If detention facilities are overflowing, then our policies are putting us in a position to detain too many people and those policies need to change.

 > He says Nancy Pelosi is "the only Democrat I've ever heard of" and seems to doubt the very existence of Joe Biden...

I had a brief interaction with Rhinehart in blog comments, just as he was developing Soylent.  It convinced me to stay away from purchasing anything along those lines---I considered it potentially useful for emergencies---because he was clear that his vision was just that eating was a drain on worker productivity.  He didn't have any interest in supply chains or even studies on intermittent fasting that would have been a useful pitch, because his goal was (if I may interpret it) trimming lunch hours to the time it takes to run a blender.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Expert: Trump speaks in coded language to his base](https://www.futurity.org/donald-trump-coded-language-2462912-2/) from Futurity

 > Rather than state outright support of the historically deadly notion of "race science," Trump whipped a nearly all-white crowd into triumph by saying, "You have good genes in Minnesota." Instead of explicitly authorizing violence against Black Lives Matter protesters, he says, "When the looting starts, the shooting starts." He didn't tell white supremacist militias to take action if his re-election seems to be in jeopardy; he told them to "stand back and stand by."

To be fair, the code isn't particularly difficult to crack.
