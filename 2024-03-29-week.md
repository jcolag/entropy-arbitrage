As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The Community Eligibility Provision increases school meal participation by reducing the stigma associated with receiving free meals, eliminating the need to complete and process applications and extending access to students in households with incomes above the eligibility threshold for free meals.

I find it so impressive that we have known for *decades* that feeding students at school provides better outcomes for the students in both health and academics---making the schools look better in the process---and it costs less than trying to make sure that we only ever help the absolute neediest of students, and yet, we'll fight over the validity of such programs, because we conditioned generations of people into believing that they should never acknowledge the possibility of governments improving things.

I don't have any connection to that world, as far as I know, but even so, it exhausts me to see story after story about payment processors shutting out some already-marginalized group or other, while those same payment processors happily take a cut of abusive but somehow "respectable" transactions.  Plus, you know me, I want more independent media, actually independent and not a large studio that happens to not own a quarter of the market.  We won't *get* more independent media, if everybody who wants to sell something needs to stop and question whether their work qualifies as "adult content" or any number of other nebulous categories that these payment processors ban.

I don't really know what to do with this information, since the "connection" could plausibly mean that poor overall health leads to poor gum health, but the story warrants more attention as it evolves.

I've said it before, and I'll almost certainly say it again in the future, but corporate media has such concentrated ownership that it will always push the narrative of a more-conservative world than actually exists.  They need to, because if they don't, their owners might need to pay their taxes...

 > With few exceptions, every man of any social class, owing to an infinity of unflattering reasons for a sex that passes as strong, considers the privilege of his sex as a natural phenomenon and defends it with astonishing tenacity, calling on God, the Church, science, ethics, and existing laws, which are merely the legal sanction of the prevarication of a dominant class and sex.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Redis is no longer free software](https://lwn.net/Articles/966133/) from LWN

 > The Redis in-memory database system has [had its license changed](https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/) to either the [Redis Source Available License](https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/) or the [Server Side Public License](https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/); neither license qualifies as free software.

First, you probably already know my opinion on these sorts of license-changing stunts to claim the community of Free Software while trying to dodge competition.  {% emoji dislike %}

However, this could also quickly get interesting.  If you read through the comments, you see a second story emerge that this change in license violates the rights of several contributing developers.  Even their *fix* directly violates the terms of the BSD license, by not specifying who owns the original, underlying copyright to which code.  {% emoji popcorn %}

 > Whilst there‚Äôs no shortage of women to write about ‚Äì there can still be a shortage of reliable sources to support their inclusion.

I wanted to share this post, largely because it hits on an issue similar to what I see for a lot of the year in these posts:  When celebrating a particular history, heritage, or pride month, like Women's History month for March, I can often find many likely candidates for interesting quotes, but no recorded quotes by them.
