To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## The Aether Age Codex:  Helios

The editors describe the anthology as follows, at the start of their note.

 > Welcome to the first volume of the Aether Age Codex, which we have labeled **Helios**. Discover tales of a humanity given a single prime to the pump of progress as they stare into a sky that in a blink of History has burgeoned into life and mystery. Given the antecedents, is it any wonder that they take flight in airships, balloons, as winged hoplites, and aboard wooden rockets, even as Athenian philosophers argued over the very laws of nature?
 >
 > After careful study of the available materials, we conclude the familiar human drive to learn and to teach is as much responsible for the dramatic divergence of this history from our own, as the wondrous and strange nature of their physical world.
 >
 > During an era when our own civilizations labored in illiteracy and when major technological innovations were separated by centuries, the people of the Aether Age Codex progressed at an astonishing speed. Ideas spread across borders and seas. Science, invention, and industry proceeded at a pace only recently seen in our own world.
 >
 > Despite the spectacular circumstances and drama, these are accounts of people contending with the unknown through bravery, fear, and the entire emotional spectrum. In that sense, these windows into the Aether Age open into a world as familiar as it is unexpected.

I've heard other people describe it more tersely as "[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk), but less [WASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestants)-y."

I should note that, starting with the **Helios** posts, the Book Club plans to at least bend one of my guidelines for these posts, for I think justifiable reasons.  Normally, I try to avoid going back to the same source and involvement by the same creator, at least until we have exhausted the available authors; I want to spread the attention, not keep reminding you of the same handful of people.

However, Brandon H. Bell edited this anthology---along with Christopher Fletcher---and also edited a Free Culture anthology *periodical* at around the same time.  As such, to spread attention to more people, expect to see Bell's name come up disproportionately, as we talk about the short stories in *that* anthology at some point.

As another note, it appears that supplemental content for the book has vanished from the Internet, assuming that its creators ever released it.  The editorial remarks mention audio adaptations of some stories, possible dramatizations, and a soundtrack.  Sadly, I can't even find evidence of much of it.  An episode of the long-defunct [Outer Alliance Podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20110823215320/http://outeralliance.podbean.com/2010/12/17/outer-alliance-podcast-2/) included an excerpt of one of the later stories in the book, but I can't find the recording.  Somebody took down the book's trailer video, which apparently included music from the soundtrack.  And maybe that feels appropriate for a book that calls itself a translation of a fragmentary text that arrived from another timeline...

### Technology (and Capitalism) Note

Many of you will feel put off by the fact that you can only get the book, at least for the moment, at Amazon.  I don't blame you, because I had the same twinge when I bought it, ultimately relenting because I needed to buy something else there anyway.  As always, I won't post a copy of the book to get around this, since that would encourage people to avoid supporting the project[^1].  Some good news does exist, however.

[^1]:  I will see if I can find and contact the editors, though.  If the age and discount means that they no longer really care about monitoring sales or the money, then I'll dump my PDF somewhere.

First, a lot like [**Occupy This Novel**]({% post_url 2021-10-23-occupy1 %}), the book has no [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) on it, so once you buy it and navigate through Amazon's user interface maze to download it, you can convert the book to something sensible, like the PDF that I read from.

Second, you can borrow the book through the Internet Archive, if you absolutely refuse to engage with Amazon or spend the dollar on (so far) a fairly good book and don't know somebody who might share their copy with you.

## What Works Well?

I want to get the most mundane issue out of the way first:  These stories provide us with a fictional world that seems unique to me.  To my knowledge, nobody has anything remotely like this, with the closest equivalents that I can think of either focusing on much later world powers treating the Solar System as yet another place to subjugate new people and expand mercantile colonialism---many Victorian scientific romances, for example, along with some steampunk work---*or* aiming for much more of a traditional Tolkeinesque high fantasy universe, where outer space serves mostly as a pretext to introduce goblins and dragons to avoid having their origins on Earth.  By contrast, this sets up a history from roughly 600 -- 100 BCE, when travel beyond Earth's atmosphere became possible with only Iron Age technology.

More specifically, while I'd consider a lot of the writing flawed, and will talk about that more later, each of these three stories has at least an interesting and even compelling plot.  It makes a lot of sense to kick off the anthology with the more action-oriented *Phobos*, but *The Bounds of Set* probably deserves particular praise of this first batch, for Tawaret's intriguing back-story, and the intense thriller that she finds (or should have found) herself starring in.

I suspect that, even though it leads to some of the less-interesting excesses of the stories, we can all appreciate the research going into this.  I don't think that any of us would have much trouble imagining a version of these stories where the authors do a lot more hand-waving by using modern references and asking us to assume that those references map to something equivalent.  For example, I've seen historical fiction that referred to someplace like Egypt, with a footnote that the characters would have actually used the native name at the time, but they wanted to make their story "more approachable."  Here, characters in what we call Egypt refer to Kemet, the period-appropriate names of cities and temples, and so forth.  If you can't find Kerma on the map, then you have an opportunity to *learn*, rather than a footnote telling you to imagine something more appropriate.

Likewise, even in only a couple of stories, we have maybe more diversity than anything else that we've gone through for the Book Club, living up to the "less WASPy" reputation immediately.  We've met characters from Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East, with the Far East mentioned several times and a promise that we'll get to the Americas.  While we don't see many women, we spend time with one important woman, and get some indication of the gender politics of this world.  And two of the characters have disabilities that they deal with to varying degrees of success.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Out of three stories in this batch, it worries me that *two* of them revolve around anxiety about sibling rivalries, specifically dealing with athletic brothers.  I realize that some people really do need to face this, and it pervades mythology so much that one might feel inclined to believe that it pervaded the ancient world, too, but...it feels more like a tired trope, if we need to do this so often.

Likewise, *The Flight of the Ibis* feels somewhat arbitrary in dumping actual working magic into this seemingly otherwise-realistic (with one significant change) world.  It feels especially inappropriate, considering that the tension in the story would work exactly as well with a more mundane ending, and the author appears to have added the "twist" as a surprise.  And really, if that magic could actually work, that seems like it changes the universe much more than space travel more than two thousand years ago would.

One final recurring bit, I also feel the need to draw attention to how often these stories choose to abruptly change context without any signal.  It feels like half of *Phobos* happens in flashback, for example, sometimes repeating things that characters have already shown us, and not set apart from the main text so that we can tell the difference.  The protagonist talks to somebody, and we need to guess when it happened with respect to every other paragraph, I guess.  The other two stories don't hit this at quite an extreme, but they also have moments where I, at least, felt like I might have accidentally skipped a few pages.

## Opportunities

I sincerely doubt it, other than buying the book from Amazon.  They published the book almost fifteen years ago and never---to my knowledge, but please somebody correct me, here---tried to build a community around the concept.

## What's Adaptable?

Well, we have an entire alternate history, where conditions changed to make exploration of the Solar System possible roughly contemporary to the Roman Republic.  They tell us that the Greeks have a certain cultural dominance leading to their language and currency becoming international standards of a sort, at least until we moved away from the "breathable aether," a luminescent, multicolored cloud that tends toward blue-green and occasionally showers down meteors of strange metals.

In the stories themselves, *Phobos* gives us a mysterious monolith on the Martian---sorry, *Aresian*---moon, some characters, and two aether-navigating ships from Hellas.  *Flight of the Ibis* gives us a maybe-apocryphal (as mentioned, the mysticism seems absurdly out of place in this book) early ship and heroic figure.  And *The Bounds of Set* give us some idea of the geopolitics of the early era that gestures at something like a Cold War.

We never got the later books, as far as I know, but the *Editors' Note* tells us that they planned a trilogy of these anthologies, expanding the timeline.  **Helios** builds this first exploration of the Solar System.  **Tartaros** would have walked through the aftermath of the "Aether Age," on Gaia (Earth) and on its now-isolated colonies.  And **Cline** would have fast-forwarded to our apparent peers in this other timeline, with the Solar System once again immersed in aether, rediscovering people whose ancestors settled on planets and moons many centuries prior and lost contact with their home-world.

In addition, as mentioned, *somewhere out there*, somebody might have copies of a soundtrack, audio recordings of the stories, and possibly even dramatizations.  The editors might have mentioned that aspirationally, but if also released under Free Culture licenses, that material would give this world more depth.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll continue reading **The Aether Age Codex:  Helios** with the next two stories in the book, *Goga's First Law* and *The Heart of Carnelian*.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about these stories?
