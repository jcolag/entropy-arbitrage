As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

## 10:17 -- Mon 29 December 2025

Yes, it took me a while to get my act together, this week, but with some free time, I managed to (mostly) recover...

I only learned about [J. Marion Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marion_Sims) a few years ago.  It shouldn't have taken me that long, because however bad that you think his story will go, he will outperform your fears.  And the Trump administration lives in fear of people realizing that we live in a world built on the backs of the exploited and abused.

 > The mind alike, vigorous or weak, is capable of culture, but still bears fruit according to its nature. ’Tis not the teacher’s skill that rears the scholar: The sparkling gem gives back the glorious radiance it drinks from other light, but the dull earth absorbs the blaze, and yields no gleam again.

You know, not only does this story bring some justice to the survivors, not only does it hamstring an administration focused on undoing pluralistic democracy, not only does it force the people at fault to publicly embarrass themselves while they try to weasel out of responsibility, but it occurs to me that their delaying tactics do a fantastic job of keeping the story in the news.  It could actually make their brand of authoritarianism so toxic that nobody will touch them for a while.

Can we eventually learn the lesson that a system based on individualism and competition maybe only benefits the already-wealthy?

Funny thing, when the administration came in a year ago, I consoled some friends by pointing out that they all hate each other and---as shown in the Project 2025 document---have wildly incompatible plans for the country.  And, I said, it only takes amplifying those differences, keeping them under stress, and making them feel impotent to cause them to fight each other.  And you'll notice that has happened in waves, each wave starting with the spat between Trump and Musk getting larger.  Now we have the [Susie Wiles interview](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1), many Republicans in Congress torn between retiring at the end of the term or resigning now, the aforementioned response to the Epstein scandal keeping the scandal centered in the news, and more.

Depriving them of a majority won't solve the problem, but if we can keep up the pressure instead of once again congratulating ourselves on a job well-done while failing to pursue consequences, we can potentially right the system.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/wombats-square-poop_1600-1.jpg|A wombat|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Why do wombats have square poop?](https://www.futurity.org/why-do-wombats-have-square-poop-3315082/) from Futurity

 > Wombats are antisocial creatures, avoiding interactions with one another except for mating and rearing young. They change burrows every few days, often returning to a previous home. As nocturnal animals, their eyesight isn’t great. Yet, they poop in common areas called latrines, and their square poop stays put, rather than rolling away.

While hardly the most important story of the week, I absolutely don't have the sort of willpower required to pass it up...
