Especially over the past year or two, I have complained a lot about the broad objection-to-copyright movement.  You know the whole deal, here.  Rather than build new things off to the side and embrace the positive liberty of---as you'll often see it phrased---*creativity from constraint*, they demand the negative liberty of selling their grimdark Biskitts reboot[^da3WOz] or whatever.

[^da3WOz]:  Picture it, feral dogs who mostly only want to eat and sleep in medieval Europe, but when provoked can rip their opponents' throats out.  King Max and his minions serve as guard dogs for some estate where the wasteful family leaves out food.  By the way, it never occurred to me how many children's media properties from my youth---not that I actually read or watched **The Biskitts**---have gotten multiple reboots and revivals over the years.  It took me a *long* time to find one that nobody has bothered with, and I hope that everybody appreciates the lengths that I go to for the most irrelevant jokes...

![A handshake](/blog/assets/Hermandad-friendship.png "Put'er there")

And as I have said, I didn't always disagree with that perspective.  In fact, that belief, stemmed from the almost simultaneous signing (in the United States) of the [Copyright Term Extension Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act) and [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act), both soon after the UK retroactively extended copyright terms by twenty years, at around the same time that I started thinking about publishing by borrowing from public domain sources.  Over time, though, that has evolved into an interest in and embrace of [Free Culture]({% post_url 2025-09-21-define-free-culture-1 %}).  However, I recently stumbled across an archive of my old e-mail, which indicated that this former dislike of copyright may have accidentally pushed me away from some toxic beliefs.

## The Bad Old Days

A few times over the years, I have mentioned that I spent a lot of my early adulthood believing all sorts of bad ideas, having fallen down conspiracy theory rabbit-holes and (frankly) wanting to justify my own self-importance.  And I can see that all through these old e-mails.  Honestly, I don't even know how deeply I believed any of it, but I did express them to at least one person.  You don't need to hear that story, though, so I'll spare you the details.

Instead, I want to talk about how the dislike of modern copyright law might have helped pry me out of that line of thinking, and the maybe-useful guideline that I concocted.

## Good Law/Bad Law

Buried in one of those old e-mails, in railing against copyright, I asserted more or less this, in summary.

> Good laws enable cooperation; bad laws hinder it.

In that, I meant good or bad in the context of society.  Specifically, I saw this in terms of creating things, and considered the idea self-evident.  After all, if you have *n* existing creations, and anybody can smack any pair of them together, then you have *n<sup>2</sup>* things, and as you iterate on those combinations in terms of larger combinations and over time, you have *n!* things[^K1J0te], which benefits culture more than Disney or a hypothetical Paramount/Warner merger hoarding almost a century's worth of cultural material.  In a visceral sense, this goes directly to Newton's [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) quoting of some earlier bit.

[^K1J0te]:  Yes, often, my "computer science professor" side comes out in full force.  For those of you who haven't taken an algorithms class, you can't grow things faster than factorial growth (*n* times *n-1* times *n-1*, and so on to *1*) in terms of the input size.  In algorithms, factorial-growth time or space generally means literally trying or collecting every possible combination of options.  In the reality of creation, you probably can grow the set faster than factorial time, because each creator has the potential to invent something entirely new as well, increasing *n*.

Granted, I couldn't tell you how deeply I believed *this*, either, but it certainly resonated at the moment and passed the sort of superficial analysis that goes into arguing with people through e-mail.

## More Than Copyright

While I originally viewed this idea as an argument about copyright, the more that I let that thought sink in to actually give it some thought, the more I started to see that pattern repeated across society.  Let's walk through some examples.

### Expansion

Consider, for example, population growth.  If you look for the largest corporate employer in the world, you find Walmart, with about two-and-a-third million employees.  If you look for the oldest company (with no parent company and not a single/local facility), it looks like you find [Genda Shigyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genda_Shigy%C5%8D), founded around twelve-and-a-half centuries ago; if you want more broadly significant than artisans, too, then it looks like you find [Cambridge University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press), founded less than five centuries ago.

Cities[^i01KJP], though?  Hurrians founded [Diyarbakır](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbak%C4%B1r) around ten thousand years ago, with [Plovdiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv) probably founded around eight thousand years ago.  And in terms of people, I count twenty-seven [cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities) with populations over ten million people, topping out at [Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing) at thirty-two million residents; if we talk about the broader metropolitan areas, fifteen cities have more than *twenty* million residents, led (as you probably know) by [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) at almost thirty-eight million.

[^i01KJP]:  I should head off the natural objection that modern cities mostly stink.  Many do, in fact, exist as planned communities, taking the inane "run government like a business" advice as a mantra, and so never hitting the sorts of numbers that we see elsewhere.  However, I would also note that not every company looks like Walmart or Cambridge University Press, either, with the overwhelming number of companies new and tiny, building to the biggest and oldest logarithmically.

And interestingly, even Diyarbakır still has a population over a million residents, while Tokyo and Chongqing have both had thousands of years of continuous occupation.  By contrast, Cambridge University Press only has a few thousand employees, while the Waltons founded Wal-Mart Discount City in only 1962---I couldn't find any information on Genda Shigyō's size---so you don't really get both age and size in the corporate world, and either seems insignificant compared to cities.

Why?  Companies have management layers that---you guessed it---limit what employees can work on and who they can work with.  They need to keep everybody focused on work that provides a return on the labor cost.  Cities, though, don't have a profit motive, so while they have restrictions, they try to do so judiciously, in ways that we'll talk about later.

If you read Cory Doctorow's blog, for example, he has started talking a lot about the difference between a [growth stock](https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington:~:text=investors%20really%20like%20growth%20stocks) and a mature stock, when investing.  In short, a company expanding its market will have significantly more economic power next year than this year, therefore investing in it commands a higher price than a company that has no room to grow.  And whether we see it as causation or correlation, growing companies tend to "throw everything at the wall to see what sticks," in order to capture more of the market, whereas mature companies need to protect their existing market while focusing their attentions on "initiatives" most likely to turn a large profit, exactly that enormous management overhead that I mentioned.

### Network Effects

Echoing the math that I referenced before, most fields recognize something like [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law), the idea that the value of a communications system grows with the square of the number of users.  Also, though, Metcalfe thought about this in terms of one-to-one technologies, such as telephones, rather than the Internet where you can make connections and have conversations among arbitrarily large groups, which presumably[^K2kVq-] causes even faster growth.

[^K2kVq-]:  We have seen, over the past decades, that not everybody has the *capacity* to take advantage of that value.  Corporate social media, for example, often thrives on flattening nuance and creating strife to manipulate "the algorithm" by creating engagement that provides almost no value otherwise.  Therefore, I wouldn't quite commit to saying that you get a factorial-growth generation of ideas on the Internet when you have so many forces that want to *extract* value from it, effectively creating that level of corporate-style management that wants you to stick to the work that makes them money.

And it happens for the same reasons, that we care about a network because of the interactions, not the technology, Metcalfe's literal "connected stations," or even the people, because the people don't matter if you talk past each other.

In fact, [Reed's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law) already describes exactly that, reframing Metcalfe in terms of subgroups of participants.  And [Beckstrom's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckstrom%27s_law) refines that further for (mostly) economic networks, settling on the number of transactions passing through the network.

## Diversity

This also explains why, despite the rhetoric of conservatives, every study tells us that [diversity makes us smarter](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_scientific_case_for_diversity_equity_and_inclusion).  Yes, even if you somehow believe that your organization will perform better if everybody looks like you, and don't care at all about inclusion or equity, the evidence says that you'll leave money on the table by recruiting that way.  Everybody who disagrees with your approach will have a competitive advantage.

If this seems mystifying to you, recheck the prior sections.  We mostly advance by putting ideas together, so the broader the group that you can interact with, the greater the chance that your group will run across a novel idea.

This does *not* mean that organizations will benefit by discarding their standards and picking random candidates on the basis of race.  Nobody does that, and nobody recommends it.  I wrote an entire post about [affirmative action]({% post_url 2023-07-09-affirmative %}) and its successor ideas, breaking it down to the point where even a Supreme Court Justice could follow it.  But in short, pushing for diversity means proving that you didn't bias your recruitment and induction process, and making sure that the biggest merit in your meritocracy[^c2enct] doesn't happen to involve not reminding you of inequality.

[^c2enct]:  This, in fact, gets to the core problem with the idea of meritocracy, even ignoring the fact that Michael Young coined the term satirizing British schools at the time:  You can call *anything* a merit, therefore any system qualifies as a meritocracy.  Aristocracies place land ownership as a critical merit.  Monarchies place secret handshake-deals with or descent from deities as the most important merit.  But some organizations launder their target merit through proxies, whether deliberately or through ignorance, such as [standardized testing {% cc %}](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/racist-beginnings-standardized-testing).

If you don't believe it, consider how organizations that commit to diversity goals almost always meet them ahead of schedule without any sacrifice.  When given a fair chance to participate, people show up.

### Speaking of Participation

While we have veered into the lane of enabling people to participate---positive liberties strike again---the evidence also says that stress from [poverty impedes cognitive function](https://www.businessinsider.com/poverty-effect-on-intelligence-2013-8).  In the context of the case that I've built here, and recalling the many issues with standardized testing, that means that looking to hire "the smartest" people means that you exclude people who only need their bills paid to out-perform many others.  Poor people, therefore, don't participate as much in our aforementioned network effects, because they need to scramble to put food on the table instead.

And we should note that, in a lot of cases---[slavery]({% post_url 2021-02-14-reparations %}) the most egregious case---initial pushes into poverty come from wage theft or similar exploitation.  This means that, once you pay someone insufficiently for their work, they'll have difficulty performing in the future.  Their children grow up with that stress, which puts them at a disadvantage, and so on for generations to come.

Therefore, if you want those best combinations of ideas, you want to make sure that nobody has money problems, no matter their background.  Either that, or you need to concoct some hare-brained philosophy about why poor people secretly *deserve* poverty, so that you can avoid looking like you care, while your competitors out-perform you.

### Everything, but in Moderation

If this works across so many fields, we might imagine that the same goes for law in general.  Protecting people's right and ability to speak their minds makes society better.  Containing them into [free speech zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech_zone) and the like makes it worse.  Allowing [strategic lawsuits against public participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation) make it worse, especially when an entire United States presidential administration runs on them to demand tribute from media companies...for example.

Circling back to the idea of companies trying to manage ideation in such a way that only ideas that profit them show up, consider the various agreements that a new employee might need to sign, today.

- Non-disclosure agreements, which (understandably, in this case) limit the release of information.
- Non-disparagement agreements, restricting what an employee (and former employee) can say about the company, its products, and its management, often explicitly including warning prospective candidates about harmful policies.
- Non-compete agreements, restricting where a former employee can work.
- Non-poaching agreements, restricting who a former employee can work with in their new position.

While civil liberties don't often govern private corporations[^wVLPna], but you can see how this openly stifles and chills free speech.

[^wVLPna]:  Maybe they should, though, given how often corporate policies seem aimed directly at freedom of speech, the right to a speedy trial, the right to not incriminate yourself, and so forth.  Those rights probably shouldn't vanish because you have a business relationship with some corporation.

And they chill speech in a ham-fisted way, too, seemingly to make the point that they can.  Using myself as an example, at least in public, I can't think of a valid reason to bad-mouth any of my former employers, even for the companies where my non-disparagement contract has expired, because I don't want to play the part of some petty disgruntled employee.  My reputation, especially when looking for future employment, doesn't need the implication that I might turn on a prospective employer, and everybody understands that.  But, if somebody contacts me to ask if they should apply to one of my former employers, those employers had me sign those agreements to frighten me out of mentioning that, well, Mr. Scrooge[^XMCjOd] all but demands a parade of weirdo ghosts to scare the figurative fecal matter out of him and rub his nose in it like a petulant pet dog before he'll give anybody a raise.

[^XMCjOd]:  I love how, eventually, somebody who I know will almost certainly read this and believe that they know exactly who I must have meant, sure that they have found some two-hundred-character *roman à clef*, rather than the likelier possibility that I picked Scrooge as well-known character emblematic of all bad bosses.

And yet, you'll remember that I mentioned that cities don't restrict interactions, except for the harmful sorts of interaction.  And that applies here, because we don't want to fall into the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), thinking that free speech means that we need to subsidize failures in the [marketplace of ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas).

When some jerk takes his [reproductive policy from Medieval legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_and_pregnancy_statement_controversies_in_the_2012_United_States_elections) (massive content advisory on that one), when defense leaders mistake [defense readiness](https://theconversation.com/where-george-washington-would-disagree-with-pete-hegseth-about-fitness-for-command-and-what-makes-a-warrior-266530) for people they find attractive[^HXQ8WI], when [health officials repeat the arguments of eugenics](https://prismreports.org/2025/11/13/eugenics-rfk-jr-trump/), or when anybody [incites violence](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-political-violence-incitement/), we need to stop them.  Not only have smarter people thoroughly debunked their ideas decades and centuries ago, but allowing them to speak (a negative liberty, by not interfering with them) discourages others from speaking, infringing on their enabling, *positive* liberty of participating in discourse.

[^HXQ8WI]:  Look, I don't *want* to accuse Republicans of closeted homosexuality, both because I don't care about them and because I don't see homosexuality as bad.  However, when they ramble about wanting to see [virile soldiers {% cc %}](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-russian-army-emasculated_n_60a6d07de4b09604b5202cb5) and make checklists about what they [want to ogle {% cc %}](https://www.thelist.com/1984907/pege-hegseth-war-against-beards-hints-at-insecurities/), like *any* time that nominally straight men talk about what makes a man attractive, I have to call it like I see it, and wish that they'd work out their personal issues with their friends instead of inflicting them on the country.

The marketplace metaphor should mean that bad ideas go off the market when people stop buying them, not that we keep looking for ways to repackage garbage until people accidentally buy it thinking that they found something else.  We regulate markets, so that people don't feed their families expired pork or low-quality [milk whitened with plaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swill_milk_scandal).  In the same way, [safe spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_space) make sure that we don't send people back home with repackaged [phrenology {% cc %}](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5089827) or social Darwinism.

## Putting This Together

The whole copyright thing fell to the wayside, here, because---as I have said many times---it increasingly feels like a red herring.  It serves as a loose proxy of corporate abuse that gets us into fights that have *nothing* to do with market consolidation, wage theft, devaluation of art and artists, and so forth, the actual problems that we should fight and fix.

However, I think about these sorts of ideas frequently, and had forgotten where I originally grabbed the idea, so it seemed worth sharing that path.  And if you can pull your head out of that particular orifice, then you see the pattern emerge.

Society appears to benefit from bringing people together in safe ways.  Policies that encourage that work.  Policies that try to divide us, silence us, or only focus on platforming the privileged don't work.  That seems to go for corporate as well as legal policies, suggesting that the arc of the universe bends towards justice---as Martin Luther King, Jr. said, after one of Theodore Parker's abolitionist sermons---because we [do well by doing good](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/do_well_by_doing_good).
