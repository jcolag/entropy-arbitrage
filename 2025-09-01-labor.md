Today, in the United States and maybe a few other places---and I probably go to this well every year, because we have so few alternative holidays and this always comes on a Monday---we celebrate [Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day), the off-brand communist-averse retelling of International Labor Day on May first.  Kick back with a cheap mattress, curl up in the corner in anxiety about the school year starting back up (at least at my latitudes), and don't you *dare* think about unionizing your workplace, or the commies win...

With that, on to the week's projects.

## Mini-Server, Part 8

During the week, I managed to get [2FAuth](https://2fauth.app/) running.

Much as I didn't want to take the fairly obnoxious step, in defiance of all the documentation and configuration options telling me that I didn't *need* to do it, I added another alias to the server---for example, using `avahi-add-alias` to have the Raspberry Pi also respond to `http://2fauth.local`---and used the default NGINX configuration.  I needed to undo the path and server settings that I changed previously, but it worked.

However, it wouldn't import any of GNOME Authenticator's export files.  The JSON options, it claimed to not understand.  It *seemed* to understand the plain-text export, but timed out, any time that I uploaded the export file.  After a few iterations, I managed to solve that problem by breaking up the export into batches of ten sites each.

Therefore, my home network has a backup already in-place, should I have another computer disaster...as long as I remember to keep both authenticators in sync.  I probably won't drop GNOME Authenticator like I have other desktop applications, because getting 2FA codes locally makes much more sense, and I find the GNOME design more appealing.  But this does provide an alternative when I need it.

Why not use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), which I already use for a password manager, already have it integrated with most of my other tools, *and* can add a one-time password plugin?  As appealing as I find the idea of keeping everything together, doing this would mean that I'd no longer have *two*-factor authentication, since getting past my PGP key would provide everything needed to get into every account.

## Codidact

For posterity, I documented the above [solution to running 2FAuth](https://powerusers.codidact.com/posts/294451/294551#answer-294551), in case anybody stumbles across the question looking to do this on their own.

## Recipes

I have continued with non-nut butters.  This time, digging through the fridge, I found a pound of poppy seeds that I probably bought to pad out an order somewhere like [Nuts.com](https://share.nuts.com/jcolagioia!d53406ccfc!a)[^1].

[^1]:  Pardon the crassness of a sales link, but I gather that you get twenty bucks off your order if you click through, and I get a similar credit, and I have bought enough from them over the last few years that I can (a) recommend them and (b) get decent mileage out of the credit.

As you can probably guess, they didn't grind down particularly well to form a smooth paste, but I did get something that I could spread on crackers, and it tasted a lot better than (for example) poppy seeds on a bagel or any of those excessively sweet West Asian snacks that grind up poppy seeds.

As with the other butters that I've made recently, I toasted them in a pan with oil, then ground them in the food processor, adding oil to keep it cohesive and a dash of salt at the end.

Also, I can now report that the "toasted oats and shredded sweet potato" got eclipsed by "toasted oats and canned pumpkin," again with the pumpkin seed butter.  I had an old can floating around, probably originally destined for cookies, but about a quarter of the can looks like around one small banana, and I *might* actually like the flavor better than the banana.

## Entropy Arbitrage

{% github jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-code %}

Nothing particularly interesting happened, here, since I've continued moving away from GitHub, but I added a test script for my content-warning plugin.  This has allowed me to test changes by feeding in arbitrary Markdown, and inspecting the HTML that it produces, before trying it in-place on the blog.

Beyond the code, if anybody tried to access the blog last night, please accept my apologies for the brief outages.  I needed to restructure some parts of the VPS, which Linode won't do without shutting the machine down.  And then the system wouldn't start back up, because it couldn't find the drive that I removed, even though "issue an error and move on" seems like a far more appropriate way of dealing with that sort of issue.

## Libera Marks

{% codeberg jcolag/libera-marks %}

The font now has full [REUSE](https://reuse.software/)-compliant licensing, identifying Terry Hancock's icons as his, and mine as mine based on his.  The FontForge script also identifies the meaning of each file, so that anybody who wants to make their own version of this---such as myself in the future, possibly---doesn't need to keep looking up the Unicode code-points.

Maybe most useful, though, I added an [HTML page using the font in context](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/libera-marks/), plus direct download links for the font versions, to deploy on Codeberg Pages.

## Question Copyright, the Good Parts

{% codeberg jcolag/qco %}

In editing the various posts about this archive, it became apparent that the [advertising revenue article](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/170-advertising-revenue.html) had a (broken) internal link to the article about the [Creator Endorsed Mark](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/qco/095-creator-endorsed-mark.html), so it now points to the correct place.

In addition, the README file now points directly to the [archive on Codeberg Pages](https://jcolag.codeberg.pages/qco) and my [blog post explaining the archive]({% post_url 2025-08-24-trawling-qco %}).

## Entropy Arbitrage, the Posts

{% codeberg jcolag/entropy-arbitrage-posts %}

While GitHub will continue to receive updates to posts in the same process, you should now think of this repository as the primary or official location for all posts.  I haven't made any non-routine changes, but this has enough of a history and a consistent series of updates, so it made more sense to start the migration here.

## Notoboto

{% codeberg jcolag/Notoboto %}

Like the blog posts, the primary version of the repository now lives on Codeberg.  Unlike the blog posts, I copied it over when fixing a bug in the CSON code, where it expected the old version of the function when making the recursive call.

And since the problem manifested with this repository first, even though it doesn't relate specifically to **Notoboto**, it seems worth mentioning that, because the blog's GitHub and Codeberg plugins use the same cached file to store the repository metadata---and since both sites use the same "key," because I have the same username on both sites and will try to preserve the repository names---as repositories migrate over, you might occasionally continue to see the preview image from GitHub instead of Codeberg, until I notice and yank the entry out of the table for it to rebuild.

## Next

Almost certainly, the headlines next week will involve moving repositories over to Codeberg from GitHub.  I'll start slow, probably one repository per day, at least for a while, so that I don't overburden Codeberg's infrastructure.  Chances seem good some GitHub work will continue, since readers should see some pointers back to Codeberg.
