This week, our [Free Culture Book Club]({% post_url 2020-05-02-freeculture %}) finishes reading the *Aether Galaxy* information, everything except for the **Foundational Guide**.

![A galaxy](/blog/assets/aether-galaxy.png "No, not too far away...")

To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

 * Full Title:  *Aether Galaxy*
 * Location:  <https://github.com/tfclarkdesigns/Aether-Galaxy>, <https://tfclarkdesigns.github.io/Aether-Galaxy/>
 * Released:  2025 --
 * License:  CC BY
 * Creator:  Terrance Clark
 * Medium:  RPG Supplement
 * Length:  Approximately seventeen thousand words
 * Content Advisories:  An entire supplement on fascist ideology, violence

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Aether Galaxy

The repository describes itself as follows.

> Mythic space-opera setting released under CC BY 4.0. An open galaxy for writers, artists, GMs, and world-builders. "No canon, only coherence."
>
> ...
>
> Aether Galaxy takes place ages ago, in a far-distant galaxy of many advanced species. Civilization is shaped by two Great Powers—and by the ancient Orders that stand beside them.
>
> ...
>
> Nine thousand years have passed since the Commonwealth’s founding. The balance of the galaxy stands upon the edge of a blade. Without heroes, there can be no hope.

And now, other than that I discovered it because the creator occasionally posts to Mastodon under reasonable tags, you know pretty much what I do about the project.

## What Works Well?

The explanatory pieces---*The Astrogation Holodex* and *The Will of Order*---feel like they have more life in them than the main book.  I don't always agree with the choices, but the descriptions have appropriate voices and explain why we might care.  I don't know if it happened purposely, I can even appreciate the bit of hypocrisy in the Iron Dominion's philosophy that they obsess over Nature (in the *survival of the fittest* sense) and conveniently consider technology a natural occurrence[^qKwU9Y].

[^qKwU9Y]:  I haven't seen it stated that way before, but you see it all the time, with someone fitting the philosophy's broad description on the Internet loudly denouncing feminism, homosexuality, accessibility, or whatever as "unnatural," as if publishing thoughts immediately and cheaply to a potential audience of billions, from indoor comfort, bears any resemblance to this alleged natural world.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

The story, *The Kols Files*, often feels more like a tour through the reference material than an actual story.  Rather than setting a tone, it gives us lists of equipment with prices, taglines, and descriptions, all lifted directly from the other files in the collection.  It sometimes gestures at storytelling, but almost immediately cuts the story off to tell us how tall lizard-people stand or something.

I don't really see any other worries/opportunities, so I actually want to talk about that a bit more.  First, we should probably see the story so far as the earliest chapters of a first draft.  Each chapter only runs about seven hundred words[^4Rc56l]; if we use E.M. Forster's often-cited guideline that a novel contains at least fifty thousand words, then we would expect over seventy chapters, which...seems unlikely.  Likewise, the chapters themselves have shown up spaced apart, telling me that the author puts them together in their spare time and commits them soon after.

[^4Rc56l]:  For comparison, this post goes on about twenty-five percent *longer* than one of the story chapters.  Which also raises the point that you have no excuse not to read them, if you got this far through the post...

Because of this, it seems worth talking about how close this comes to doing fairly well for itself.  It *could* have the snappy narration of a rambling hard-boiled detective, where these details evolve into a personality (of the character and the world) of semi-self-aware attempts to sound "with it."  Without that personality, though, it gives the impression that the setting has a population of people who memorize fun facts about how much certain kinds of people weigh and how much everything costs...

## Opportunities

The GitHub repository has seemed highly active since October, though with only the one contributor so far.

## What's Adaptable?

Two of the pieces, *The Astrogation Holodex* and *The Field Catalog of Weros*, specifically exist as elements, most of which any science fiction work could borrow.  As mentioned, *The Will of Order* similarly does a decent job of providing a mostly cohesive philosophy for melodramatic fascist types.

## Coming Attractions

Next up, we'll play **Skynet Simulator**, a web-based game that probably only slightly needs to worry about trademark infringement.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the setting?
