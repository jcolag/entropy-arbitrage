To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Viaje a la Tierra del Quebracho

On the Internet Archive, they describe the film---the title translating to *Voyage to the Land of Quebracho* in English, presumably in reference to [the tree by that name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebracho_tree) also known as a "break-axe"---as follows.

 > A boy starts an adventure following the railroad tracks, guided by a dream, and his curious and playful spirit. In his particular ordeal he will discover historical events that relate to the hard life of the forest loggers, an impetuous, exploitative company, and the displacement of the aboriginal inhabitants, in a story that brings alive the identity of different villages that are one. What is the past? Becoming aware of it, can change the history? Can we feel affection and belonging to that which we do not live but, strangely, we identify?

 > **Viaje a la Tierra del Quebracho** is a short film animation produced in Santa Fe, Argentina, that recovers the reality of so-called forest villages, and legends that emerged there, giving life to those silent witnesses that well refer us to a recent and significant past recreated in fantastic key. The short film has been produced in the contest from the local government Espacio Santafecino, can be distributed freely (under a CC BY-SA license) and has been made with free software.

It has Spanish-language audio and titles, with subtitles in Aymara, English, Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Quechua, Russian, and Swedish.

## What Works Well?

While we could dismiss it as a matter of taste, I love the fluidity of the animation, and where it chooses to focus its attention.  The old town and the introduction of Guala, especially look and feel impressive.

The film also handles the emotional side of its storytelling well, pacing out its revelation, and giving them time to sink in.  It works especially well with an audience proxy who doesn't know much about that world.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Especially given the brevity of the film, the story feels extremely abstract.  I can vaguely fill in some of the blanks, because I looked up most of the couple of names mentioned, in writing this post, but I definitely couldn't tell you if this revolves around a specific incident or a broad kind of action.  I don't understand the reasons for the train-mounted cells to exist or what they mean to the story.  You get the idea.

## Opportunities

I sincerely doubt that we'll find anything.  They released the film more than fifteen years ago, without any source material or community.

## What's Adaptable?

I can't really think of any element definitely unique to the story other than *possibly* Guala, the mystical guardian of Quebracho.  I say "possibly," because this could stem from a prior character from folklore or mythology, and I couldn't find anybody who documented it.  That would potentially cause appropriation problem, if so.

## Next

Coming up next week, we'll read the introductory chapter of new comic **Antumbra**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the animation?
