As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

We all saw this result coming, right?  When you outsource your actual thinking to something---or somebody, for that matter---who doesn't care about what you need, it warps how you see things.

In 2018, Musk began working with designer Emily Dawn Long on his new look, supposedly looking to channel macho male icons such as Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.

Hashtags:  #Oligarchy

Every time these people come back into the public eye, I have to stifle a laugh, because they seem so thoroughly *desperate*.  They know that the world sees them as creepy weirdos, because they act that way, but because they can't bother with acting in another way, they try to look macho and important, instead.  It looked fake when they dressed like TV hackers, fake when they dressed in cheap suits, and fake now that they dress like low-rent Superman villains.

 > The agency operates a fleet of 18 satellites that are packed with instruments dedicated to observing weather phenomena essential to predicting the weather, from how hot the land surface is to the water content of the atmosphere. Some are geostationary satellites which sit high above different parts of the U.S. measuring weather conditions 24/7. Others orbit the planet.

Hashtags:  #NOAA #Privatization #Economy

I actually (slightly) disagree with the premise, but find it acceptable, because while I think that anybody *could* do what NOAA does, no company ever actually would, because the return-on-investment only makes sense for a government.  I realized this maybe fifteen years ago, and almost entirely stopped paying attention to other weather reports, because---especially for the ranges that I'll care about most---it doesn't really make much sense to look at the downstream forces that all draw from what the government provides to everybody.

Hashtags:  #USPol #Trump #Resistance

I keep coming back to the early days of COVID-19 (and Trump), when literally the same people who want to stop all government payments now---and pretty much at all times in the last fifty years---suddenly scrambled to send money to everybody.  Why?  We all stopped leaving the house.  Most specifically, I believe, we stopped buying things.

Stick with me, here.  If you think about the economy, and try to model it, you might (and probably should) come up with a large heap of *things*, each resting on something below it.  Money flows up the heap, to get through this idea quickly.  I rely (stand) on somebody who pays me for my work.  They rely (stand) on their customers.  Stores rely (stand) on me and you.  And those relationships spread in both directions.

Now, every time somebody chooses not to or fails to *pay*, it destabilizes the heap.  Depending on the precarity of someone's situation and the amount that they expected, that instability could have no effects, or it might cause them to fail to pay somebody else.  And when an entire country stops shopping for a couple of weeks due to a mystery illness, that hurts billionaires, who rely on the entire system.  People might not even need to march, especially with some preparation...

 > The reasons for weaponizing division are not mysterious. Racial fear prevents Americans from building community with one another and community is the lifeblood of a functioning democratic society. Throughout our history, racist language has been used to turn American against American in order to benefit the wealthy elite.

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > The Mayan language is a vehicle to rescue the knowledge that grandmothers and grandfathers have. Through it, we can learn the details of traditional gastronomy, astronomy, agriculture and natural remedies. Documenting the ancestral knowledge that exists in the Mayan language represents an important legacy for future generations. Thanks to the transmission of this knowledge, our parents, grandparents, and even ourselves, have managed to survive.
