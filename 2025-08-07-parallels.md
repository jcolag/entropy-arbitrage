## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Parallels

Since we got together last time, the **Deep Space Nine** crew tried to balance the need to protect refugees with xenophobic fears, plus *maybe* the wildest list of guest stars of any episode, in *Sanctuary*.  Back over here, I remember this as one of my favorite episodes at the time, so I'll try to tamp down my enthusiasm and/or questioning some combination of whether it holds up and my priorities in late 1993.

 > **WORF**: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were difficult. Several contenders were maimed. But I was triumphant. I won champion standing. I am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the *Enterprise*. However, I am anticipating a troubling situation.

It sounds like the Klingon weapon of choice also names the martial arts form using it.  I can't find any sports from our world that do that, though we have more than a few sports whose names mean "fighting with" the weapon in question.  The oddity makes me wonder if the Klingon language doesn't distinguish between the two, equivalent to if we renamed fencing "sword," or if the *translation* doesn't bother with multiple words, as if we talked about overseas athletes heading for the "ball semi-finals."

In our world, we have a comparable example of a similar dynamic in [chopsticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks), where the term *may* derive from a translation through a pidgin from the original Chinese 筷子/kuàizi---"quick bamboo," via "chop chop" to hurry---but could instead derive from *chow*, for "food," also sometimes rendered as "chop," which would dismissively conflate the tool with the target of the activity, and arguably the activity itself.

Also, if Forcas III sounds familiar, we haven't watched the parts with this crew for the post, yet, but the place does get a mention in [**Generations**]({% post_url 2022-04-28-generations %}), which we'll revisit in December.

 > **RIKER**: It looks like we're going to have to head into to the Argus Array. This is the third time this year it's stopped relaying data. Starfleet's beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. I want you to start a long range scan once we get. Lieutenant? Are you listening to me?

After six seasons of these weirdos, it'll probably keep me up nights wondering if they've spent all this time having Riker get ambushed by routine information from every mission all for this scene to tip us off that something has gone wrong, as Riker gets to complain that somebody else stopped paying attention...

Also, who would bother to listen to him?  Half the time, he only wants to talk about sex or whine about the existence of non-humans.

 > **RIKER**: A surprise party? Mister Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would never do that to you.

Again, this might serve as a small hint, because we saw Riker celebrating his birthday in [*Future Imperfect*]({% post_url 2023-12-28-future-imperfect %}), though I don't believe that we know how the celebration started.  He did seem delighted by tricking Wesley into moping around before his surprise party in [*The Game*]({% post_url 2024-06-20-game %}), though.

That said, the line might also set up the "joke" revealing that, no, he loves surprise parties in a bit and nothing more.  I do vastly prefer the idea that the entire episode actually has us slipping between versions of the same scenes, second by second, though.

 > **WORF**: That was not a Klingon song.
 >
 > **TROI**: It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingon word for jolly.

I find it interesting that she *completely* ignores his complaint that they, in effect, misappropriated Klingon culture to force it into an English-shaped space, in favor of complaining about the difficulty of doing so.

And this goes back to my first question in the post.  Have Klingons *never* had such a word, or does the Federation mistranslate it as something else, such as drunkenness...which some people use as a meaning for [jolly](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jolly)?  I don't ask that idly, by the way.  For a famous, but non-institutional, example, the story goes that, when the press asked Japanese Premier Kantaro Suzuki about the terms of surrender from the Allies in 1945, he apparently said [mokusatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokusatsu) (黙殺), idiomatically meaning "no comment," as in ignoring the question.  But Western translators took a more extreme but still plausible interpretation of "I treat it with silent contempt," leading the Allies to demand an unconditional surrender, and presumably spurring the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, eighty years ago yesterday and Saturday, as this post goes out.

As an added layer to this, history getting written by the victors and all, and Suzuki dying only three years later, Western historians have largely rallied behind the idea that the confrontational interpretation holds, and the Japanese (therefore and allegedly) want to hide behind semantic games instead of taking the blame for the destruction of two of their own cities.  And, you know, that *certainly* doesn't sound politically motivated[^3]...

[^3]:  And yes, this issue has complexity and nuance to it.  More like the Allies than, for example, Germany, the Japanese government spent decades dismissing their responsibility for and sometimes even the existence of the atrocities committed by their forces.  The Chinese and Koreans, especially, have little interest in seeing the Japanese portrayed as victims of the war.  And I think that underscores my point, that a subtle shift in the emotional tone of a translation can have massive effects on perception in politically charged environments.

Anyway, imagine cultural enmity that stretches back for at least a century, and what that might do to relations between those two powers, if the dictionaries didn't have any means of describing happiness.  I'll probably have reason to revisit this idea in the future, but such biased translation, especially systemically enforced through their universal translator gadgets, could explain a lot about why so many cultures---Klingons, Vulcans, Romulans, Ferengi---seem flattened to a broad caricature.

In our world, these days, think especially of the translations of Iranian statements in Western media.  Hearing only those translations for the past few decades, you could plausibly believe that nobody over there can open their mouths without calling for death and destruction.  Persian does apparently have many idiomatic phrases for disapproval that reference death, hence translations like "death to America" that could equally mean "America should stop interfering," hence the semi-famous "death to jet lag" phrase used a lot by Iranian travelers on social media.  And we still debate [what Mahmoud Ahmadinejad meant](https://fair.org/home/lost-in-translation/) in 2006 when the **New York Times** translated his speech as calling to "wipe Israel off the map," when he appears to have quoted a religious leader, who *may have* said something more like the right-wing (as in led by pro-occupation, warmongering factions) Israeli government will fade from history.  But the West made policy around the first and most aggressive translation.

Oh, and I almost forgot about the direct reference.  I should also mention that they use the melody of [*For He's a Jolly Good Fellow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_He%27s_a_Jolly_Good_Fellow), primarily because until only ten years ago---more than twenty years in the future of this episode---[Warner Brothers insisted that they owned the rights to *Happy Birthday*](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/happy-birthday-everybody-victory-public-domain-asterisk) until somebody literally found evidence that the more common song probably *never* had a legitimate copyright.  Therefore, while every *real* person sang that song at birthdays, corporate settings such as television shows and restaurants tried to find free alternatives.  Those of you following Free Culture happenings might even remember the Free Music Archive's [New Birthday Song Contest](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Happy_Birthday_Song_Contest/The_New_Birthday_Song_Contest)[^4] shortly before Warner gave up, to bring attention to the situation and also look for an alternative.

[^4]:  "Not safe for work," but I still have a certain fondness for and occasionally send out a link to #110, *Foul Mouthed Birthday Robot*.  Some others come off as more plausible, replacements though...

And as a possible in-universe reason for using the specific song instead of making something up like restaurants of the day often did, *Jolly* borrows its own melody from eighteenth-century French folk song [*Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbrough_s%27en_va-t-en_guerre).

 > **DATA**: Yes. I have entered my Expressionistic phase. This is my interpretation of the Battle of HarOS.

[Expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism) deals in subjective, emotional experience over objective reality, again making me wonder how carefully they wrote this.  After all, they generously spared us from the usual "but he has no emotions" nonsense, *but* for Data to casually talk about joining the Expressionist movement as if that would fit with his usual rhetoric seems out of place.  But the show also has a tradition of sloppy writing, and maybe they only happened to find an Expressionist painting that they liked and decided to shove it into the show, so I don't know...

Note that they did *not*, however, spare us from Data trying to fit an organic narrative onto his clear choice to try out a style.  "Expressionistic phase" tries to imply that all artists stumble into this, and his time has now come, rather than acknowledging that artists move to what resonates with them, and *he* probably set an e-mail notification to remind him to start making Expressionist paintings.  It reminds me a lot of his comment in [*The Nth Degree*]({% post_url 2024-03-14-nth-degree %}) about objecting to Barclay's performance for not using the same acting style that he chose.

 > **LAFORGE**: Nice. The Battle of HarOS, right?

Not to talk about the episode itself---though we spend so little time with "our" characters that I don't even know if the post even has any validity---but I get a kick out of this line.  Either he gets the painting's goals immediately, or Data wouldn't shut up about it, and he wants the quick laugh of *looking* like he recognized it, and either way, it feels consistent with, but far less uncomfortable than, the La Forge who constantly feels the need to one-up his peers and acts like women owe him affection.

 > **TROI**: Don't I wish. This is from Alexander. He gave it me just before he left to visit your parents. Thank you.

Troi, remember, only really has that one character trait.  If she didn't have anything to say about chocolate, and since we don't have a fascist around trying to seduce her, would she really even appear in the episode...?

And Alexander still exists, I guess, though not significantly enough that they might pay the performer.

Also...can't they make *any* food at any time?  Get a slice of your own damned cake if you don't like what they have on the table, lady...

 > **WORF**: I am...old enough.

This feels jarring, to me.  Yes, we have spent six years and change watching a crew of bigots who won't shut up about their ideas about how biology governs psychology (not that they would use that phrasing) despite all evidence to the contrary, dismiss the experiences of anybody outside their little privileged gossip circle, and seem not entirely sold on the idea of women in the workforce, or in public, for that matter.  But I don't believe that they have *ever* had a problem with somebody because of their age, excepting that time that Picard tried to run the ship from the body of a teenager in [*Rascals*]({% post_url 2025-01-02-rascals %}) and ever-sensitive Riker wouldn't stop sneering at him.

 > **DATA**: The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir.
 >
 > **RIKER**: That can't be right. We were told the Array stopped relaying data six days ago.
 >
 > **DATA**: The Array is still transmitting data, sir, but it is no longer sending that information to the Federation. It appears someone has redirected its imaging systems.

That seems *not* "functioning normally," then, no?  I mean, normal surely includes performing the task that they set it up to do.  The technology might have no faults, but the overall device certainly does not currently do what they expect, and you'd think that Lieutenant Commander Pedantry[^1] would grasp that.

[^1]:  Well, actually, I think you mean [sophistry](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sophistry), John, given how often his "corrections" get the premise wrong...

 > **WORF**: It has never been easy for me having Alexander on board. I have always tried to be a good father, to give him guidance, but he seems to have his own mind about some things.

He hides the burden well, by which I mean that the show couldn't bother itself to involve the character since wasting our time with [*A Fistful of Datas*]({% post_url 2025-01-09-fistful-datas %}).  Seriously, *seven* appearances, few of which give him enough focus where we'd know about this, for a character causing so much angst.

 > **TROI**: Worf, that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.

Really?  He didn't say anything about the quality of the parenting, and it feels like any assignment of surrogate parenting feels like it raises all sorts of awkward commentary about gender roles and age, which most people would *not* find particularly nice.

That said, who knows what people *usually* say to her, between episodes.  I haven't had much nice to say about her, certainly.

 > **TROI**: That would make my mother your step-mother.
 >
 > **WORF**: I had not considered that. It is a risk I am willing to take.

We can't have the audience thinking that somebody might expect to see an outspoken mature woman treated like a *person*.

Also, Troi's analysis seems wrong.  In the metaphor, her father could've married into the family, for example.

 > **LAFORGE**: We're only three light years from Cardassian space. They would have easy access to the Array.

Then why leave it there?  Does it serve as a [honey-trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_trapping) to provoke a confrontation, or does it usually spy *on* the Cardassians?  The Cardassian captain will actually ask that latter question later, in fact, showing that the possibility exists, and Picard will blow off the question and try to shoo him out of the area.

 > **WORF**: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were difficult. Several contenders were maimed. One of the contenders used an illegal T'gha maneuver against me. The judges chose to ignore it, and I was robbed of my rightful standing. I was awarded ninth place. I am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the *En*---

K'Daniel of House LaRusso keeps failing up[^2], I see.

[^2]:  Those of you not laughing can ask the older adults in your life to explain the joke.

 > **DATA**: Lieutenant, have you completed the metallurgical scan of the Array?

That sounds like busy-work to me, something that the computer probably already does independently all the time.

 > **TROI**: Worf, let's assume for a second you're right, that things did happen as you remember them. Are you saying that everyone's memory on this ship has been altered but yours?

At this point in the series, this feels like a question that actually *did* fall out of an entirely different show.  Troi got almost exactly this question in [*The Child*]({% post_url 2022-11-24-child %}) and [*Night Terrors*]({% post_url 2024-02-29-night-terrors %}), not to mention her assorted "feeling great pain" that everybody tunes out.  La Forge had to deal with that nonsense not too long ago in [*Interface*]({% post_url 2025-06-12-interface %}).  The entire plots of [*Clues*]({% post_url 2024-02-08-clues %}), *The Game*, and [*Conundrum*]({% post_url 2024-08-15-conundrum %}) hinge on Data's unique perspective.  They took turns doing that to each other in [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}).  Maybe they should retire this line of reasoning, because everybody's mind/memory/personality except for one key person seems to happen to them a *lot*.

 > **RIKER**: Firing photon torpedoes. Full spread. Direct hit on their main reactor. They're returning fire.

Minor point, but notice that, with all their automation, Riker needs to use Worf's computer.  And Worf's hesitation strongly suggests that people need to memorize the user interface, instead of having the computer adapt to them.

 > **PICARD**: What happened back there, Lieutenant?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: Memory loss? What are you talking about?

In any universe, they apparently can't wait to look at Worf as somewhere between useless and a potential threat.  Seriously, look at the glare Riker gives him shortly before this after the danger has passed.

 > **TROI**: Come and sit down. I just want you to relax for a minute. There. You are so tense. Now, I know you don't want to talk about what happened on the Bridge, but there are times when it's just best to let things out. Come on. If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to?

Unrelated to the post, they play this scene so well, and honestly, I wish that they had stuck with this relationship.  I joked above about Troi not having any personality traits beyond her desire for more chocolate, but she has occasionally manifested sparks of a personality around Worf since at least [*The Most Toys*]({% post_url 2023-09-28-most-toys %}) when she seemed to make it her purpose in life to needle Worf into an emotional outburst.

 > **DATA**: It is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortly after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. It was six months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formal permission to court Counselor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would be dishonorable.

I skipped the original mention of [*Ethics*]({% post_url 2024-08-29-ethics %}), because this mention lays out most of the plot for us.

 > **DATA**: I am not privy to the exact details of when, where or how your first coupling took place. I could investigate it---

This sounds suspiciously like the bit in *Cause and Effect*, where Data seems all too eager to talk about the moments of sexual intimacy that he casually eavesdrops on.

 > **WORF**: Everyone was at my birthday party. Then I was with Counselor Troi, then Commander La Forge came in. Geordi. Geordi was present at all three locations. And he was near me in each case just before I noticed the differences. There has to be a connection.

Look, I get that *Star Trek* needs to *Star Trek*, so they need a physical thing to blame their problems on.  But c'mon, blaming the Black guy with the disability, because he *existed* in the same space as you remember getting dizzy feels like suspect behavior...

 > **OGAWA**: Geordi's dead.

Hey, Ogawa still exists.  And alternate universes landed her a promotion, to boot.

 > **CRUSHER**: *Doctor* Ogawa?

Heh.  Yeah, how dare she go to medical school, right?  She needs to stick to peon-ing.

 > **DATA**: All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changed through any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence.

This sounds totally made-up, and I can't speak to alternate universes, but this *could* refer to the [hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line), measured by electron spin-flips, which does have a fixed frequency.  And sure, that *also* sounds totally made-up, but we actually build technology based on that principle, so it probably works...

 > **RIKER**: Four years. Ever since Captain Picard was killed in the incident with the Borg. You don't remember any of this, do you?

Well, I mentioned a bunch of other episodes, so it'd feel wrong not to mention [*The Best of Both Worlds*]({% post_url 2023-11-09-best-both-worlds-part-2 %}).

 > **WESLEY**: Captain, I'm picking up a minor subspace disturbance off the port bow.

Notice that Ogawa only really got the one scene, but Wesley will loiter, as if the multiverse wants us to feel thankful for the version of the show that we have, because a slightly different quantum resonance thingie would've centered the self-entitled brat.

 > **DATA**: It appears to be a quantum fissure in the space-time continuum.

If you like that phrase, boy, does the final season of **Lower Decks** (and the spinoff it spent so much time trying to set up) have some good news for you...

 > **TROI**: We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a three-year-old boy, Eric Christopher.

Did she send them out to get dry-cleaned or something?  I feel like it would take a *lot* of work to not notice two toddlers living in those quarters with them, and it worries me a bit that we see no evidence of them.

Also, seriously, you marry a guy who has wrapped his entire identity up in his reconstruction of Klingon culture, and you name your kids after a [fantasy franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannara) and maybe the most generic mainstream American name that the writers could scrounge up?

 > **WESLEY**: The Bajoran ship is disengaging, sir.

I get it.  One instance of this crew already takes a *lot* of patience.

 > **DATA**: In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should restore the barriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their own realities.

Sure, exactly like how, when you patch a leak in the boat, all the water vanishes to wherever it came from.

 > **RIKER**: This is Captain Riker of the *Enterprise*. That is, the *Enterprise* which is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantum anomaly. We think we have found a way to return all of us to our proper realities, but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certain quantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit that signature to you now.

They want the *shuttle*, though, not the ship.  They have no reason to believe that the shuttle that they need landed on the ship that they asked for.

 > **RIKER**: We won't go back. You don't know what it's like in our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We're one of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us!

You know, for an episode about Worf, seemingly designed to test the waters for pairing he and Troi, Riker managed to weasel his way into a *lot* of extra screen-time...

 > **RIKER**: I'm looking forward to reading your report.

Oh, no, he still ended up in the wrong universe, where Riker might consider studying a legitimate activity...

 > **TROI**: I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. I'm sure you have to meditate, or hit yourself with a pain stick or something.

Wow, she managed to somehow make that semi-sweet moment racist, for some reason.

## Conclusions

We don't actually know which parts of this episode reflect on the version of the Federation that we've come to know, but we'll assume that Worf not screaming about ritual sacrifice or everybody speaking in French means that he only really finds cosmetic differences and recent divergences.

### The Bad

We see multiple hints of not treating the Klingon language seriously, where translations may either dismiss the importance of some activities or systematically skew interpretations of what Klingons might want to say.  They also seem thrilled by the prospect of appropriating Klingon culture for themselves by forcing it to fit into English (and French) forms.  And we see some direct aggression towards Worf, plus some offensive stereotypes, and an apparent dismissal of Klingon names for children.

Data continues to try to insist on formats for artwork and impose them on everyone else.  And he doesn't seem to think that a device doing the wrong thing seems outside the "normal" operation.  He also expresses a deep interest in investigating the sexual activities of his colleagues.

We see a brief hint of ageism in Worf's reluctance to disclose his age to people who have all probably already read his personnel file.  And the characters go extremely far out of their way to remind us that they don't approve of mature women out in the world.

While it does happen in another universe, we get further evidence that user interfaces on Federation computers make no intuitive sense.

And after many such incidents where only one of their number could see or understand something that nobody else could, they still insist that they should discount outliers without extensive validation.

The obsession with status also seems to linger, with even Crusher seeming to find it objectionable that one of her employees has her job in another universe.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in seven days, when we'll find out how seriously the Federation takes its opposition to cloaking devices, and probably forces me to do a deep dive into some of the most fringe conspiracy theories of the era, in *The Pegasus*.
