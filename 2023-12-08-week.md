As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > The fact that they've split into warring factions on its particulars is less important than their unified belief in the certain coming of the paperclip-maximizing apocalypse.

Hashtags:  #AI

I've wanted to put together a full post along similar lines for a while.  My entry point---when I eventually get around to writing it---starts with the idea that bureaucracies effectively serve as artificial intelligences, systems of rules that absolve participants of responsibility for decisions.

Once you see that idea, which I *believe* that I adapted from Sugata Mitra maybe, you can expose this weird conflict over the future of AI as dystopian storytelling.  Specifically, good dystopia takes existing problems that certain people---who society doesn't, as a rule, really care about, such as women or minorities---live with, and "repackages" the problem for a privileged audience.

In other words, the hand-wringing over language models comes down to wealthy people finally realizing that uncaring, unaccountable systems could cause a problem for *them*, instead of the rest of us.

Please, though, tell me again how we don't need to care about diversity programs or audit existing programs, because we can trust people to make unbiased decisions and find the best talent...

I don't love the cheering for anybody's death that we often see on the Internet, but I do have to admit that the world certainly feels safer without Henry Kissinger in it...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [The Heritage Foundation is looking for fascismâ€™s new foot soldiers. It might not go well](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/12/1/2209121/-The-Heritage-Foundation-is-looking-for-fascism-s-new-foot-soldiers-It-might-not-go-well) from Daily Kos

 > Heritage is looking for people like themselves, conservative loyalists who can keep insisting that Conservatism Is The Way no matter how many real-world disasters they leave in their wake. The ideal conservative administration would be full of Larry Kudlows, top to bottom. Not even the arch-conservative but jail-averse Bill Barr could pass muster with this crowd *now*.

I feel like I point this out often, but it bears repeating:  How little faith do you have in your own power, how weak and impotent do you need to feel, to put time into a plan like this that---at its best---can only ever prevent people from pointing out your inevitable mistakes?  Surely, if they thought that they had any kind of right on their side or any ability to fight, they could withstand criticism and rules.  But they don't have either.

 > Overall, there are a lot of interesting projects that got funded this round. Thereâ€™s a mix of supporting and scaling existing projects, as well as funding new ideas.

I find "minor" reporting like this---little more than a list of grant awards---because it often highlights projects that you or I might want to take a closer look at.  For example, [Commune](https://commune.sh/) looks fascinating.
