* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > For example, in some high-poverty sub-Saharan African countries, as many as two out of three adults operate or are in the process of starting their own business.

The logic of wealthy people creating companies and jobs never made any sense to me, since only one demographic has the need to get things done quickly, and they don't exactly have pools of money to swim in...

I feel like we've reached the point where, if they could get away with it, companies would fire everybody and charge customers extra to do the work to provide the goods and services that they've "purchased"...but didn't actually purchase, because you can only buy a license.

Well, I can't imagine *this* going at all wrong.  And you can bet that Project 2025 doesn't have "increase funding and staffing to the FDA to fix this" on its agenda...

 > One of the first steps the Pakistani establishment took in quelling the uprising was cutting off the internet in major Baloch cities and towns. Phone networks were also shut down in parts of Balochistan, including Gwadar. This meant that the BYC had to resort to more traditional ways of mobilizing.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-06-at-12.16.41%E2%80%AFPM-800x399.png|Beloved Trinidad and Tobago saxophonist Roy Cape, playing at the 2011 graduation ceremony at the University of the West Indies‚Äô St. Augustine campus, where he was conferred with a doctorate|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Roy Cape, whose music provided the beat of Trinidad & Tobago Carnival, dies leaving a precious legacy](https://globalvoices.org/2024/09/06/roy-cape-whose-music-provided-the-beat-of-trinidad-tobago-carnival-dies-leaving-a-precious-legacy/) from Global Voices

 > Fondly known as ‚ÄúPapi,‚Äù Cape was a cultural institution. When Steel Talks, a website dedicated to steelpan music and history, once noted, ‚ÄúIf you remove [Cape] from the time-line, his significant and global impact to date on Pan culture, the art form and music world in general would be voided ‚Äî and all that exists because of his interactions would never have been.‚Äù

I find it amazing how many people revolutionized some corner of art, but because they did so outside the United States, it takes effort for me to learn about them at all, let alone during their prime.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [A Brief History of the Fediverse Symbol ](https://wedistribute.org/2024/09/history-fediverse-symbol/) from We Distribute

 > While it doesn‚Äôt count as a logo itself, the visual motifs in this diagram were extremely influential, leading to many different open source, decentralized communication systems to adopt dots, lines, and dynamic mesh patterns in their designs.

It astonishes me how many people propose logos for Free Software projects that outright copy some famous proprietary design because a word connects them.  But otherwise, it seems worth seeing the strange evolution of trying to encapsulate the idea of federated social media into a single image.
