As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I like to assume that the bust on the right, wearing a crown, blouse, and jacket, then shows up on the left, pointing with arms clad in sleeves made from woven wood slats...")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > On-demand shared mobility that feeds into well-developed public transportation systems could reduce the number of vehicles in some cities by 90 percent and cut transportation emissions by 50 percent — but only if it largely replaces private car use.

Hashtags:  #Transit #Sustainability #Mobility

This gets directly to the problem with these initiatives.  They seem great, *but* when you don't pair them with initiatives to reduce through-traffic, they still make alternatives available to *some* benefit, but don't actually make much of a dent in problems.

While I don't want to call this a "silver lining" or similarly imply that these destructive orders have done any good, I'd bet that, especially at that age, those students learned more and probably more permanently from the improvised lesson than a lecture on Jim Crow laws or similar.

 > This is not about antisemitism. This is not about protecting Jewish students. That is the pretext. That is the fig leaf. Because if it were about antisemitism, the administration would not be gutting the very civil rights infrastructure meant to protect against it. This is about power. It is about ideological purification.

Hashtags:  #Education #Fascism #Resistance

This fight, I think, will prove interesting.  From what I can tell, schools have *finally* internalized the lesson that they don't really resemble the Ivy League schools in any way, in terms of who they serve and how they should spend their money.  In this context, though, they either stand together and show the power of solidarity or betray their students and communities while a handful of elite institutions survive.

And even if it doesn't specifically reduce homelessness, it still seems like a good idea...

 > Forced to borrow 30 million francs from French banks to make the first two payments, it was hardly a surprise to anyone when Haiti defaulted soon thereafter. Still, a subsequent French king sent another expedition in 1838 with 12 warships to force the Haitian president’s hand.

Hashtags:  #Haiti #Reparations

The treatment of Haiti always seems especially galling---no pun intended, I promise---because both the United States and France revolted against oppression to form democracies, then largely tried to prevent enslaved Haitians from doing the same thing, because both governments worried that the revolutionary fervor might spread to *other* slaves.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [With Congress Preparing a “Fiscal Tsunami,” States Can Choose Differently](https://otherwords.org/with-congress-preparing-a-fiscal-tsunami-states-can-choose-differently/) from OtherWords

 > In 2021, Washington State enacted a capital gains tax on the sale of high-end stocks and bonds by the state’s wealthiest residents. It was designed to address the state’s historically regressive tax system, which disproportionately burdened low- and middle-income earners.
 >
 > In its first two years, the tax generated $1.3 billion, funding critical services such as child care and education. And the number of millionaire households actually went up, despite some threats about wealthy people leaving the state (fact check: False!).

I've always thought that a well-designed economy should tax the wealthy, if on no other basis than that money doesn't scale linearly.  If I have ten dollars, I can afford far more than ten people with one dollar, in other words.  And there comes a point, as we've seen over and over, where you have enough money where you...stop spending, but still get the benefits.  If we must have ultra-wealthy people, force their money to act like everybody else's by taking that non-linear margin...

Oddly not mentioned, though, that they *intended* to have this chilling effect, so it makes no sense to sit back and wait for them to learn some lesson about interfering with academia.
