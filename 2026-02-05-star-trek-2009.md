All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, once again.  This film takes place both significantly after **The Next Generation**, except for the majority in another universe, so we shouldn't expect identical politics and socialization.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of anything.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## 2009's Star Trek

Since last time...nothing happened.  As mentioned multiple times, the sputtering end of **Enterprise** looked a heck of a lot like the end of the franchise.  At the time, some preliminary work had already begun on this film, but (as I probably mentioned) nobody trusts rumors that a major studio plans to eventually get around to producing a film in a franchise that hasn't done well in close to a decade.

Why talk about this film at all, considering that it takes place in an alternate timeline that the franchise has largely abandoned?  Much like [*These Are the Voyages...*]({% post_url 2026-01-29-these-are-voyages %}) before it, the "bridge" scenes---explaining the situation and (in my cynical eyes) giving the audience permission to enjoy the film, because the old stuff still sits **over there**---seemed to cap off the original timeline.  And it does follow directly from [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-06-27-unification-part-1 %}), tied directly to Spock's work with the Romulan underground.  We'll only deal with those scenes, hence not breaking this up into multiple posts even though I'll need to sit through the pretty much entire thing to get anywhere.

Anyway, at least somewhat ironic in my eyes, this attempt to completely reboot the franchise "without any of the baggage" seems to have resulted in more interest in the abandoned timeline than the new one, quickly leading to **Discovery** a few years later, and then the other seven[^B1jIOv] "third generation" shows, plus---intended as a series until its star won an Oscar and became too expensive---**Section 31**.

[^B1jIOv]:  I assume that nobody wants to consider **Scouts** "real" *Star Trek*, at least because it features totally incomprehensible writing in an almost identical script episode after episode.  Replace it with **Khan**, if you prefer, which I haven't checked out, yet.  Or bump the total.  What do I care how we count these things...?

 > **WINONA**: We can name him after your father.
 >
 > **GEORGE KIRK**: Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No, that's the worst. Let's name him after your dad. Let's call him Jim.

I know that I said that I wouldn't engage with the main part of the film, but given that we had a whole thing about it before, it seems worth comparing this explanation---and wow, does this film ever feel the need to explain *everything*; I can only imagine that some deleted scene explains why one would shorten James to Jim, too---to [**The Motion Picture**]({% post_url 2022-03-10-tmp %}) novel, where Kirk identifies James as honoring both an uncle and his mother's "first love instructor," and Tiberius a pet interest of his grandfather's.

Anyway, I'll try to pipe down.  Other people---including, honestly, the credits---have taken care of the popular music and other references.

 > **KIRK**: Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So, we've managed to eliminate all enemy ships, no one onboard was injured, and the successful rescue of the *Kobayashi Maru* crew is underway.

Rambling a bit---not really relevant to the post---so that I didn't only sign up for movie night, here, I feel the need to point out two things.

First, I don't think that the USS *Kobayashi Maru* makes any sense.  As I mentioned with [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %}), the Japanese word [*maru*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8B) (literally "circle") refers to merchant ships, and we know to look at Japanese terminology because...we recognize Kobayashi as a common Japanese family name.  The Federation gets pretty weird, but presuming that your military should have a merchant fleet seems over the line.

Second, even accounting for Kirk cheating, what about this looks like a "no-win scenario"?  Other than not showing us (the audience) outside the ship, the situation comes off as identical to almost every battle that we've seen, maybe even a bit tame.  It seems especially galling to pitch it like that, because they have a team of proctors standing around, seemingly for the purpose of keeping things moving.  Instead of escalating the attention, though, and keeping the test on track, they...stare at each other.

And second-and-a-half, if everybody knows in advance that this serves as a no-win scenario, then what does it test, exactly?  I mean, if students know that they won't and can't pass the test, by policy rather than skill, then students will either half-ass it or patiently throw every idea that they have at the problem, because it *doesn't matter* what they do, I guess unless they walk out to grab a snack.  They never "face" anything more than mild frustration as a hazing ritual.

Worse, if everybody knows about this in advance, then---think Wesley Crusher in [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %})---ambitious students would have a prepared response based on how the best students of earlier graduation years handled it.  We already know, from Kirk's approach if nothing else, that at least some students prioritize their grades to the specific lessons, like any school.

The concept does probably have a kernel of merit, mind you.  But the structure---a recognizable setup, allowing students to retake it, and so forth---makes it little more than an experience to show up for, not something that tests or teaches.  Even a follow-up essay asking what choices the student considered and why they chose what they did would make this seem much less goofy.

 > **CHEKOV**: Ensign authorization code nine-five-wictor-wictor-two
 >
 > **COMPUTER VOICE**: Authorization not recognized.

We can't really use this for any information since the timeline seems so far off in many ways, but I guess that I should thank somebody for backing up my assertion that the computers have chosen an "official" accent that it'll accept, and everyone else can conform or not get computer access.

 > **PIKE**: Avert auxiliary power from port nacelles to forward shields.

Do they maybe not know...words?

As I have mentioned before, the term [nacelle](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nacelle) refers to either the boat-like gondola on a lighter-than-air ship or streamlined outboard container on a vessel.  The *Enterprise* has nacelles---actually, we could probably quibble about whether they need a streamlined form to qualify---but it only has one on the port side, and you'd pull energy from something *in* the nacelle, not the nacelle itself.

And he definitely means divert instead of avert, right?

 > **SULU**: Olson had the charges!

Remind me to talk about this bit later...

 > **NERO**: It has happened! I watched it happen! I saw it happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen! And when I lost her, I promised myself retribution. And for twenty-five years, I planned my revenge against the Federation, and forgot what it was like to live a normal life. I did not forget the pain. That's the pain that every surviving Vulcan now shares. My purpose, Christopher, is to not simply avoid the destruction of the home that I love, but to create a Romulus that exists free of the Federation. You see, only then will she be truly saved. That is why I will destroy all the remaining Federation planets, starting with yours.

While the entire franchise will brush this line aside, it seems notable that a witness to the destruction of Romulus saw it as either caused or ignored by the Federation.  And that doesn't exactly come out of left field, considering that [**The Undiscovered Country**]({% post_url 2022-04-21-tuc %}) largely opens with an angry debate over whether the Federation should do anything about the impending destruction of the Klingon home-world.

 > **NERO**: You will give me the frequencies to disable Earth's defenses. Centaurian slugs. They latch unto your brain stem, and release a toxin that will force you to answer. Frequencies please, sir.

All that time to plan, and he needed to grab off-brand Ceti eels?  (Translation:  The writers couldn't come up with something new?)

 > **KIRK**: Stardate twenty-two fifty-eight point four two, four uh, four whatever. Acting Captain Spock has marooned me on Delta Vega, what I believe to be a violation of security protocol forty-nine point oh nine, covering the treatment of prisoners aboard as starship.

Someone might want to know that Delta Vega---whose name still doesn't make much sense, because we have a *star* named [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega), not a constellation---featured (presumably during its summer, since it seemed warmer) in [*Where No Man Has Gone Before*]({% post_url 2020-01-23-trek-no-man %}).

 > **SPOCK**: How did you find me?

Wait, did this movie actually, despite its clunky (at times borderline-illiterate) script and action-flick trappings, actually manage to sneak in a "the Romulans mirror the Federation" bit, here?  Presumably, Nero abandoned Spock here, parallel to other-Spock abandoning Kirk.

 > **SPOCK**: One hundred twenty-nine years from now, a star will explode, and threaten to destroy the galaxy. That is where I'm from, Jim. The future. The star went supernova, consuming everything in its path. I promised the Romulans that I would save their planet.  We outfitted our fastest ship. Using red matter, I would create a black hole, which would absorb the exploding star. I was en route, when the unthinkable happened. The supernova destroyed Romulus. I had little time. I had to extract the red matter, and shoot it into the supernova. As I began my return trip, I was intercepted. He called himself Nero. Last of the Romulan Empire. In my attempt to escape, both of us were pulled into the black hole. Nero went through first. He was the first to arrive. Nero spent the next twenty-five years awaiting my arrival. But what was years for Nero, was only seconds for me. I went through the black hole. Nero was waiting for me. He held me responsible for the loss of his world. He captured my vessel, and spared my life for one reason. So that I would know his pain. He beamed me here, so that I could observe his vengeance. As he was helpless to save his planet, I would be helpless to save mine. Billions of lives lost, because of me, Jim. Because, I failed.

OK, we came here for this monologue (and some of Nero), really, so let's dig in.

First, the supernova somehow threatens the entire galaxy.  Notably, we haven't seen a supernova in the Milky Way since two in fairly rapid succession centuries ago[^1GteBE], [Tycho's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho%27s_Supernova) (1572) and [Kepler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova) (1604).

[^1GteBE]:  Probably not relevant, intended, or useful in any way, but it occurs to me that, if you add about a decade to each supernova's date, it looks a heck of a lot like William Shakespeare's career, running from (roughly) 1585 to 1613.  Again, that probably doesn't help anybody or mean anything, but it seemed like an interesting enough correlation to warrant mentioning, given how often his name comes up in these posts.

Anyway, the Wikipedia article on [supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Effect_on_Earth) cites research suggesting that the most powerful such event could impact the Earth's biosphere from three thousand light years away, an impressive distance, yes, *but* the galaxy spans almost ninety thousand light years, which makes "destroy the galaxy" a hard sell, even if the assertion comes to us via mind-meld, where one assumes that Spock can't massively exaggerate the stakes.

Anyway, assuming that we wave that away, like we have all the assorted errors in (real-world) terminology---honestly, maybe Spock has faced an intellectual decline similar to what we saw in [*Sarek*]({% post_url 2023-10-05-sarek %}), given that he somehow didn't notice an important inhabited planet (where he lived, mind you) in the path of the shockwave---you'll notice that Spock all but outright confirms Nero's accusation, earlier.  If a handful of Romulan dissidents and their outside agitator scrambled to save the day and came the closest to doing so, then the Federation did nothing, even though Spock would certainly have sent word and requested help.

Oh, I suppose that I should also complain that, if you can watch the destruction of Vulcan in real time from Delta Vega, then it would need to sit in the same solar system as Vulcan.  And that seems like something that you'd want to avoid introducing into the script, since Spock introduced the "lithium cracking station" in the series pilot and didn't say *anything* about it sitting close enough to a major inhabited planet that Gary Mitchell might have endangered.  That said, the gravity from the new black hole doesn't seem to affect much on the planet, so maybe we shouldn't try to make sense of the science.

 > **COMPUTER**: Stardate twenty-three eighty-seven. Commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy.

Apparently, sometimes you can use years for stardates, sometimes.  Who knew...?

Anyway, if I have the math right, this should put the manufacture pretty close to precisely between [**Nemesis**]({% post_url 2026-01-15-nemesis-1 %}) (fifteen years after 2364 or 2379) and [*All Good Things...*]({% post_url 2025-11-13-all-good-things-1 %}) (almost twenty-five years since the entire crew worked together, implicitly the end of the series in that timeline, so 2364 + 7 + 25 = 2396).

Oh, and back to the fake science, I guess that we'll quietly ignore why anybody has a human-size blob of goo, a single drop of which creates black holes, conveniently on hand to load onto a Vulcan ship, and how that ship ended up in the hands of those Romulan dissidents.  That seems shady, right?  Everybody ignores a disaster, except that a solution lands in Spock's lap, but too late and seemingly millions of times more of what he'd need to solve the problem.

That brings us back to the destroy-the-galaxy idea, though.  If we assume that Spock hasn't exaggerated or gotten massively confused, and---this gets a lot shakier---the writers had any clue how anything works, then we have a few facts about this incident to consider.

- A seemingly impossible supernova;
- An equally improbable solution to the supernova, in the hands of the Federation, and ready to mobilize;
- The Federation does not appear on the scene;
- A Vulcan Science Academy ship, with precisely the improbable solution, makes its way to Spock on Romulus;
- Spock (attempting to avert the disaster) blames himself for failing to deploy the solution in time; and
- Nero (a witness) blames both Spock and the Federation at large for the entire incident.

No explanation fits those facts, unless I have missed something, except that the Federation *caused* the supernova deliberately so that they could stop it.  Whether they would do so as some test of the "red matter"---equivalent to the [asteroid deflection tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test) in our time---an attempt to wipe out the Romulans entirely, an attempt to threaten them with a "natural disaster" that they can rescue them from, or even showing off their new weapon that creates black holes, though, I couldn't guess.

Anyway, putting this into context on the *other* side of things, **Picard** will pick up the story of the destruction of Romulus...and then mostly put it back down.  There, they don't engage with the idea much more than showing us that once-powerful Romulans now do menial labor around the Federation as refugees.

And jumping around this project, when I suggest the possibility that the Federation could have planned to destroy Romulus, by this point, they do have something of a history, here.  Remember that, in [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}), Picard attempted genocide against the Borg, and in [*Descent*]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}), we found out that Starfleet considers Picard wrong for walking that back.  Starting in [*The Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %}), they have made it clear that synthetic life has no real civil rights in the Federation, weaving through **Voyager** and its interest in holographic rights, culminating in *Children of Mars* (**Short Treks**) and *Ouroboros* (**Prodigy**) disassembling and banning all synthetic life in retaliation for an alleged terrorist strike.  During **Deep Space Nine**, we find out that the Federation has banned genetic engineering, and made it a felony for a genetically engineered person to hold any official position.  **Deep Space Nine** will also float the possibility of infecting the Changelings with a deadly disease and using the cure as leverage in the Dominion War; **Picard** will reveal that they did so without revealing the existence of the cure, and the Changelings only survived because a defector delivered the cure to them, and oh, the Federation also captured and performed medical experiments on many Changelings in hopes of enslaving them as super-spies.  We also have one-off attempts to wipe out a species in [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}), [*Home Soil*]({% post_url 2022-09-15-home-soil %}), [*Evolution*]({% post_url 2023-05-04-evolution %}), [*Identity Crisis*]({% post_url 2024-03-07-identity-crisis %}), and arguably [*Emergence*]({% post_url 2025-10-30-emergence %}), not to mention the casual acceptance of it in [*Survivors*]({% post_url 2023-05-18-survivors %}).  Add in that they treat the surviving Romulans, even those who once had important positions, as second-class citizens, and one more attempted genocide seems well in the bounds of possibility for them...

## Alternate Timeline Opportunities

I should say that, watching through this, the film sorely tempted me to write up a post on the whole script.

My self-imposed "rules" of these posts exclude it, as you know.  The timeline seems to have changed significantly more than "Nero destroyed a ship at Kirk's birth," and even if not, definitely shows differences.  And including the earlier setting risks de-excluding **Discovery** and **Strange New Worlds**, even **Enterprise**, once the limits erode.  Therefore, I won't dig deeper, here.

However, somebody could and probably should do that work.  We see more of Earth, here, than I think that we ever do anywhere else.  And we get a strong taste of Vulcan culture that reflects a lot of what we've seen before.  It *would* make an interesting addition to what we learned about the original series, in that respect---especially comparing the pervasive sexism of the film with the frequent nods at sexism making everybody uncomfortable on the original show---if somebody wanted to do it...

## Quick Commentary

Remember that I wanted to talk about the platform landing?

I often (maybe a bit too often) talk about how much **Strange New Worlds** felt to me (while I subscribed to Paramount+) like it wanted to lay the groundwork to reboot the original series with **The Next Generation**'s utter disinterest in progressive politics.  It updates the visuals, but mostly wants us to see the patriarchal family that gets together for dinner on weekends, and doesn't really care what happens in the universe as long as they keep the family intact.  I mean, seriously, the first episode uses the [January Sixth insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack) as an example of a dark time in Earth history {% emoji thumbs up %}, *but* describes it as the result of two sides not listening to each other {% emoji profanity %}.  They go on to talk about respecting religion even if it leads to genocide, and takes a firm stand that governments can and should oppress vulnerable populations---because if they don't, then members of those populations might gain the power to stop the oppression---but that such policies need a loophole so that it doesn't inconvenience favored members of the group or their friends.

Anyway, as I go through this, it strikes me how much this film serves as the template for that show.  It hasn't directly engaged with politics---though it certainly has misogynist political positions wringing its hands over women having sex with the wrong people, the outright sexist comments, and [fridging](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fridge#Verb) Winona Ryder to move Spock's character arc along---but the entire platform sequence feels like a "Riker Away Team" set piece, but with a budget.  They set Kirk up as some legendary strategist with contingency plans inside contingency plans, and thinks *so* far outside the box that he can't even see the box, but he solves his problems by punching things.  And then they need to scrap the original plan, because they didn't consider the possibility that they gave all the necessary tools to a thrill-seeking fool.

Another thing that strikes me about this?  So much of the script feels paint-by-numbers, like they fed prior scripts into a [Markov process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)---the predecessors of Large Language Models, and likely what LLMs actually do under the covers, plus or minus some semantic calculations---and extruded out "things that *Star Trek* does."  If it doesn't explain to us how someone got their name as if it moved the story along, it wants to make sure that we know that *it* knows all the famous catchphrases and plot beats.

Actually, more than paint-by-numbers, it strikes me how much the film plays more on the show's *reputation* than how it actually worked, at least for the most part.  While it neatly pulls out the "Vulcans harm themselves by suppressing emotion," it also wants to treat Kirk like...well, like *Picard*, constantly trying to seduce women and looking for excuses to punch people, in contrast to the thoughtful character hilariously awkward and consistently terrible at seduction that we saw while paying attention.

Also, do we not want to ask whether they sent Nero even further back in time at the end?  Nobody?  OK, then.

Anyway, do you know what this *does* do extraordinarily well[^cUQJrv], that the franchise *really* should've taken on as its own?  While the music score feels obscenely repetitive---at its worst, it feels like a two-hour fugue on that one five-note motif and its "are you sure?" and "absolutely" variations, making it seem like everything has the same grim emotional valence---it goes out of its way to withhold the fanfare.  I believe that I saw an interview where the composer mentioned wanting to wait until the crew earned it, implying that the ending here functions as the cold open for the equivalent television series, and I appreciate that.

[^cUQJrv]:  I mean *other* than proving that you can recast a major franchise for a new audience and not have everybody complain that the characters look different and so destroy childhoods or something.  Granted, about half of them openly do bland impersonations of the original performers in their roles, but the rest of them make it possible to imagine many interpretations of the material.  Putting that idea in context, in four years, [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}) will have aged as much as *Where No Man Has Gone Before* had in 2009.  If it felt legitimate to have Chris Pine as Kirk in 2009, then I say that we deserve a fantastic new Jean-Luc Picard in 2030, maybe even (gasp) a *French* performer.  [Tahar Rahim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahar_Rahim) seems like the right age and has the right look, though I admittedly have never seen his work...

Compare this to **Picard**, for example, especially the third season, where they use those ten notes as almost a generic punctuation mark.  Nostalgia hit?  A character walks on screen?  Somebody succeeds at something?  Clever quip?  Roll the duh-di-DUM, like a laugh track but without the social contagion of laughter.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, we really only care about two scenes.  As such, most of my comments go to grumping about some spectacularly sloppy writing, rather than much in-universe.  But I still think that it warranted the attention, especially if this series of posts manages to continue on to the twenty-first century shows.

### The Bad

Romulans blame the destruction of their home by supernova on the Federation, and Spock's account of the incident seems to support at least something like that.  They definitely had a solution to provide Spock with, but took no action themselves.  Reading between the lines, Spock gives the impression that the Federation caused the supernova.

### The Weird

Stardates have returned to making no sense.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back next week, when we summarize what we have learned about the Federation through a bit more than four films and half a rogue episode.  Then, on the nineteenth, we'll pull together a final **Next Generation** summary, which---as with the [original cast summary]({% post_url 2022-05-05-films %})---will probably talk in broader strokes, work less formally, and give me an excuse to talk about my impressions of it all.

After that, on the twenty-sixth, come back as somebody finally tells off Picard in the first half of *Emissary*, as we finally kick off **Deep Space Nine**.  That feels like a personal victory for me, since it means that I can go back to enjoying the "watch the episode" part of this process, instead of slogging through that and doing my best to still rescue the post...unless we discover that I only remember it fondly because Avery Brooks's performance delights me.
