All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Thine Own Self

Since the last post, over on **Deep Space Nine**, Sisko and O'Brien stumbled their way into a separatist movement (featuring an impressive guest-cast) in *Paradise*.

This episode, meanwhile, I think that I've always had in the back of my mind for these posts, if only because one key line that has stuck with me for decades...

Oh, and I should probably mention that the title comes from **Hamlet**, act I, scene III, Polonius instructing Laertes, "This above all---to thine own self be true, / And it must follow, as the night the day, / Thou canst not then be false to any man."

 > Bridge Officer's log, stardate 47611.2. Doctor Beverly Crusher reporting. We have rendezvoused with Counselor Troi's shuttle-craft. She has just returned from a three-day class reunion on Starbase two-three-one.

The only time that Troi has talked about her past, other than her immediate family or her relationship with Riker, has limited itself to acknowledging the presence of other people at college in [*Tin Man*]({% post_url 2023-09-14-tin-man %}), so I suppose that it makes some sense for her one social event not related to her immediate family or Riker involves a class reunion...

 > **TROI**: Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect to find anyone up except Data.

Wait, does the *Enterprise* have shifts where any don't assign anybody with authority, assuming that maybe Data will sit around rehearsing the appearance of sleepiness or some similarly tedious nonsense?

 > **CRUSHER**: I volunteered tonight. I like to put in a little bridge time now and then, stay on top of operations, tactical procedures. The truth is, I like it. It's not every doctor who gets to command a starship, even if it is the night shift.

As far as we know, Crusher first took command during [*Descent*]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}), seemingly as a last resort, even though she did a fairly good job with almost no crew under emergency conditions.

 > **TROI**: May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become a Commander? I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be Chief Medical Officer, so why put yourself through all the extra work?

Notice that, once again, they talk about work as if they constantly feel so stressed out, with their busy poker-playing, day-drinking schedule...

 > **TROI**: You know, this is a much better way of communicating for you. It's far less confusing than the way you normally speak.

I also envision far fewer sexual harassment lawsuits.  They should've given it a shot.  After all, I remember more than one person at the time pointing out that the trombone stands as Riker's only real interesting trait, especially in an era---in our world, I mean---where the popularity of [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_G) and similar artists, not to mention [Bill Clinton's notoriety](https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/Family/html/inauguration1993.html) for his own (admittedly limited) musical skill, abruptly made saxophones the default musical instrument for jazz.

 > **RIKER**: Did you come here for something in particular, or just general Riker-bashing?

...Wait, have we had that option for six-and-a-half years?

 > **TROI**: A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month, talking with Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion.

For us, "last month" equates to [*Lower Decks*]({% post_url 2025-09-04-lower-decks %}), which they didn't appear to take particularly seriously, and by the way, ended in the death of a colleague who they all seemed to care about, but Troi somehow managed to make it about her.  And related, note that her three big inciting factors all focus on other people getting promotions, going back to that obsession with competitive status that we see so often.  She wants a promotion, because she has seen other people ahead of her.

 > **TROI**: Do you remember when the *Enterprise* hit that quantum filament, and I was in command on the Bridge?

She refers to the aptly titled [*Disaster*]({% post_url 2024-06-13-disaster %}), if she thinks that she did any leading...

 > **TROI**: Well, when that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was over I realized that a part of me missed it. Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I felt like I was exploring a whole new side of myself. Not that I want to give up counseling by any means, but I really would like to stretch myself a little.

I'd like to remind everybody how that episode went down, since she brings it up.  After the plot device made a mess of the ship, Troi "took command" by having everybody repeatedly explain how the ship works to her, while she put off making a decision.  And her "big leadership moment" came when she angrily shouted over one of her reports because they made valid points that she didn't want to consider.

 > **TROI**: And I'm a pretty good student.

I'll also remind everybody, here, that in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}) she all but explicitly said that she doesn't actually know anything about her job, because her empathic abilities do all the work for her.

 > **TALUR**: Remarkable set of teeth. Breath smells like, well, it doesn't have any smell, actually. You can close your mouth. Let's see. Heartbeat sounds a little odd, but seems very regular. Skin feels clammy, but you say you feel fine?

You may recognize Talur as [Ronnie Claire Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Claire_Edwards), probably mostly from her role as Corabeth on **The Waltons**.

 > **SKORAN**: You, Ice man, where'd you find this?

Less of a big deal than Talur, but you might recognize Skoran as [Mike Hagerty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hagerty), whose career started in improv comedy and passed through many big sitcoms.  We actually saw him as Captain Larg in [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-02-redemption %}), though I didn't realize then that we'd see him again.

 > **GIA**: She died about a year ago. Father says she went to a beautiful place where everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other, and no one ever gets sick. Do you think there's really a place like that?
 >
 > **DATA**: Yes. I do.

Did they really try to convince us that these hateful warmongers fit Gia's description?

 > **RIKER**: I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
 >
 > **TROI**: Why not? What kind of a test is this?

Have I imagined it, or do all Starfleet tests involve forcing the candidate or student to keep repeating traumatizing experiences until they either give up or do something ghoulish?  Compare this test to Wesley's entrance exam in [*Coming of Age*]({% post_url 2022-09-22-coming-age %})---not to mention the test at the start of [**The Wrath of Khan**]({% post_url 2022-03-24-twok %})---that involved making sure that the candidate has the capacity to let people die.

And they seem to always do this in *secret* tests, where the candidate can't know what the test measures.  And...how does that scale?

Searching around the Internet, I see that various people have taken stated size estimates of the Federation, speed charts, and deployment sizes during emergencies such as [*Redemption*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}), to estimate that this era of Starfleet's operations involves at least a few thousand ships---to a maximum of a hundred thousand, if we judge by ship numbers seen over the next decade---where we can guess that they probably average a couple of hundred officers each.  Add in the probably hundreds of stationary facilities, space stations and planetary outposts, and Starfleet could have millions of officers distributed across the galaxy.

The ratio that we see on the *Enterprise* seems like a low lower-bound of officers who would have taken this command test, five or six (they let Data command a ship during *Redemption*, but he didn't get a promotion) command-level officers out of a thousand officers and civilians, which if we scale up to a million officers, suggests at least five thousand who have passed this test, plus presumably a larger number of them who failed.  When I ask how this scales, then, I mean how does the organization prevent maybe tens of thousands of people---many probably bitter from their rejections---from revealing the big secret?  How do you maintain this big a conspiracy?  That seems especially difficult when the secret involves forcing people to endure a traumatic experience, which feels like a *huge* scandal waiting to happen.

 > **TALUR**: Rock, fire, sky, and water are the basic elements of the universe. They can be found in every object, every person, every animal, everything. The rock in this wood can be felt by its weight and by its hardness. If we expose the wood to flame, we can encourage the fire within the wood to show itself. We can also see smoke, which is a part of the sky. The water in wood is difficult to see. Sometimes the elements are buried deep within the objects, but the four elements are always there. Yes, Jayden?

It seems worth mentioning the similarity of Talur's scheme to the Western version of the [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element), and the writers might have actually lifted a lot of this line---amending earth to rock and air to sky---from [**The Sceptical Chymist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sceptical_Chymist) (1661).  I don't quote it, but Talur will also make a couple of comments that sound inspired by the [four humors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism), as well.

Normally, I wouldn't concern myself with some non-Federation culture's fictional science.  However, it seems worth it for a couple of reasons.

- I might as well educate those of you who haven't seen this before.
- This similarity to some, though not remotely all, Earth cultures *might* give some insight as to what Picard thinks that he means by not interfering in natural development.
- The swapped-out terms might imply that these people speak English, rather than having their language translated for Data's (and our) benefit.

Also, these outmoded element/humor systems calls to mind the related proto-science [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy), which brings us back to this show's New Age influence.  You might not see that as necessarily following, but consider how, especially in a show like this, this episode could---but didn't, thank you, writers---have precipitously slid into trying to compare the four elements to the four states of matter, or the similarly tiny number of (so-far) elemental particles in the current [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of particle physics and passing it off as "returning to ancient wisdom."

 > **DATA**: I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying objects and phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical evidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire simply because it is combustible, nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood, like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of different chemical compounds, none of which is fire.

Apparently, he has core programming to act like this, and it doesn't come from learned behavior.

 > **DATA**: With an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens, this instrument will have a higher effective magnification.

Seriously?  All that planning, and he came up with, "if you make better tools, they'll work better"?

 > **RIKER**: Deanna, this is nothing personal. Not everyone is cut out to be a Bridge Officer. I don't think this is for you.

Look, I don't necessarily want to make a case of this---since the episode, for one of the first times in the series, at least *tries* to gesture in a vaguely feminist direction without trying to condemn it---not to mention the general optics of what I'll say next, but...I agree with Riker, here. {% emoji face screaming in fear %} Or rather, he frames this as an inherent capability issue, and I don't agree with *that*, because people can learn whatever they want to dedicate their time to doing, but I certainly agree that some people can't muster the sustained interest required to follow through on some decisions, especially when they make those decisions due to jealousy of their peers' achievements, rather than some internal motivation.  And it seems more than a bit obnoxious that Troi largely makes it through because she has her name in the credits...and the big reason that I'll mention in a bit, because it feels like this episode would have had more impact if Troi had failed because she doesn't take it seriously.

 > **TROI**: Why? Because I'm not the most technically minded person on the ship? I may have trouble telling the difference between a plasma conduit and a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officer than memorizing technical manuals.

OK, since this series aired, two lines have stuck with me for the intervening decades, for almost opposite reasons.

First, at the midpoint of [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), Picard announces that they'll ignore Q, because "if we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are."  And as much as I hate the idea of anybody ever using Picard as a role-model, that idea has influenced a lot of what I've done over the years, because I find it an excellent guideline.  People will judge us no matter what, so we might as well let them judge us on the version that takes the least effort to present, and I suppose that an episode named *Thine Own Self* makes as good a time as any to mention that.

Second, I have Troi's line, here.  She says, in a tone that doesn't suggest exaggeration or joking, that she can't tell the difference between two imaginary things.  And while I get the point, and neither really exists, her choices of example have always nagged at me, because definitions should show you the difference.  A "plasma conduit" probably looks a lot like a pipe, because what *else* would a (permanent) conduit look like?  And an inducer pushes...probably ionized plasma down a conduit, in her case.  This doesn't require "memorizing technical manuals"[^1], only common vocabulary.

[^1]:  I won't bother to pull it off the shelf to confirm, but ironically and in a massive missed opportunity, I don't believe that the **Star Trek:  The Next Generation Technical Manual** shows or describes either device.  On the other hand, I haven't looked at it in decades.  Anyway, I bring this up to underscore the fact that nobody needs to memorize the manual to figure this out.  In the case of licensed merchandise, it wouldn't even help...

And sure, *maybe* they all use this idiom casually, the science fiction version of someone "not knowing his ass from his elbow"---not that your elbow should fit any healthy analogy to an inducer, mind you---but we haven't heard it before or since, substantially improving the odds that Troi got that answer wrong on a multiple choice test.  And this fits with the aforementioned *Disaster*, where (on a tight deadline) she asks O'Brien what it means for them if their engine has a containment breach, as if she has never heard the term on a show where that threat constantly arises and endangers their lives.

 > **TROI**: That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I'd order someone to their death.
 >
 > **RIKER**: That's right.

Starfleet really *loves* this game, don't they...?

Also, she cheated on the test after he enabled her, no?  Riker's line that he didn't think that Troi would let the test go seems to deny that he gave her the answer, but he emphasized the keywords so sharply that either the director didn't trust us to understand how Troi figured it out, or he corrected her answer for her.

I asked above how Starfleet could possibly convince thousands of candidates to stay silent about the nature of this final test, and it definitely leaked out, here.  Does this rate as an ethical breach hanging over their heads for the rest of their careers---that Troi now holds an illegitimate rank, and Riker biased the results to help his ex-girlfriend---or does Starfleet keep candidates quiet *by* cheating and holding that illegitimacy over everybody's heads?

 > **DATA**: I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth.

It seems worth mentioning that Data has recreated a minimal [spinthariscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinthariscope), credited to William Crookes in 1903, and common enough that you may have seen or performed exactly this experiment in a chemistry class or even owned a version of the sealed device produced as a toy.  If you care about this sort of thing, this strongly suggests that the metal fragments emit [alpha radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle), particles consisting of two protons and two neutrons[^2].

[^2]:  For comparison, beta radiation consists of high-speed electrons (or positrons), which generally does less damage but therefore can penetrate deeper into objects.  Gamma radiation consists of electromagnetic radiation, often the shortest wavelengths/highest energy photons, which can penetrate extremely deep, but has a relatively lower and less reliable chance of doing any damage, with shockingly few documented instances of exposure victims Hulking out.  Oh, and earlier this week, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope managed to catch a [new kind of gamma ray explosion](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2514/), if you'd like real news related to space...

It does call into question that huge, theatrical storage box, though.  Alpha radiation absolutely poses a serious danger, *but* we also use it---emitted by plutonium-238, for the most part---to power space probes, where two and a half millimeters of lead shielding keeps it all safe.  And lesser emitters such as americium-241 and polonium-210, we have in ordinary household devices that we keep safe by...pretty much asking people not to lick the smoke detector's innards.

Yes, they may have used a source of alpha radiation so strong that the mitigation strategy for plutonium wouldn't suffice, but then Data would have needed to worry about dumping a [critical mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass) of the metal---the point where each alpha particle has a high chance of colliding with an unstable atomic nucleus, causing it to emit more alpha particles---into the same box, which would turn said box into a crude atomic weapon.  And we know that it weighs quite a bit from when the locals tried to lift the box.  For reference, it looks like californium-252 has the lowest critical mass of less than three kilograms, and berkelium-249 tops the chart with a critical mass of almost two hundred kilograms, though the numbers increase if you don't have it packaged into a neat sphere.

For completeness, I should also probably mention the [Radium Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls) who painted radium-based luminescent paint onto watches, in facilities where the owners knew that this posed hazards from the alpha radiation, but still instructed the women to bring their paint brushes to a fine point with their mouths anyway, because rags and water would cut slightly into their healthy profits.  And then the companies tried to destroy the reputations of the women when they went public with their radiation poisoning.

 > **DATA**: Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may be diluted, but it should still have enough potency to work.

Given this episode's interest in early European science, I can't help seeing this as inverting [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow)'s tracking a London cholera outbreak to a public water pump, here using the common water supply as a vector for medication instead of germs.

 > **GIA**: There were these pieces of metal. They made everyone sick. But Jayden put something in the water and now everyone's better.

They should've had an extra episode with forty minutes of Picard yelling at Data for violating the Prime Directive by not letting people die after endangering them.  He did, after all, introduce at least microscopes, a precursor to the Geiger counters, and epidemiology to a Medieval-coded culture, on top of saving lives...

 > **TROI**: That's right. Which means from now on you can call me sir.

In case, before, you thought that I exaggerated when I read craving power and status into Troi's *stated* motivation for missing the feeling of commanding, she immediately lords her power over Data.

## Conclusions

My digressions actually take up most of this post, so it doesn't leave us with much.

### The Bad

Half the episode, at least, centers on the obsession with status that we've noted before.  Troi wanted her promotion, because she sees other people passing her.  They also still seem to dislike their jobs, questioning why anybody would take a position involving more work.

Once again, Starfleet puts candidates through secretive, traumatic tests for advancement, this time making officers prove that they'll order a colleague to their death without prompting.  But despite the secrecy, they audit the tests so little that people feel free to cheat.

Related to both of these, we see the continued anti-intellectual trend, where certain people find it outright objectionable to need to know how things work.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we need to sacrifice yet another episode to Brent Spiner doing silly voices, in *Masks*.
