* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

This week, I want to talk a bit about the nature of Free Culture, media consumption, and how we might combine different ideas to create something original, if not necessarily exclusive, to the movement, if we had the resources and motivation.

Before we dig into that, though, let's give this post some broader context...

## Thirty Million Dollar Preface

Back in January, a group of Silicon Valley folks launched their [Free Our Feeds <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i>](https://freeourfeeds.com/) campaign, a buzzword-laden, [shady-looking](https://tante.cc/2025/01/13/but-does-it-free-our-feeds/) initiative that aims to raise anywhere between four and thirty million dollars, forecasting an eventual need for *hundreds* of millions, to create a foundation that would attempt building a second server ("relay") for Bluesky's AT protocol, and *maybe* create some other applications using the protocol.

You could---as the second link does---ask what makes this different from Bluesky Public Benefit Corporation.  You could ask why it takes millions of dollars to create (not run) a social media server that only follows an existing protocol, and [Bluesky already releases source code](https://github.com/bluesky-social).  Heck, you could even ask (as I did in a comment on that post) why they seem to entirely ignore Christine Lemmer-Webber's [post about Bluesky's potential decentralization](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/) in their plan, which seems to suggest that they might not get too far.  Other questions arise, too.  Why bother lavishing so much attention on AT, when ActivityPub already does more than they want?  Why do so many of their nine "custodians" have deep connections to LLM startups?  Couldn't those nine custodians, mostly wealthy in their own right, scrape up their "minimum" of four million dollars between them, if this project strikes them as so important?  Do they think that anybody will support this because Mark Ruffalo---owning assets worth tens of millions in his own right---signed their open letter?

Me, though?  I'd rather ask how one raises thirty million dollars and, if somebody wanted to give me that kind of money, what I could accomplish with it primarily relating to and supporting Free Culture.  That leads me to the second of these [thirty million dollar](/blog/tag/30-million) posts, an irregular, occasional series where I---ideally *we*, but I realize that getting involved feels like it takes commitment---think through some in-an-ideal-world projects, at least partly for entertainment purposes.  But in an *ideal* (and redundant) ideal world, I also hope that somebody might point out that, as a community, we could do this all at minimal cost and go kick off the project.

OK, in an even-better-than-ideal world, I wouldn't turn thirty million dollars down to make these things happen with your paid help.  That doesn't seem particularly likely, though.  But call me {% emoji telephone receiver %} with offers...

In short, think of these posts as somewhere between a laugh at the small imaginations/high costs of the modern software industry and wishful thinking of the things that we could have with enough resources.

Next up?  Using the principles of Free Culture to reimagine serial entertainment as something for communities.

## Media Mix-Ups

A long time ago, it started to bother---not quite the right word, but as good a word as any, I suppose---me a bit that the major studios don't seem to always understand the various media that they work in.  Plays get haphazardly adapted to film as if the projection screen works exactly like a stage.  Films get split into multiple parts released in serialized installments, or structure themselves primarily to encourage you to watch the next installment.  Television shows now pitch themselves as "like a twelve-hour movie."  It doesn't anger me, because I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the alternate-reality version of those sorts of releases either, but it does strike me as peculiar and at least partly wrong.

More peculiar to me, though, no production team seems willing to "close the loop" on this awkward cross-pollination, and this project would attempt to fill that gap---maybe the most natural gap to close---while also (in theory) showcasing the most important aspects of Free Culture to a wide audience and maybe even helping communities revitalize their downtown areas.  Ready?

### The Weekly Series

In this scenario, assuming that we had the time and money, we could create the equivalent of a weekly television series, drama or comedy, whatever genre.  But critically, the series would only take place on a single set, never (or rarely) seeing characters outside this one space.  And more importantly, we would distribute the series *not* as recorded video, but through small theater companies around the world, each making changes that they think improve the stories and contributing those ideas back for other communities to run with.

Could somebody film and distribute it as video?  Sure, as Free Culture, they certainly have that blanket permission, but that doesn't necessarily take away from the concept, where "television" becomes a community activity, where you could watch the latest episode on YouTube or wherever, but you could also make it part of a night out supporting your friends and neighbors.  And my way still works even if the power and Internet goes out...

### Possible Inspirations

How might a series like this look?  For models in past television, you might think of a model along the lines of [**Barney Miller**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Miller)---which largely inspired this idea---or, to a lesser extent, roughly contemporary [**Taxi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_%28TV_series%29)[^1], shows that rarely leave their main set, but recurring and guest characters, not to mention the storytelling itself, keep the premise relatively fresh.  But this broad premise could work for a wide variety of stories.

[^1]:  **Taxi** would make more sense with two sets, the main set where the cast waits for fares, and the cab(s) where the lead characters have "solo adventures," but I present the idea mostly for the former aspect of the characters sitting around the garage waiting for dispatching.

I have also heard that the various improv-heavy sitcoms---somebody once mentioned [**Bob's Burgers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers) to me in a similar context---do something vaguely like this when the cast tours.  They don't rig up any sets or props, but will apparently often go through scenes and riff on them with audience feedback.

Maybe the show takes place in the control room of a frontier space station, deciding how to manage crises while rarely seen teams carry out their orders.  A nineteenth-century French salon could have the cast argue philosophical or literary topics.  Or stretching the idea of a single set to its limits, on an eighteenth-century cargo ship, maybe the crew needs to uncover a murderer in their midst before they arrive at their destination or more victims pile up.  A diner or convenience store might focus on the family that owns it and their regular customers[^2].

[^2]:  I suppose that the convenience store and diner shows already do exist.

Or this could go into even weirder places, like a small office where the staff "processes" the recently deceased to determine where to route their souls, or a solar system where planets interact.  Both Free Culture and low-budget theater feel like spaces where experimentation pays off well, taking on concepts that would never "sell" to a mainstream market.

Regardless, you get the idea.

### Back to That Structure

As you might guess, I chose the structure of a single-set, single-act play deliberately, both for the interesting constraints that it puts on the storytelling and the way that it can fit into the "fringes" of more routine theatrical work.  At times when a stage would otherwise go mostly unused at a local theater, performers not involved in a "big" upcoming production can rely on a single, unchanging set, grab the next script (or any script, for an episodic show), modify it for their cast and community if necessary, and sell tickets for a small show whose audience will---we all hope---return every week for the next few months.  And don't forget about the possibility of re-envisioning reruns, where the show can try to attract a wider audience *and* performers can try to refine the presentations based on prior audience response, by revisiting the most popular episodes.

We could even take this a step further, creating multiple shows, so that more ambitious or more populous theater companies---think schools, where they might have many willing students available, enough to cover multiple productions, and enough competition that some might feel slighted at not getting a good part elsewhere---could run an entire [Don't Think, Just Laugh](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/Don't_Think,_Just_Laugh.html)-style programming block[^3], with multiple shows per weekly session.

[^3]:  I actually spent some time trying to invent a name for the programming block, trying to make "Peer Pressure Programming" work, until I realized that somebody had done the CC BY 3.0-licensed work for me at late, lamented Fictopedia.  In case anybody wants something catchier, I also tried out and discarded "Shut up, It's on," but it felt like too many prepositions to work in print.

The idea of communally watching (something similar to) a television show might seem unlikely to a lot of readers, but I'll point out that, when I went to college, the first-year student dorm had a large-screen television in the common room.  Not only did we residents congregate for a lot, as you'd expect, but non-residents would join us for the bigger shows, particularly the *Star Trek* of the day---I did go to an engineering school, after all...---and [**Batman:  The Animated Series**](Batman: The Animated Series), and presumably similar things happened at other schools.  And don't forget that so many people go to bars to watch sports on communal televisions that capitalism invented an entire category of bar to, well, capitalize on it.

In other words, people *do* go out to watch television, so it shouldn't stretch much to get an audience.

### Getting More

I have to admit that, when I look for new projects, I often try to find paths through that solve other problems along the way.  Cues for that come from endeavors such as space exploration, where (except to a few weird fanatics) the actual space travel provides the least value from the investment.  Along the way, you need to do far more interesting work, such as maximizing energy during a long trip, dealing more effectively with collisions, keeping humans and other creatures alive in hostile environments, dealing with crises when even a "wow, that sounds bad" response could take a significant amount of time, and more.  By contrast, planting a flag so that we can ramble more about [Manifest Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny) but in space?  That kind of feels like a snoozer.

Anyway, like the [Free Culture schooling](2025-05-04-30m-free-education) idea that I floated in May, I can't help seeing connections that could solve other problems.  In fact, we can start *with* schooling.

Probably around the world, but at least in the United States, we've had a terrible few decades scraping up funding for the arts, especially in schools.  We've cut art, music, and associated classes out of the curriculum as inessential, shunting them to after-school activities.  And we didn't have much interest in spending money on that, either, because it apparently makes no sense to fund things outside the curriculum.

I won't pretend that this sort of project would completely solve that.  However, I will point out that a series of plays provides a multidisciplinary project that can accommodate the work of many people, and arguably whatever work they care to offer.  If you write, paint, sculpt, record video, play music, act, or almost anything else, you could contribute.  And related, this project could pay for itself, through various combinations of ticket sales and advertising[^4].

[^4]:  I know; I hate advertising, too.  However, a local company sponsoring a show in its own community makes a lot more sense than a television commercial, and it has precedent in other student ventures, such as school newspapers and yearbooks.

Necessity could also encourage writers.  Consider, for example, a situation where a significant performer can't make it to a performance.  You could recast them for the night, as a typical stage play would.  But on a Free Culture project, you also have the option to rewrite the relevant scenes to work around the missing character, contributing that back, so that the community now has a branching narrative that can adapt to different requirements, both with and without impacting the story.  The characters, as Free Culture creations, could also spin off into their own stories to distribute.  Or even lists of props and other set elements that a group could reuse between shows could help, simplifying productions elsewhere.

Beyond schools, many towns run a summer concert series or something like it, both to give back to the community and to bring people into town where they might shop or buy dinner nearby.  This can extend that, possibly targeting different parts of the downtown or different towns.

And that doesn't even get to the value in diverting people away from *consuming* mainstream entertainment and towards independent works that they can make their own.  Nor does it get into making Free Culture *literally* approachable for "the masses" by putting it where they might actually find it instead of hoping that something will magically inspire them to seek us out.

## Wrapping Up

Admittedly, this does have some obstacles to actually taking off, even if we had people producing at every step in the process.  Even if nothing else, getting such a show in front of people, so that they might take a chance on one installment of a long-running series seems more difficult, when we've spent decades training them that they can leave the television on and passively watch whatever shows up.  Likewise, I imagine that actually writing such a series takes more effort than me hypothesizing half a dozen premises.  And we have no infrastructure for distributing the episodes, keeping them in context, providing support to groups producing them, and so forth.

And once again, I have no actual intention of taking this project on, much as I'd love to.  Alone, I'd never finish in my lifetime, at least not if we wanted something with any level of quality.  With a bunch of talented volunteers, it could happen, but I'd feel guilty for that many people not getting material support for their altruism and labor.  But if somebody wanted to throw a few million dollars my way, I could probably make it happen...

And heck, as long as we've gone down the road of joking about giving me money, I might as well quietly remind anybody making it down this far---and thank you for enduring this goofy idea for a series of posts---that you could throw me *significantly* less than thirty million dollars through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jcolag/), or even [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/dR614J5vM8na9eU9AA) directly, if you so desired, and it will go directly to manifesting wild ideas. {% emoji person shrugging %}

I really only add those because the topic turned to paying me for things.  Please, nobody feel obliged.  And if you want to provide a symbolic, non-financial contribution to this hypothetical project, pitch me your ideas for an ongoing stage series, either down in the comments or over in [the blog's Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#entropy-arbitrage:matrix.org), as long as you can keep it to a single set and a mostly stable cast.  I tossed off the afterlife-agency idea as a joking example, but it has grown on my since I wrote it, so any idea could work...
