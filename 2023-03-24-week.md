As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > We browse the internet every day and many people are on social media platforms, but we often forget that it‚Äôs people that are responsible for keeping our information ecosystems alive.

As we see a resurgence in independent social media, a lot of people will need to learn this lesson.

 > It is an interesting manifestation of the attitude of certain public critics toward change, that when the collegiate training of women was first on trial there were clamorous complaints that the health of young women was being wrecked; now the same class of public critics are loudly complaining that college women are "Amazons."

 > Last year, Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri warned those who fail to fast in public will be liable to be punished.

Hashtags:  #Iran #Norwuz #Ramadan

Given that the Iranian protests still haven't ended, this has the makings of a disaster for somebody.  At the best of times, telling people to abandon traditional holidays never works, hence Christianity appropriating major pagan holidays as Easter and Christmas, but with a population already fed up with the "Islamic Republic" premise, this might end in widespread violence from a weak government lashing out.

 > ...health care workers can face many other work stressors, such as exposure to infectious diseases and chemical hazards, bullying and violence, high physical workloads and time pressure.

Hashtags:  #Sleep #Healthcare #Health

And yes, we have a self-serving motivation in preventing these problems, since health care workers who need to deal with their own issues have less of an ability to help the rest of the population.

I admittedly find it uncomfortable to complain about Homeland Security, because I've had the experience that going down that road bears a lot of responsibility for the broader anti-government sentiment among progressives, leading them to support any politician who mentions the defense budget.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > At the time of the application, she needed hormone replacement therapy, the queue for which in the Netherlands, as Khina was informed, was long, with the approximate waiting period of over two years. The burden of accumulated problems turned out to be unbearable for Khina, resulting in tragedy.

We, as a society, need to take these sorts of issues more seriously, *especially* when dealing with refugees.
