As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "And over here, we have...the Roman numeral for four, I guess.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > In 1716, Onesimus informed Mather that he had survived smallpox and no longer feared contagion. He described a practice known as variolation derived by West Africans to fight various infections.

This does a good job---though the article never *says* it---of showing that all these worries about "Black history" really come from upending the idea that Black people have no value unless white people control them.  Without that Tarzan-like premise, then "kindly" [white families can't exploit teenagers](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/15/1193809048/the-blind-side-michael-oher-adoption) and have the country treat them, rather than the teenagers, like the protagonists.  Without it, a certain variety of politician can't try to justify police violence in certain neighborhoods as stopping "Black-on-Black crime."

When people talk about dividing up a country (the United States, most often today, but possibly India again over the next few years) because of some schism in society, that looks like this, industrialized ethnic cleansing accompanied by personal violence from people who don't see the solution as sufficiently complete.  We form pluralistic democracies to *avoid* this sort of nonsense, and should stop taking people seriously when they want their political platform to revolve around hatred or disenfranchisement.

Despite my general interest in the premise, this article actually hits on one of my oldest pet peeves when someone talks about philanthropy and other humanitarian work:  It means standing people who feed millions of people next to people who donate a few thousand dollars into scholarships...

 > Expelling blood from the body through menstruation was believed to be a natural way for women to cleanse these toxins from the body. It was considered a form of ‚Äòpurgation‚Äô, which prevented women from being consumed by their inherent sin and corruption.

I feel like that makes this time for [my favorite commercial <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpy75q2DDow), because I don't think that I could ever skewer the absurd fear of menstruation better than they did about a decade ago.

While this particular case happens to have occurred in the UK, I imagine that it doesn't much matter where you live whether this happens near you.  A *lot* of modern law enforcement theory comes down to wanting the ability to convict currently innocent people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, of future crimes.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/open-ai-fake.jpg|The head of Tux the Linux mascot, with glowing red eyes presumably based on the HAL-9000, set in front of columns of green-colored text|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> ["Open" "AI" isn't](https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/18/openwashing/#you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means) from Pluralistic

 > Today's tech giants have mobilized "open" to create a two-tier system: the largest tech firms enjoy broad freedom themselves ‚Äì they alone get to decide how their software stack is configured. But for all of us who rely on that (increasingly unavoidable) software stack, all we have is "open": the ability to peer inside that software and see how it works, and perhaps suggest improvements to it.

This gets impressively deep into why we care about licensing, despite so many pundits insisting that "the war ended" and we should stop complaining about people want to publish "open source, but only for personal use" (or similar) software.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Likable or memorable? How to create slogans](https://www.futurity.org/how-to-create-slogans-2959522-2/) from Futurity

Longer and using uncommon words?  I think that I might have found my calling, everyone...
