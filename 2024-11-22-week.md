As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > What‚Äôs more, authors of color ‚Äì particularly women of color ‚Äì were far more likely to be banned compared with white authors.

I assume that it surprises absolutely nobody that conservative-led bans focus on erasing the people that they want to erase, but having data to back it up always helps.

 > Despite the data being clear that British nationals are most at risk of being exploited, the former government continued with its framing of modern slavery as an immigration, not a safeguarding, issue.

Hashtags:  #Trafficking

I don't typically pay much attention to UK news, but I think that we can all see how this type of fact-free policy might spread quickly to other countries.

[<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Quoted on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/113510702304572248)

 > The legislation of the government has been directed rather to the protection of the rights of money and property than to the best good of the citizen.

 > The results demonstrate that the older the participants are, the more skillful they become during the early stages of training. This suggests that they get more out of the task introduction.

Hashtags:  #Aging #Education

I've often suspected that younger people *seem* to learn faster, because they don't care about the consequences of getting something wrong.  I might hesitate to try something, because I might break a device or hurt myself, but for a child, that seems like somebody else's problem.

 > The extremely tight eligibility requirements for some programs don‚Äôt allow us to have more than a tiny income, any assets, or even to marry without assuming a partner will take care of us. Yet other programs also have work requirements, and we‚Äôre shamed for wanting to marry without losing our benefits.

I don't have anything to add, here.

 > Abolitionists are frequently disparaged by public officials and the media as being naive and idealistic. The people who come together to initiate abolitionist projects and collectively maintain them over the long haul, however, are often people who have a ‚Äústake‚Äù in disrupting and dismantling carceral logics and institutions.

We need more of this, I think.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > While Cyclops never materialized, exoplanet astronomers keep discovering more planets beyond our solar system, and scientists use radio telescopes to search for artificial radio signals.

Personally, I like the [Wow! signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal) better---the inspiration for Fictopedia's [47.1 Spike](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/fictopedia/47.1_Spike.html), I imagine, if you want a connection to Free Culture works---but this has its charms as well.
