I've had elements of this story kicking around for a while, but they recently came together in a way that worked for me, once I realized that the "story" ended when we tune in.

![Sunset from cliffs...though not the Cliffs of Nubejmep](/blog/assets/38668565135_5d7c797e52_o.png "From page 538...")

I won't provide much comment, this time through, but I'll drop the two references to other fiction at the bottom.

## Epilogue

Atop the Cliffs of Nubejmep, the Scion of Xibepzo watches the setting of the Sun, as a wind-less chill interrupts his ruminations.

"Thank you, Chosen One!  As the augurs foretold, you---the seventh son of the seventh daughter of the seventh House of Xibepzo---have defeated the Great Unspeakable Evil."

"Gah, you scared me half to death!  Wait, Gentleman Keyzom?  How did you survive the Conflagration of Masludkaluba?"

"Would that I did, Chosen One.  But I can only briefly part the veil during times of great import, such as the current moment, and it felt appropriate to congratulate you on fulfilling your ancient destiny, and help you through this final part of your adventure."

A pregnant pause passes, then a more awkward silence.

Finally, the Chosen One hesitantly asks, "OK, so what now?"

"What do you mean, Chosen One?"

"Well, for example, do I rule this land in place of the Missing King?"

"Your actions *freed* the Missing King---who would like everybody to call him Xan, now, given the abrupt termination of protracted absence---so that seems an unlikely choice.  And honestly, the people don't have the fondest feelings for absolute monarchism, these days."

"OK, then, do I marry the Bereft Princess?"

"That seems even less likely.  Uqiva---she does have a name, you understand---only felt Bereft on account of her father's aforementioned protracted absence.  Now that Xan has returned, she has likely finally started planning her wedding to Her Great Honor Tolcaq of Gondal."

"Oh, I didn't know..."

"Well, of course you didn't!  You spent no time getting to know her at all, but did uncomfortably try to kiss her, and now apparently fantasize that you'll marry her as some sort of prize, as if she has no autonomy of her own."

"Whatever.  Do I get *any* power, here, in the wake of my triumph?"

"You helped us remove the tyrannical outsider who controlled the kingdom for generations.  Surely, you don't think that our nation has such an infantile disposition that we would turn around and hand that same power over to some *other* foreigner, even one who helped us.  Honestly, rumors suggest that Xan will institute a bottom-up governance model to keep the Crown in check, and possibly look into transitioning his executive position to one elected by the people, rather than heredity based on alleged compacts with primordial deities.  Investing one person with ultimate power has led us far astray, you realize, and nobody seems keen on repeating that error."

"So...I don't get any reward?"

"I would think that your newfound confidence and skill would serve as sufficient reward, but perhaps Xan could scrounge up a few gavvo from the Royal Treasury before implementing democratic fiscal oversight and a modern fiat currency, or maybe he can locate a coffee mug with the royal crest from before the Great Unspeakable Evil seized control.  And the Crown will surely pay your airfare home, assuming that enough of Masludkaluba International Airport survived the Conflagration better than I did.  If not, they can probably at least get you a rail ticket to a country with infrastructure that great unspeakable evils haven't neglected for decades or destroyed in recent fiery battles, a jitney ride at the absolute worst.  And the Princess Uqiva has a graphic arts degree, so maybe she could put together some sort of attractive certifi---What?"

"It's just...I've always felt like I was meant for something important.  And I came here to *do* something important, and it can't just be over."

"Oh, kiddo, every teenage boy feels like that, and most don't have a single prophecy written about us.  I don't know if the idea will translate to that haphazard baragouin of your people, but in these benighted parts of the world, we call it patriarchy, an entire system woven into the fabric of cultures, manipulating you into enforcing its sad gender roles, by making you think that you always need to act like the protagonist of every story, such as insisting on kissing a beautiful princess without considering that she might have no interest in you at all or thinking that an occasional nice act makes you fit to lead.  And then we have white supremacy..."

"But not all men---"

"Nope.  Let me stop you right there, young one.  Yes, some men absolutely come to understand their culture's gender politics, find it objectionable, and move on from it to build something better in their lives.  Those men have made a conscious decision to question their actions to make sure that they don't harm others, and they make that decision again, every time somebody gives them the choice, because they don't like the default alternative.  As such, you technically have it right that not all men live in damaging ways, but you raised the topic of *your* behavior, and you have not made any decision to make the world better.  The work done by other men to improve the world does not excuse you, any more than *but not all humans murder each other* would excuse those who do actually commit murder."

"But I just---"

"Yes, sure, you helped my people move forward...but primarily because the Sehje Prophecy warned us of failure if we proceeded without you, and only after you whined and resisted, so you can't really call that your decision.  And if the prophecy had foretold that a rutabaga had a destiny to fell the Great Unspeakable Evil, I can assure you that we would have made do with the root vegetable, and it would have complained significantly less.  You didn't exactly *do* all that much, after all.  From what I could see from beyond the veil, the Singing Obsidian Goedendag of Kudrajiov did the overwhelming majority of the work on its own, once you delivered it to Colzelhu's Ley Nexus at the appointed hour of night within day."

"Oh.  Yeah, I suppose so, when you put it like that.  But what do I do now?"

"You should probably go home, honestly.  You probably have school to return to, friends, your parents, at least six brothers that I know about, at least six aunts, probably dozens of cousins, nieces, and nephews, maybe other siblings and uncles, depending on how much of your situation the ancient Sehje sages or their successive generations of translators and interpreters elided for the sake of concision in the prophecy.  Many of them probably miss you.  While you now know that a bigger world exists out here, and that you can handle it, you don't have a pressing responsibility for doing so, yet."

"I'll miss everybody here, though."

"That makes perfect sense, since you made some friends along the way.  And you can see them before you fly home, maybe get their e-mail addresses or...do kids your age still deal with telephone numbers?  The Regal Ministry of Signal Wards ran an IRC server for a while, but not many citizens had Internet access back then, and I doubt that the Great Unspeakable Evil kept everything running, given the potential to organize uprisings, not to mention his general philosophy on spending to maintain infrastructure, so I wouldn't rely on using it.  I believe that the mernby Xitiwtan has mentioned having a Diaspora account at some point, maybe, so you could probably start with thon, since thon did save you from the ambuscade of foul Zogiqlis.

"Regardless, my point is that this didn't happen in some alternative universe or as some scenario that retroactively overwrites the timeline.  You didn't dream it, nor did we pull you into some strange simulacrum of reality.  Everybody here really exists, living only physical distance from your parents' house, at least those of us who still *do* live, large though you may find that distance.  You can go settle back in at home, and think about the rest of your life.  And you can keep in touch with your new friends, though I don't know if your mobile plan will pierce the veil to get many messages to me, alas, even if the veil may yet thin again when the stars align.  Critically, perhaps you'll have the opportunity to mentor a Chosen One in some other part of the world, one day, as I did, after you have learned a bit about consent, social justice movements, the legacy of colonialism, and...maybe you should write some of this down, now that I think about it, because the real work begins now that you're no longer Chosen..."

* * *

As mentioned, I won't belabor this (or maybe I will), since almost every name comes from a random generator that builds everything based on syllables and the other specifics shouldn't matter too much.

Apart from a couple of real words chosen for their obscurity that you can look up on your own time, you might want to know that [Gondal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_%28fictional_country%29) comes from early and mostly unpublished work by [Emily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB) and [Anne Brontë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bront%C3%AB), and the gavvo served as the currency of Anthony Hope's [Graustark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graustark), though I thought of the gavvo's use here as similar to the dollar, the peso, the rial, or the like, a name shared by many different currencies, rather than choosing the name to set the scene in Graustark, because the specific country doesn't matter to the story, other than making them roughly European so that I didn't need to cram in mockery of the [white savior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior) trope on top of everything else.  Both sources long ago fell into the public domain due to expired copyrights.

And yes, their kingdom fell generations ago, but Xan and Uqiva haven't aged much, and the government ran an IRC server back before the conquest, even though people still use phones and e-mail.  I don't know what to tell you.  Not everything about Europe gets a mention in travel guides.  Personally, I blame a bad conversion from the metric system.

Oh, right.  Those of you who read here regularly probably already know, but for those who don't, [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) really exists as a federated---but not federated with what we generally think of as the Fediverse---social networking system.  You probably won't find Xitiwtan there, unless somebody decided to role-play thon (or if I randomly generated a name that a real person uses), but you can [find me there](https://nota.404.mn/people/e4313920967a0136074b076893c08a76), if you like, even if my land-standing and conformance to a gender binary does make me something less of a find out there than the fictional character...

Speaking of Xitiwtan, though, if anybody knows of a more appropriate noun---legitimate and used by such people, not one that you want to call them---that indicates a person of non-binary gender rather than a person of indeterminate gender, suggest it in the usual ways.  "Mernby" feels like an abject failure on my part.

OK, actually, I need to belabor this, because events have inexplicably caught up to my writing.  I started writing this months ago, around two lines.  The first line became the description of patriarchy.  The other line grew into the final paragraph about adventures ending meaning that we live only physical distance apart, which we can bridge in all sorts of ways.  Other than trying to rebuke the idea of the protagonist staying in their new context, I don't remember whether I had a specific ending in mind, though I've admittedly gone through a lot of them in my life.  I scheduled the post for today a few weeks ago, and touched it up when more appropriate (to my ears) wording came along.

However, during this past week, we learned that [Cohost will end normal operations](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down) at the end of September.  Now, that final line has a different feel to it, because the people there did form a surprisingly and impressively tight community.  And that community now parts ways, taking ideas from the site elsewhere, trying to keep in touch without a magenta-tinted central location, and so forth, not unlike the protagonist.

I don't think that I had Cohost in mind when I wrote this or when I scheduled this, but I can't complain about my timing.  To those of you finding this from Cohost, consider this an invitation to keep in touch if we haven't already started doing this.  To those of you not from Cohost, no matter your situation, periodically think about how you'll keep in touch with the people who mean something to you, if you need to part ways, because you don't want to figure that out as a deadline approaches.
