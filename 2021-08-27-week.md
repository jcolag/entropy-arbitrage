As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I dug into the reasons that right-wing social media sites aren't serious attempts [at community or business]({% post_url 2021-01-17-social-media %}) back in January, and one of the first posts on the blog was about why [social media tends to favor right-wing views]({% post_url 2019-12-20-social-media %}), so I won't go into either topic.  However, neither of the above articles should be surprising.

However, I will say that, for people obsessed with an imaginary pedophile cult, Republicans are surprisingly comfortable supporting and spending their time with pedophiles.

 > That holds true even if a child’s socioeconomic status changes before adulthood.

That's a sizeable finding, even if we don't know that there's any meaning to it.

One of the issues that convinced me that "the market will take care of everything" libertarians don't know what they're talking about is how---when you actually analyze their decisions---corporations do *not* take the most economical routes when choosing where to build a factory, for example.  Rather, they almost invariably take the option that permits them to harm more people.  There is no shareholder interest in polluting groundwater or selling a product that kills its consumers, yet somehow, those are the decisions that get made.

 > Limited access to comprehensive pain management can lead to worse outcomes for patients.

To be fair, civil lawsuits are *never* about directly changing society to prevent future victimization.  But it's still something to consider.

You're free to argue that either of the "bonus" articles are more important than whistling languages, but these edge cases always interest me.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Team solves mystery of how bacteria clean up radioactive waste](https://www.futurity.org/bacteria-radioactive-waste-2614732-2/) from Futurity

 > What Reguera discovered in 2011 was that, on one side of their cells, the Geobacter make protein filaments that act like little wires to literally zap uranium.

Considering that we're still dealing with the [Fukushima disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster) and who knows what else, information like this can be critical for both cleaning up and reducing the chances of disasters in the future.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [We have more to learn about fire](https://earthbound.report/2021/08/18/we-have-more-to-learn-about-fire/) from The Earthbound Report

 > Residents will have to learn, fire services will have to skill up. Local authorities are going to have to make new plans for vulnerable people, and understand how fire risk affects local economies.

It really says everything that you need to know about Silicon Valley that there is far more talk about how to tie the fate of cryptocurrencies---inherently [wasteful and destructive]({% post_url 2021-05-16-crypto %}) as they are---to pornography in the wake of [OnlyFans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans) eliminating the adult content that (as I understand it) makes their platform viable than there is about companies finding better solutions to wildfires that directly threaten their homes.
