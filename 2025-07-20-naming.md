* Ignore for ToC
{:toc}

As a quick preliminary note, I'll talk in this post as if it only applies to Free Culture works, but I should make it clear now that I drew all the information from public sources, so you can quickly reproduce my "findings" and apply them to any fictional work, if you need.  I'd *prefer* it if you created more Free Culture fiction, but you need to do what works for you.

And as a second note, I originally wrote a much shorter and less formal version of this post for the May 2024 issue of the [**Entropy Arbitrage** newsletter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).  I don't always write reference material over there, but I also don't always revive those pieces for the blog.  If you want to see this sort of thing---in addition to any updates to blog posts, metrics for the blog, and a list of the overwhelming majority of my media diet as soon as possible, then you could do worse than subscribe...

In computer science, we like to say that we only have one *serious* problem to solve, naming things.  And sometimes we need to worry about cache optimization.  And sure, sometimes we worry about off-by-one errors.  {% emoji snare %}

Sorry, that doesn't come across well as emoji.

Much better.

## Background

Anyway, in fiction, a similar issue can come up, at least for me.  I don't know about you, but I sometimes worry about the notional boundaries between my fiction and the constructed parts of our reality.  For example, if you read [**Seeking Refuge**]({% post_url 2019-12-14-seeking-refuge %}), my so-far-only novel, or my other writing, then you might notice that I try to avoid referring to real-world locations.  Instead, characters travel around and refer to almost a "shadow United States," places that probably sit between the borders of places that you would actually recognize.

I do things like this because---especially for Free Culture works that anybody has the power to revive, adapt, translate, or use otherwise however they might please---it provides a buffer where a hypothetical intermediary doesn't need to worry as much about the particular place or era.  And more selfishly, it means that I don't need to fuss over details of geography or culture, and don't need to worry about getting somebody angry because I said or implied unfortunate things about their neighborhood.  Nobody reading will care about what I say about San Grobiano, South Jefferson, because neither San Grobiano nor South Jefferson exist for people to live in, even if it might bear some deliberate resemblance to a real area...

I have a similar but maybe stronger problem when it comes to fictional *contact* information.  For example, I assume that I share one of my bigger pet peeves with a lot of readers, when a film or book shows or tells us that a character visits an example website, but fails to secure the equivalent of `entropyarbitrage.com`, or only hangs onto the domain for a year or so, which leads to either directing traffic to somebody who bought the domain for an unrelated reason and doesn't want the attention or allowing somebody to "squat" and reap the benefits of the production directing traffic.  Something similar goes for all sorts of contact information.

As you might guess, we part ways, here, depending on the kind of project that we have.  If you have a big budget, for example, then you can afford to buy your domain or pay for a phone line or whatever indefinitely, or at least longer than you expect your work to draw a significant audience, and deploy something useful there.  On a smaller budget, you might keep an advertising website up for a while, but not anything significant, possibly updating the release afterward to prevent people from following the link.  But for tiny-to-no budgets, we need to choose between the risk of sending someone into a bad situation or trying to quietly slip through society's cracks.

This post tries to build a framework to avoid that, by---similar to the aforementioned "shadow United States"---assembling fictional addressing schemes that won't likely find themselves used in the outside world.  If, for example, our fictional website exists at an *impossible* URL, then we never need to worry about maintaining the domain, provided that we don't need it to exist in the outside world as part of a game or advertisement.

## Telephone Numbers

We'll start in a peculiar but traditional place, calling imaginary people on the telephone.

### Quick (I Hope) Telephony Background

As a caveat, I want to point out that this information holds for most of North American and the Caribbean, but probably not anywhere else.  Starting in 1947 or gradually in the 1960s, depending on how you count, AT&T introduced the [North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan), which provides a standard for a closed (fixed-length) pattern of assigning phone numbers to subscribers by local telephone company offices.  By the NANP, everybody in country code 1 gets a ten-digit phone number, made up of a three-digit area code, sometimes called an NPA for "numbering plan area," a three-digit exchange (also called the trunk or central office) number---sometimes represented as *NNX*---and a four-digit subscriber line (sometimes station) number, sometimes represented as *NNN*, even though that implies one less digit.

Those latter distinctions don't really matter[^1], anymore, between the rise of mobile phones placing a number wherever it happens to sit, and number porting allowing people to keep their landline numbers as they relocate.  However, it helps to make intuitive sense of the format, because we understand the *concept* of an area code, and some of us might remember the local switching systems that represented exchanges.  But these days, you'll sometimes see the representation *NYX NXX-XXXX*, describing the digits that can go in each position.  *N* can represent any digit, as can *X*---now, though it previously had reserved values---except that they reserve *N11* "offices" for official services.  And *Y* can only represent digits 0--8, with 9 reserved for more future expansion like *X* before it.

[^1]:  They only ever *really* mattered behind the scenes, especially to the engineers at the telephone company.  I only know all this because one of my first jobs involved a fault-ticketing system for telephone companies, and our database had `nnx` and `nnn` fields to identify the customer.

### Some Quick Caveats

This tells us what a telephone number requires to seem credible on some level, but it doesn't tell the whole story.  But I should note that I went through all the information to say that, if you intend to work with a setting outside the NANP's territory, then you'll need to research how telephone numbers structure themselves in your area.

In addition, do you remember my calling this a "peculiar" place to start?  Well, I chose that word, because telephone numbers don't generally have much prominence in people's lives, even less so in fiction.  We did and still do exchange numbers, but either we or our devices---and I mean "device" as broadly as possible, to include a personal telephone book---commit them to memory.  You see them on advertisements and *buried* in the depths of corporate websites, but for the most part, you could get away with not showing a telephone number at all, and it wouldn't take anything away from a story, because an observer wouldn't generally expect to see them.

Most of you probably "dial" telephone numbers by tapping on a picture of a person's face, right?  And abstracted another layer in fiction, you'd almost need to introduce an excuse to mention or show an actual phone number, so most people can blissfully ignore the foregoing, even though I've made you read a few hundred words to get here.

Or in other words, I write this section for that narrow set of cases where you actually do need a telephone number, and it should fit in the North American Numbering Plan.  That said, if anybody wants to do the research for their part of the world and feed me the sections of standards to read, I'll happily update this post.

### Get on with the Telephone Numbers, Already...

OK, so we understand our problem, in that we don't want the current holder of an actual telephone number to receive unwanted calls because we gave that number to a fictional company or character in a work of fiction.  We *certainly* don't want to mark it as a fax or modem line, where that unlucky subscriber gets an earful of screeching, because somebody hopes that we left them an "Easter egg" at that number.

To solve this, we should start with the official solution that we've all probably seen, assigning every fictional number to the [555 exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_%28telephone_number%29) in their respective area codes [with a 01-prefix](https://nationalnanpa.com/number_resource_info/555_numbers.html).  Picking a random (real) area code of 586 for [Eastpointe, MI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastpointe,_Michigan), then 586-555-0100 -- 586-555-0199 gives you one hundred numbers guaranteed to never get assigned to a subscriber[^2].  And probably for all but the largest and most structured of shared fictional (but mundane enough to still use telephone numbers) universes, you can end the conversation here, because you probably won't need one hundred numbers to call in every area code.

[^2]:  Well, "guarantee" in quotes.  In prior decades, the standards bodies and companies agreed that the entire 555 exchange would never get assigned, but companies ran out of space elsewhere, so narrowed the promise.  They'll probably do it again...

It *does*, however, carry a small problem of diversity, in that the overwhelming majority of telephone numbers in the majority of fiction shares five out of ten digits, AAA-555-01NN.  But if you don't mind your fictional universe looking a bit archaic, then you can make those hundred numbers look like they *imply* a significantly larger set.  We can do this by reviving the old idea of central office (or exchange) names.

### Central Office Names

You know the names that I mean.  In songs, you have [Pennsylvania 6-5000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEnnsylvania_6-5000), [Beechwood 4-5789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechwood_4-5789), [Lonesome 7-7203](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_7-7203).  This takes the first two digits of the exchange and use the associative numbering on the telephone dials/keypads to give us the first two letters of a name, which the company and/or community uses to name that office.

![The dial of a rotary telephone](/blog/assets/Rotarydial.png "We somehow keep the letters on telephone keypads and app displays that simulate them, even though almost nobody uses the letters for anything anymore...")

In the case of our hundred fictional numbers, *55* can map to *JJ*, *JK*, *JL*, *KJ*, *KK*, *KL*, *LJ*, *LK*, or *LL*.  We look up words and names with those first two letters, ruling out the terms that probably wouldn't go over particularly well with the public (KKK, Klan) or that probably wouldn't convey well in a noisy conversation (Klee), and that gives us a list that looks something like...

 * Klaus
 * Kleenex
 * Klein
 * Kleptomania
 * Klimt
 * Klondike
 * Kludge
 * Klutz
 * Ljubljana
 * Llama
 * Llano
 * Llewellyn
 * Lloyd

You've probably heard the *Klondike-5* exchange referenced in old TV shows and movies, because **they** used the names to obscure that every number started with *555*, as well.  While I wouldn't recommend using all the names, because it makes the game apparent again if everything starts with the same letters, even taking one name for each prefix helps to disguise the numbers.  For example, *Klimt 5-0164*, *Ljubljana 5-0127*, and *Llewellyn 5-0150* look distinctive, and they sort in an order that doesn't immediately expose the small set of numbers to draw from as *555-0127*, *-50*, and *-64* do.

However, this now also opens a potential second avenue for telephone numbers, because for the majority of telephone dials and keypads, we only have twenty-four letters, three letters each associated with the digits 1--8.  If our exchanges use the letters *Q* or *Z* in the first two letters of their names, then people probably won't try to dial them[^3].

[^3]:  Yes, many phones cram the *Q* in with *7*, and the *Z* with *9*, as if it would hurt somebody's feelings to not have every letter on the dial.  As I said, feel free to stop with one hundred available numbers per area code.

I won't waste your time with the full list, but at least with the dictionary on my laptop, that gives over a thousand possible central office names.  We'd probably want to pare that list down significantly, getting rid of possessives, plurals, and verb tenses, plus abbreviations and...whatever you want to call SQLite or QWERTY.  But it looks like you get a list of name-prefixes that looks something like AQ, AZ, CZ, DZ, EQ, EZ, IQ, IZ, OZ, QA, QI, QO, QU, SQ, SZ, TZ, UZ, ZA, ZE, ZH, ZI, ZO, ZS, ZU, ZW, and ZY, for a total of twenty-seven prefixes to use to find reasonable-sounding names.  For example, ZH gets you Zhengzhou, Zhivago, and Zhukov as options, at least for my local dictionary.

Because these office names can't sensibly exist for the average telephone subscriber, this means that you can follow them with any five digits that you please.  If you want to call *Zhukov 6-5000* on most phones, then good luck to you, but the rest of us know that you cheated if you connected to anything at the other end.  Note that, with a hypothetical number for Q and/or Z, some of these exchanges still look the same numerically, such as *AZ* ("Azure," for example) and *CZ* ("Czechia"), which both map to *2Z*.  You can decide whether to care about that detail for a given work on your own time.

Either way that you decide to use this scheme, though, it provides a *lot* of numbers that you signal to your audience don't have a real-world meaning, as many as two million, seven hundred thousand (plus maybe a few hundred from the *555-01xx* numbers given different names) per area code, but never less than hundreds of thousands per area code.

### Area Codes

We can plausibly make this more interesting, because the NANP also identifies *000* through *200* as either outbound-only or invalid area codes, adding another layer preventing a fictional number from accidentally coming into use.  That means that we have two hundred (and one) area codes where nobody will ever live or work.  However, you *probably* don't want to start a number with *0*, since that'll call the operator on most phone systems.

While I wouldn't recommend separating them, if you *really* wanted to use a valid seven-digit telephone number, you could commit to always associating it with one of these non-area codes, to make it explicitly fictional.  But I prefer to think of it more as an extra layer of insulation, so that *(106) Kludge 5-0168* or *(126) Quarrel 8-2919* each has multiple levels of signals preventing somebody from dialing it.

### Country Codes

The foregoing only assumes the North American Numbering Plan, but if you want to stretch beyond country code *1*, we have some discontinued country codes.  Targets such as the American Samoa (684), ANAC satellite (858 and 878), Aruba (599 8), Dubai (978), European Telephony Numbering Space (388), Guam (671), Inmarsat Atlantic East, Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic West (871--874), International Telecommunications Public Correspondence Service (991), OCHA (888), San Marino (295), Sint Maarten (599 5), South Yemen (969), Universal Personal Telecommunications Service (878), and the Republic of Zanzibar (269) all either no longer exist or have had their telephone numbers shifted to another numbering plan.

For example, Zanzibar now comprises part of the modern nation of Tanzania, whereas the likes of Guam and Sint Maarten---for different reasons---have shifted to the NANP and country code 1.  As decommissioned country codes, however, we can probably assume that telecommunications bodies won't try to recycle them anytime soon.

Maybe notably, this allows for country codes representing fictional places in Africa (2xx), Eastern and Western (though not Central) Europe (3xx), South America (5xx), Asia-Pacific (6xx), East Asia (8xx), and West and South Asia (9xx).  Many other unassigned numbers exist in every grouping, as you might imagine, but authorities reserve them for future expansion, meaning that a new or expanding country could inherit phone calls to your imaginary country.

Again, though, most of those places don't follow the North American Numbering Plan scheme, so you'll need to do some research to make sure that your fictional telephone numbers look reasonable to the locals.

## ZIP Codes

Next, we can talk about postal addresses.  Again, I only have information on the United States, so those of you living elsewhere will need to do some research of your own.

Now, most of an address, you can make up on your own, and can't really go wrong unless you deliberately pick a real-world address.

> Send all complaints to:
>
> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave
>
> Washington, DC

Unit number, street name, city, and either state or territorial designation, you can all deal with on your own time.  However, those of you sending e-mail regularly will ask the same question.

### Whither the ZIP Code

OK, maybe you phrased the question differently.

Regardless, the [Zone Improvement Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code) hit the scene in 1963 as a way to route mail faster and more reliably.  I have benefitted from this, myself, a few times.  If the address has legibility problems, whether from the sender's handwriting or from damage to the envelope, if somebody can work out the five-digit ZIP Code, it'll at least get to the right local Post Office, where somebody has a better chance of recognizing your name.

It inexplicably never caught on with the public, but ZIP+4 gives even finer granularity to that routing, which at least early on (less so, today), represented no more than ten residences on the same side of a street.  The Post Office occasionally claimed that, if your envelope showed a known surname and the ZIP+4, then the carrier would almost certainly get the package to the right address.  The code itself would narrow the scope, and we could often rely on the carrier to know the families on their route, or at least match names to locations.

The [Intelligent Mail barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode) encodes this, when identified through optical character recognition.

This gets back to inventing a random address, though.  If you pick a random five-digit ZIP Code, it looks like the United States Postal Service currently has [forty-one thousand ZIP Codes assigned](https://facts.usps.com/42000-zip-codes/), out of a possible hundred thousand.  In other words, you have a better than half, but less than two-thirds, chance of picking an unused code.  And much like Area Codes, you never know when the Postal Service will need to assign more.

Let's try to increase the odds, then.

### Starting at the Top

When I started this research, specifically for [**The Light's Edge**](https://www.thelightsedge.com/), I only knew of one ZIP Code that wouldn't route mail to a real place.  The United States Postal Service uses the 88888 ZIP code for the North Pole, as in letters to Santa Claus.  While organizations do occasionally get and read that mail to respond to requests from children, one imagines that they discard anything addressed to the Alaskan agent of [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_holmes) or [Umvelinqangi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umvelinqangi) or whoever.  Consider it comparable to the far funnier Canadian Post Code *H0H 0H0*.

In researching, though, I discovered that the Postal Service actually uses all of *888xx* for the North Pole.  In my case, that led to the fictional Alaskan town getting bumped elsewhere in that range to look less conspicuous.

By contrast---still going with **The Light's Edge**, since I believe all this made it to the website that I linked, along with a couple of fictional telephone numbers---Fort Sheridan Army Base's not-yet-needed ZIP code would probably start with *987*, a discontinued prefix designating military bases in Japan and Alaska.  Again, similar to area codes, a discontinued ZIP code feels safer than only unassigned, because they always reserve the latter for future expansion, but probably wouldn't want the former to cause conflicts.  And the fact I actually have a fictional military base in Alaska makes it ideal.

For reference, other interesting ZIP codes include DC-area *20252* for mail to [Smokey Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Bear), *000xx* for areas with no proper addressing, discontinued *269xx* (probably from either southern West Virginia or North Carolina), and discontinued *96901* (Canton Island, Kiribati).  Again, we also have plenty of generally unassigned codes, but that increases the risk of the Postal Service assigning one of those numbers as some local population expands.  Even more than the phone numbers, I doubt that anybody will try to send physical mail to any of these fictional locations, because that requires effort.  By adding layers of fiction, though, it dramatically decreases the chances that some unwitting person will accidentally become the *recipient* of any such parcels.

## Television and Radio

As I believe that I've written elsewhere, Q-prefixes work great for American television and radio stations, such as QMAX, QIBC, or QABD, some of which I adapted from some comic book story or other that has fallen into the public domain[^4], though I believe all have since gotten assigned to real stations minus the *Q* prefix.  The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) forbids using it as a [prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_prefix), since adding it would have conflicted with telegraphy's [Q code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code).  For television and radio, the letter *Q*[^5] has the virtue in the United States of having a name that sounds a bit like *W* (the prefix used in much of the eastern United States), and the letter usually makes a sound like *K* (the western United States).

[^4]:  Unless I have it wrong in some of my oldest notes, QMAX derives from UMAX from the *Midnight* stories from Quality Comics, where UM- would mark it as a station out of Uzbekistan.  QIBC derives from IBC from the *Wonder Man* stories from Fox Comics.  And not from fiction, QABD derives from real-world WABD out of New York, once the flagship station of the [DuMont Television Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuMont_Television_Network), named for founder Allen Balcom DuMont.  For those of you who know the area, ABD became WNEW in 1958, and WNYW in 1986, a Fox Television O&O.

[^5]:  On the downside, in the United States, the letter *Q* will currently also inevitably remind people of [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) and its nonsensical conspiracy theories, but I'd rather risk that while rehabilitating a perfectly good letter of the alphabet, personally, rather than ceding that ground.  It feels like a far easier choice than using an ITU non-prefix that a political movement actually uses.

Internationally, the more useful prefixes probably include *0-*, *x0-*, *1-*, and *x1-*, where *x* represents any letter in the Latin alphabet.  Similar to *Q*, the ITU forbids their use because readers could visually confuse them with *O*---used for stations Peru, Lebanon, Austria, Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium, and Denmark, depending on the second letter---or *I* (Italian stations).

That said, sometimes amateurs and political rebels use these unused prefixes for the same reasons that I propose using them, to avoid overlap and misidentification.  If you worry, then, that somebody might associate your fictional television station with disputed Western Sahara (*S0-*) or the Knights of Malta (*1A0*), then you still might want to double-check to see if anybody else has informally claimed the same prefix for their cause.

As with every other system, the ITU reserves certain ranges of prefixes for future expansion, where you can guarantee that it won't conflict with anybody *today*, but that could change at any moment.  Therefore, while *YZ-* might look like a compelling prefix, it might not work out so well in the future.

### Secret Origins...

I should note that my weird quest for creating a "shadow regime" for naming things actually started with television and radio.  An old project started collecting television and radio stations originating in public domain works.  Many of those didn't bother with a prefix at all.  As I assume that anybody in the United States would, I considered prefixing those three-letter call signs with either *K-* or *W-*, because I know those.  For reasons that I've already pointed out, though, this doesn't really work, because a new station could get that call sign at any time.  As a classic example of such new assignments, you've probably seen KBEX in old television shows and films, especially those set around Los Angeles, that sign chosen because no other television or radio station used those letters for many years.  Starting in 2005, though, Texas has had *three* radio stations by that name.

Then I noticed that Quality Comics "created" a prefix in Jack Cole's stories about the character Midnight (Dave Clark), who worked as an announcer for radio station UXAM or sometimes UMAX, because people make mistakes.  I liked that, and considered using *U-* as my "signature" fictional television/radio call sign prefix.  As with *Q-*, *U-* has the virtue of sounding a lot like *W-*, and even shares a common origin.  But then I looked it up, only to discover that the ITU assigns *UX-* to stations in Ukraine and *UM-* to Uzbekistan, both fine places as far as I know, but definitely not reflective of that project's setting.

By contrast, once I spotted it, *Q-* feels perfect, both for the reasons mentioned above, and because I'll almost certainly never use those brevity codes in a fictional work.  Although I admit that QRL and QRM seem disproportionately useful in modern messaging, and I often feel strongly tempted to start using the latter to ask if people can speak freely...

## Web

Probably more critically for most modern media, web addresses look more difficult, especially TLDs.  Originally---and I've listed these elsewhere, I think---only `.example`, `.invalid`, `.test`, and various translations of `test` into various languages would *never* exist.  Those reservations/blocks exist for exactly the reasons that we want to deal with in this post, though the standards people chose the terms for documentation.  You can tell people that they can point your application to a website such as `https://your-server.example`, or `https://their-server.invalid` for something that shouldn't work, and never need to worry that a literal-minded audience will beat on some random server that somebody pays to maintain.

I believe that `.onion` *should* also work, because valid Tor addresses should have either sixteen (for old) or fifty-six (newer) characters and making them readable takes a lot of work, whereas a hypothetical `example.onion` definitely doesn't exist.

### International Options

In addition, ICANN removed `.nato` from service in 1996.  It looks like they also decommissioned country codes `.an`, `.bu`, `.cs`, `.ct`, `.dd`, `.dy`, `.fq`, `.hv`, `.jt`, `.mi`, `.nh`, `.nq`, `.nt`, `.pc`, `.pu`, `.pz`, `.rh`, `.sf`, `.tp`, `.vd`, `.wk`, `.yd`, `.yu`, and `.zr` over the years, as countries have dissolved and gotten absorbed into different entities; and it seems worth pointing out that a few of these lost country codes could see use as so-called "hipster domains" where the TLD helps spell out the word.  And on top of those, `.aa`, `.qm`--`.qz`, `.xa`--`.xz`, and `.zz`, ICANN specifies as user-assigned, so they won't use them.

### Other DNS Roots

In addition to those, which already make for a decent start, you can also find alternate NICs with cheap or free TLDs, such as Namecoin's [dot-BIT](https://www.namecoin.org/dot-bit/) (if you can tolerate cryptocurrencies) (`.bit`) or [OpenNIC](https://opennic.org/)  (`.bbs`, `.chan`, `.cyb`, `.dyn`, `.geek`, `.gopher`, `.indy`, `.libre`, `.neo`, `.null`, `.o`, `.oss`, `.oz`, `.parody`, and `.pirate`), which have the alternative merit of solving the problem by squatting on domains on alternate DNS regimes[^6].  While not perfect, because IANA could always pull the rug out from under them by creating the TLD for their own system, for the "cost" of using an alternate DNS system---this actually happened with the `.xxx` TLD, where ICANN introduced a competing version in 2011 after years of one of these small groups providing one---it looks like people can usually register those domains free of charge, though the site sometimes needs to meet other criteria.

[^6]:  Also, if you don't mind focusing your audience on the sorts of people who can comfortably use an alternative NIC, you can---and presumably they'd prefer that you do---actually use them for real websites, too, as alternative names to your more conventional domains.

I discarded the idea as too much work for any project that I'd want to run, but you could even create entire new TLDs unlikely for anybody else to use and set up a DNS root to serve them, directing your audience to websites with those names...though as I talked about at the top, that should become a long-term commitment.

### It Gets Better

In 2018, ICANN decided to [no longer process applications for `.corp`, `.home`, and `.mail` TLDs](https://www.icann.org/en/board-activities-and-meetings/materials/approved-board-resolutions-regular-meeting-of-the-icann-board-04-02-2018-en#2.c), because of their widespread use in private networks.  That, I think, handles most of the problem that we discuss here, because they both look credible and definitely won't land on some unrelated server.

Eagle-eyed readers might note that I mentioned this in my [*Please Come Back...*]({% post_url 2024-06-23-customer-retention %}) story about a year ago.

In total, then, we end up with three legitimate-looking options, three that work but look absurd, sixty-six non-countries, one international organization, and an assortment of dicey-unless-claiming-the-alternate-domain-cheaply options.  But for the most part, I can quickly imagine `.corp` as the domain of choice for fictional companies, `.home` for other organizations/figures, and `.mail` for individual recipients.  Or using myself as an example, `colagioia.corp` might work for my company's (fictional) domain name, `john.colagioia.home` would map to my personal site, `freeculture.home` some imaginary non-profit organization, and `jcolag@xybercorp.mail`---Xybercorp coming from [**The Spiraling Web**]({% post_url 2021-03-06-spiraling2 %})---would serve as the "private" e-mail address that I share with friends, even though I don't like big-corporate projects, since they all use those same systems.  You might also find companies trying to look trendy with domain names like `unweil.dy` or `varmi.nt`, presumably administered by Dahomey (now Benin/BJ) and the former [Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian%E2%80%93Iraqi_neutral_zone).

## Currency

For the most part, personally, I've settled on the [spesmilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spesmilo) (₷), the First World War-era Esperantists' international currency, divisible into a thousand spesoj.  However, other obsolete currencies have Unicode characters, too, like the Dutch rigsdaler (₻), the French livre tournois (₶), a bunch of ancient Roman options---as (𐆚), denarius (𐆖), dupondius (𐆙), quinarius (𐆗), sestertius (𐆘)---and a lot only obsoleted during the wave of revolutions and regime changes around the 1990s or the introduction of the Euro, so I feel less comfortable with those.

We also have the "scarab," ASCII's placeholder currency symbol (¤), which I actually often used in my pre-Internet notes after discovering its use in some reference book.

Wikipedia has a full list of [currency symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_symbol) in Unicode, including a couple of cryptocurrencies.

It sort of demands an *eventual* conflict, but it also feels entirely reasonable to grab a letter or letter-like form from Unicode---ideally unused in modern alphabets---and give it the currency an appropriate name.  For example, 𝕐 could inspire the yara or something.  Oh, or 𝔾, Ᵹ, 𝔊, 🅖, Ꝿ, Ⰳ, 𐤂‎, or a bunch of other options for fictional country Graustark's *gavvo*.

## Necessary or Not

Many writers get away with not doing any of this work.  Not only do you see it all the time across all media, but its prevalence largely incited this post.
