## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *startrek* tag page](/blog/tag/startrek/).

## Disaster

While I admit to enjoying most of this episode---some of the arcs seem wedged in to make sure that the entire cast got some lines, but *most* of it doesn't function like that---it won't have much for us.  If I find myself poking at it or analyzing something unrelated, I apologize in advance, but we probably won't have much else to talk about, given the focus on the plot and character moments.

 > Captain's log, stardate 45156.1. Our mission to Mudor Five has been completed and since our next assignment will not begin for several days, we are enjoying a welcome respite from our duties.

I have no idea where the star name came from.  I'll skip a lot of the arbitrary terms in this episode, in fact.

Keiko, by the way, appears to have gestated extremely quickly.  In real-time, this episode aired in late October 1991.  We met Keiko in early January 1991, in [*Data's Day*]({% post_url 2024-01-18-data-s-day %}), with appearances later that month in [*The Wounded*]({% post_url 2024-01-25-wounded %}) and then June 1991's [*In Theory*]({% post_url 2024-04-25-in-theory %}), with no hint of a pregnancy.  I suppose that some fetuses do grow in a way that an outside observer would only notice in the last couple of months, *but* I also find it difficult to believe that O'Brien got his wife pregnant and didn't crow endlessly about the quality of his family's sperm...

 > **O'BRIEN**: If it's a boy, Michael, after my father.
 >
 > **KEIKO**: Wait a minute. We decided on Hiro, after my father.

Notice that, whenever we see them together, they seem to have a new reason to fight about whose culture their relationship will respect, and they never seem to indicate that Keiko has much of a chance.

 > **LAFORGE**: All right. {% emoji musical notes %} I am the very model of a modern major general, I've information vegetable, animal and mineral. I can't do this. {% emoji musical notes %}

You probably don't need me to tell you that LaForge sings *Major General's Song* from Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera [**The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance).  And I say that you don't need me for that, because it gets referenced or parodied extremely frequently.

 > **PICARD**: I want you to know we're very proud of the science fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a career in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your science projects?

You can't do better in life than...whatever Picard does, I guess.

 > **PATTERSON**: I planted radishes in this special dirt, and they came up all weird!

Oh, sure, when *he* flippantly summarizes this nonsense, it gets a laugh...

 > **PICARD**: We're falling!

What?  Hold on, here.  Why does the turbolift shaft have gravity?

 > **TROI**: Medical team to the Bridge.

Don't actually *do* anything, Counselor.  Keep calling random places to see the failures...

 > **PICARD**: We most certainly are not. Now listen to me. No one here is going to die. The bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon as possible. So I want you all to stop crying. Everything is going to be all right.

I mean...eventually, they'll *all* die, no?  Does Picard...not know about that?

And also, what kind of jerk talks to kids like that?  I know that he made a point about having trouble dealing with children *way* back in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), but this goes well beyond not understanding how to deal with them and onto actively trying to hurt them.

 > **RO**: I'm alive. What the hell happened?

I like that, narratively, Ro needed to force her way into the script.

 > **O'BRIEN**: Lieutenant Monroe was in command, but she's dead. I believe Counselor Troi is the senior officer on the deck.
 >
 > **RO**: Counselor Troi?
 >
 > **O'BRIEN**: She carries the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

It seems unlikely, doesn't it?  I mean, with the way that she goes out of her way to avoid dressing like the crew or---you know it as well as I do---participating in literally anything productive, you would think that she wouldn't have any formal part in the hierarchy.  Instead, apparently she slacks off dramatically even though she has official duties.

 > **RIKER**: Okay, you and I will try to get there. Mister Worf, this room is going to fill with wounded in a few minutes, and they're going to need help. I want you to stay in charge here.

I'd like to make a point, here, about the deliberateness of the bigotry that we often see on this show.  Specifically, people have joked about the inadvisability of asking Klingons to care for people.  And yet, Riker sees no problem putting Worf in charge of an emergency infirmary, and he'll do a spectacular job of it.

The show *knows* that its characters have terrible ideas.

 > **PICARD**: Your name is Marissa. Is that right? Well, Marissa, I'm going to need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest and so that makes you my Number One.

I bet that explains a lot of the staffing decisions that we've seen.

 > **PICARD**: Then I shall appoint you my executive officer in charge of radishes. There. Right, then let's get to work.

I...

Where do I even go with this nonsense?

They wrote it as a throwaway joke, but it feels a lot like Picard decided to grant respect to the two blonde kids and make a patronizing comment to the leftover with darker skin, and I guess that we shouldn't notice it.

 > **TROI**: So, it's like a cosmic string?
 >
 > **O'BRIEN**: No. that's a completely different phenomenon.

And despite the amount of worthless technobabble in this episode, we'll hear nothing more about the one technical item that *might* actually make a difference to the plot, as opposed to debating about the conductivity of Data's exoskeleton.

 > **RO**: We're not going to get out of this by playing it safe.

Have I mentioned how much I like this character...?

 > **O'BRIEN**: If it falls to fifteen percent the field will collapse, and we'll have a containment breach.
 >
 > **TROI**: Which means?
 >
 > **RO**: Which means the ship will explode.

I feel like this shows us that Troi makes herself *deliberately* ignorant.  If she can't make the connection, after five years on the ship, that losing antimatter containment leads to blowing up the ship, then has she paid *any* attention at all?  It seems especially problematic, given how much they cut to her looking pensive in meetings, where now we need to ask if she does that to cover trying to remember old songs or something.

 > **RIKER**: Let me get this straight. You want me to take off your head?

Didn't he yank off Data's hand in hopes of proving Data's lack of citizenship in [*The Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %})?  Why would carting around the head suddenly make him queasy?

 > **MARISSA**: The crew has decided to stick together. We all go or we all stay.

Hilariously, Marissa runs a significantly more egalitarian and mature command than the seasoned professional who everybody refers to as a diplomat...

 > **KEIKO**: No, I mean contractions. I'm going into labor.
 >
 > **WORF**: You cannot. This is not a good time, Keiko.

I've asked this before, but why has nobody given Michael Dorn a sitcom?  Or maybe they should've paired Keiko with Worf instead of O'Brien.

 > **O'BRIEN**: No evidence they're dead, either. If you were trapped down there, would you like us to just cut you loose and leave?

I don't mean to completely side with Ro, here, but it occurs to me that *nobody* brings up the point that the drive section should have a predominantly or completely Starfleet staff.  That seems like it changes the calculation, since some of them literally signed up for a job where they might die at any time, whereas the saucer crew presumably has a bunch of civilians who only waived insurance claims.

 > **PICARD**: We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall. Everything will be all right if you just keep climbing. What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing at school?
 >
 > **MARISSA**: *The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog*?

That...sounds super-racist.

No, really.  Let's not worry about actual race, here.  Seriously, swap out "Vulcan" for any real-world ethnicity and tell me that you'd feel completely comfortable learning that local schoolchildren sang with an equivalent name.

 > **PICARD**: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. *Frère Jacques*. That's a song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know that one? Good. It goes like this. {% emoji musical notes %} Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques, dormez vous? Dormez vous? {% emoji musical notes %}

Other than "Picard identifies with the French," I don't quite know what to make of the choice of a song about a French friar oversleeping.  However, I do want to point out that the melody has spread *fast*, possibly originating as a similar southern-European tune, has become integrated into Chinese folk musical tradition, and you can even hear hints of it in the third movement of [Mahler's first symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._1_%28Mahler%29) (The Hunter's Funeral) in a minor key.

 > **TROI**: We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time, and not before. Is that clear, Ensign?

Notice again that, exactly like [*Redemption, part 2*]({% post_url 2024-05-16-redemption-part-2 %}), angrily yelling at a subordinate makes you a legitimate leader on this ship.

 > **DATA**: Yes, sir. You must now change the input matrix in my secondary optical port and then connect the ODN conduit. That is not the correct port, sir.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Sorry.

And everybody goes to Riker for advice on sex...

Oh, my apologies, did I type that out loud?

 > **TROI**: I don't think I'm cut out to be Captain. First officer, maybe. I understand there aren't many qualifications.

Oh, sure, when *she* points that out...

Also, in all the show's mindless nostalgia, how did we not get at least *one* episode of **Picard** where the retired admiral needs to work with his now-adult crew of child laborers to solve a critical problem...?

## Conclusions

We have finally gotten away from Shakespeare and the 1930s as sources of popular culture to settle on the most mainstream of Gilbert and Sullivan, *Frère Jacques*, and at least the title of a modern folk tune.

### The Bad

We continue to see clashes for dominance between Earth cultures, with marriages coming into conflict over which traditions to respect.

At least Picard seems to think that children should see Starfleet as the best possible career choice to aspire to.

Despite Troi's complete indifference to everything going on around her, she has a fairly high rank among the crew.  And even in an emergency, she almost goes out of her way to not help people and to show her studied ignorance on every topic.

We see strong indications that the racist stereotypes against certain groups have no basis in reality, which exposes the racism as present in their universe, as well, even as we hear about children's songs that seem to embrace similar stereotypes.  Similarly, the children's view of command structures exposes the ship's approach as pointlessly authoritarian, even as we see that the crew sees anger and aggression as legitimizing authority.

## Next

Come back in a week, when Wesley and Lefler both return to discover the evils of video games---and I realize how enticing I made that sound---in *The Game*.
