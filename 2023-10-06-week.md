As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I don't know, it seems to have turned into all cowlicks.")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I wouldn't call any of this surprising, but like the article says, you can't do the work of fighting their propaganda without understanding what it says and how it works.

I suppose that this won't change their approach, but I do have to appreciate that it has become far more difficult for them to find people to "play along" with their nonsense.

 > ### Every Office Has a Garak...

 > When I *almost* responded to a colleague, this morning, that of the many conflicting things that another company had told us on a call, that "it's all true, *especially* the lies," my role suddenly came into focus.
 >
 > Mysterious past?  Taking an interest in unconventional younger colleagues?  Lunchtime-adjacent meetings?  Literary discussions, off-book projects, maintaining covert information channels?  Sense of someone sending me into exile?  Wide range of unrelated-seeming skills, most of which have a weird story about a time that I had to work with someone halfway around the world under ill-defined but tense circumstances?  Yes, yep, uh-huh, check, and mm-hmm.
 >
 > I appear to have become...**the Office Garak**.  I guess that I finally need to get that sewing machine working again to complete the transformation.  And word of warning?  If you can't spot the Garak in your office...it's probably *you*.

For the record, I have a "mysterious" past to the extent that more than half the companies that I've worked for no longer exist, with many having gone through multiple rounds of someone buying them, and *that* company going out of business.  However, it does make discussing my past interesting:  *Did* I write COBOL programs to test voicemail phone-trees, or did someone fabricate that as a front so that I could monitor the airport across the street...?

Oh, and for the (presumed majority of) readers unaware of the context, **Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine** included recurring character Elim Garak---played by Andrew J. Robinson---an exiled former spy who, posing as a tailor, takes the young doctor character under his wing, almost always communicating through subtext.  Garak became a popular secondary character, certainly one of *my* favorite characters on a show full of great characters, and the folks on Cohost disproportionately love **DS9**, hence posting there.

Although, I also mostly find myself giddy at my creation of Cohost's [#Am I the Garak?](https://cohost.org/rc/tagged/am%20I%20the%20Garak) hashtag, which I hope sees further use by my fellow probably-not-spies...

I feel the need to point out that, in my lifetime, I've watched the publishing industry transition directly from "we can't survive without advertising, and that requires some compromises" to "advertising doesn't work at all, so we use it as a pretext for data-mining operations."  Maybe we should find better business models, if true...

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0a00-0242-0915-08dbbee74e17_w1023_r1_s.jpg|President Joe Biden speaks to striking United Auto Workers on the picket line outside the Willow Run Redistribution Center, UAW Local 174, Sept. 26, 2023, in Van Buren Township, Mich|false| %}

 > The union claims more than 400,000 members. Many point to the sharp rise in company profits and CEO pay but also to the much smaller rise in worker pay.

It shouldn't, at this point, but it does still surprise me how little play this story got.  Even in what they want you to call far-left press, they jumped directly from *demanding* that Biden support the UAW to complaining about something unrelated...

 > Serpent Mound lies 125 miles to the south of Newark. It is a nearly 1,400-foot-long effigy of a coiled serpent that also tracks the summer and winter solstice.

I have never heard of it, and assume that they mean a different Newark than the two that I know about, but it *sounds* like an interesting site.
