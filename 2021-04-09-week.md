As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1379057483642114050) [The conservative movement is rejecting America](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/1/22356594/conservatives-right-wing-democracy-claremont-ellmers) from Vox

 > Ellmers’s essay is in line with this tradition, identifying freedom as a right that only a certain section of the population deserves.

This is an excellent article, but it misses an important point in linking it to the Trump campaign and administration, despite the mention of George Wallace.  Karl Rove would give interviews to anybody who would listen, talking about [REDMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP).  Since Nixon's [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy), Republicans have embraced the idea that people of color and women need to be controlled, insisting that reversing the effects of discrimination is "the real racism/sexism."  There were plenty of people in the 1930s who wanted to join World War II on the side of the Nazis, and the Nazis modeled their policies on Jim Crow laws.  I previously wrote about [the divide between the Enlightenment and Romanticism]({% post_url 2020-09-06-enlight %}), underscoring that this has always been with us, and we need to treat it as a chronic problem, if we're going to fix it.

What's different is that they know that they're cornered, and like any cornered animal, the movement wants to lash out in hopes of forcing everybody to back away.

 > Republican-controlled state legislatures have proposed 253 bills in 43 states that aim to prevent millions of Americans, and especially Americans of color, from voting in federal and state elections.

And they wonder why Democrat legislators are trying to just ignore them, now, instead of giving them the opportunity to derail help for constituents in favor of more voter suppression.

 > The Idaho budget also prohibits using state funds to “support social justice ideology student activities, clubs, events, and organizations on campus.”

I really don't know what to tell you, if you don't see "opposition to social justice" as the most obvious red flag available...

[<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/1380144395303809026) [White mobs rioted in Washington in 1848 to defend slaveholders’ rights after 76 Black enslaved people staged an unsuccessful mass escape on a boat](https://theconversation.com/white-mobs-rioted-in-washington-in-1848-to-defend-slaveholders-rights-after-76-black-enslaved-people-staged-an-unsuccessful-mass-escape-on-a-boat-156445) from The Conversation

 > Seventy-six Black men, women and children, having quietly left area farms, hid beneath the deck. Drayton and Sayres steered the ship down the Potomac River.

It's important, sometimes, to take a moment to realize that, as many times as right-wing jerks try to scare white America about a "race war," the only times we've come close to such a thing has been white people insisting that it's bad to not hate Black people.  If we can just stop doing that, I think we'll be fine.

 > ...analysis points to the need for additional experiments to separately test the effects of specific light wavelengths and medium composition.

Given how many people instantly tried to get into the business of UV-cleaners for everything that you own---most of which don't have nearly enough LEDs to do anything useful, which you can verify by comparing the price of any device to the wholesale price of LEDs---it's disappointing that it took this long to get this research moving.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here are any additional articles that didn't fit into the week, but too weird or important to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Bert Rose, pioneer of Jamaica’s independence-era dance movement, dies at 81](https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/02/bert-rose-pioneer-of-jamaicas-independence-era-dance-movement-dies-at-81/) from Global Voices

 > Rose was among the seventeen founding members of the NDTC, brought together by Jamaican cultural icon, the late Rex Nettleford and choreographer Eddy Thomas.

Not every article needs to be about earth-shattering consequences.  Sometimes, it's just remembering the impact of an artist that too few people are aware of.
