## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The Perfect Mate

I assure you that this episode bears no absolutely no similarity to [*Elaan of Troyius*]({% post_url 2021-05-13-elaan %}), got it?  We only have two unrelated stories where two cultures use an exoticized woman, played by a famous model breaking into acting, to make peace after long wars, while said woman feels torn between her duty and the captain of the *Enterprise*.  Other than that minor plot point, these episodes have no similarity whatsoever...

 > **BRIAM**: Please, Captain, we are grateful that the Federation has taken as much interest as it has in this matter.

Huh, I think that we've finally found somebody who trusts the Federation.

 > **RIKER**: Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests to quarters. Not too close to mine.

Sigh...do I really need to deal with the random racism of Riker feeling fine with the Ferengi as long as he can keep them out of his neighborhood?

 > **LENOR**: We are in no hurry.

You might recognize Lenor as [Max Grodénchik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Grod%C3%A9nchik), who will go on to play fellow-Ferengi Rom on **Deep Space Nine**.

 > **BRIAM**: Ball park?

If only they had some sort of translation system that had an awareness of idioms...

 > **LENOR**: Ah, do you schedule his appointments?
 >
 > **PICARD**: I'm the Captain of the ship. What is it you want?

I love that Lenor has Picard's number, treating him like a nobody to provoke a reaction.

 > **LAFORGE**: Listen, have you had a chance to see the dolphins yet?

Wait, what?  **I** haven't seen these dolphins, and I've slogged through well over a hundred episodes of this mess.  Show me the damned dolphins, Starfleet...

 > **KAMALA**: I am for you, Alrik of Valt.

You might recognize Kamala as [Famke Janssen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famke_Janssen), mostly a model at the time, but will soon hit it big in acting in [**GoldenEye**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye), and went on to star in...a lot, honestly.

Notice the spots around her temples, by the way.  Apparently, the producers offered to bring Janssen over to **Deep Space Nine** (with the aforementioned Grodénchik), and the spots would get recycled for Jadzia Dax, the show's Trill character, despite the appearance of the Trill established in [*The Host*]({% post_url 2024-04-11-host %}).  I mention this, because when we get to **DS9**, we'll need to deal with the fact that most of Dax's plots will revolve around her dating or having dated somebody weird, and that might make more sense---though not better *taste*---in retrospect if they originally envisioned the character as a version of Kamala who finds a way to leave Alrik.

That said, in 2024 many more of us in the West know this than we did in 1992, but naming the character [Kamala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_%28name%29) codes her as Hindu or connected with the culture, despite the performer's Dutch heritage.  I make that point, because it suggests a deliberate attempt to reference the creepy Orientalism of *Elaan of Troyius*, which...maybe don't maintain those particular traditions, TV writers?

 > **PICARD**: There is a provision in the Federation Constitution that protects an individual's fundamental rights. Now once you were brought aboard this ship---

Seriously?  And they didn't bother to mention that in [*Measure of a Man*]({% post_url 2023-01-19-measure-man %}) or [*The Offspring*]({% post_url 2023-08-17-offspring %}), when it seemed relevant?

Also, I can't help noticing that trespassing gets you imprisoned---confined to quarters, as Picard has done with the Ferengi---but depriving a person of "an individual's fundamental rights" warrants...an offhanded mention that they shouldn't do it, I guess, because Briam doesn't seem to face any sort of reprimand.

It smells like racism to me, but I admit that it might also fall under the "white guy wearing a blazer" rubric.

 > **KAMALA**: Oh, I think you are more empathic than you admit. At least when it comes to women.
 >
 > **RIKER**: I think you have me at a disadvantage.

As always, Riker has a fit of terror when a woman shows interest in him...

 > **RIKER**: Listen. This has been educational, but I make it a policy never to open another man's gift.

Ew.  Oh, dear.  In other words, Riker would (theoretically) let Kamala seduce him, but y'know, he has respect...for a man who he knows nothing about.  While I don't want to suggest that Riker *should* take advantage of Kamala, I also find it about as sexist as I can imagine for him to place a higher value on some hypothetical man's ownership than what the woman in front of him wants.  Turn her down, sure, but never make it about not wanting to harm some unknown third party.

And it only now occurs to me that we've never seen any of these people work with a married woman.  They haven't come any closer, to my recollection, than the widow Crusher and...that time in [*Haven*]({% post_url 2022-07-28-haven %}) when they all wigged out over the possibility of Troi getting married.  Oh, and [*We'll Always Have Paris*]({% post_url 2022-10-27-paris %}), technically, where the episode forces them to work with Picard's now-married ex, so that the husband can mostly disavow their relationship to make way for she and Picard to have a date.

In other words, do they have an actual *policy* preventing them from interacting with married women, and if so, does Starfleet support or even enforce it?

 > **RIKER**: Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four.

Oh, lovely, make it *more* disgusting.  And by "disgusting," I mean both using work hours to masturbate and using holodeck characters---who we've seen come pretty close to consciousness of their own---as disposable masturbatory aids who can't consent.

And that doesn't even touch the fact that he seems to think that a woman showing an interest in him entitles him to immediate sex, even when he rejects her.  Does Starfleet Academy not have a class on keeping it in your pants?  It seems like they should have at least one...

 > **CRUSHER**: How can you simply deliver her like a courier into a life of virtual prostitution.

While Crusher will go on to make some actual good points shortly that we won't really care about, this seems to suggest that sex workers still don't get any respect.  While it says nothing about the legality of sex work, this attitude of it as a low-class occupation that you "subject" lesser people to reflects how they've treated other female-coded service-sector jobs in episodes like *The Offspring*, not to mention Picard bristling at the idea of serving as Briam's assistant, earlier in the episode.

 > **PICARD**: Don't do this, this, this you do with men.

And Picard has the same abject terror as Riker, where he can't even form sentences.

 > **KAMALA**: I'm afraid my premature emergence from stasis has left me a little vulnerable to the desires I sense from men. Nevertheless, this is who I am, Captain. You might as well ask a Vulcan to forgo logic, or a Klingon to be nonviolent. I cannot change, and I don't want to until the time has come for me to bond with my permanent mate. Why does it bother you?

This franchise, at its best, shows that people from different cultures can actually grow beyond the constraints of their cultures.  It seems a bit obnoxious that Picard doesn't point out the times when Worf reined in his desire for vengeance, such as [*Skin of Evil*]({% post_url 2022-10-20-skin-evil %}).

 > **BRIAM**: She is still in the Finiis'ral, the height of her sexual allure, Captain. Every man on the ship will be fighting over her.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Not every man.

Oh, will we finally acknowledge the existence of---

 > **KAMALA**: A chaperone?

Nope.  No, we will not.  Though I suppose that this use of Data does gesture at a vague acknowledgement of asexual people, maybe, at least if nobody made them out of meat...

 > **DATA**: Your empathic powers do not perceive anything because as an android, I have no emotions.

How many hours could they trim out of this series, if Data would accept that he has emotions or not feel the need to tell anybody too slow to run away?  It also occurs to me that, in [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}), Data lists entire groups---such as the Ferengi---whose emotions empathic abilities can't detect, making his assertion seem even more premature than usual.

However, it feels like they should've gone with the more interesting question of whether Kamala's pheromones affect Data, because he certainly doesn't have hormone levels connected to a sense of smell.  But as [*The Naked Now*]({% post_url 2022-06-02-naked %}) made sure that we all understood, Data has at least some sex drive.

 > **KAMALA**: I understand. I will volunteer to stay in my quarters under one condition. That you will visit me. There it is again.

Did Picard react by...covering his crotch out of the camera frame?  They'll show his hands on his thighs, after cutting to a different camera, but...

 > **KAMALA**: My empathic powers can only sense a man of deep passion, and conviction. So controlled. So disciplined. I am simply curious to know what lies beneath.

As the Wikipedia folks say, [citation needed].  We've yet to see much passion, conviction, control, or discipline from him.  The authoritative voice helps cover it, though.

 > **KAMALA**: Even the walls of Jericho fell, Captain.

One of the oldest cities in the world, [Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho) did have a defense wall, which (allegedly) fell in the [Battle of Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho) after the Israelites spent a week making as much noise as possible.

Ironically, given that this scene started with a deep conversation about their mutual interest in archaeology, nobody has found any evidence of a comparable event during the right era, suggesting that the Battle of Jericho might have more legend in it than truth.

 > **BRIAM**: Let go of me.

What subcontractor makes these tables?  Given how the ship thrashes around during crises, I have to imagine that Starfleet has a non-negligible number of annual deaths from these things.  Somebody should alert space-OSHA.  I thought that the glasses in [*Cause and Effect*]({% post_url 2024-09-12-cause-effect %}) seemed problematic, but these seem designed to impale somebody who lands on them wrong.

 > **PICARD**: I find you unavailable.

Once again, we have the repulsive idea that you can take advantage of women, but only if another man doesn't have a claim on her.

 > **ALRIK**: Captain Picard.

You probably don't recognize [Mickey Cottrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Cottrell), but considering that he passed away at the start of this year, I figure that I should at least call out his decent work, here, briefly.

 > **KAMALA**: Earl Grey Tea. Hot.

You might notice that Kamala doesn't need to spit out her order in a precisely formed, staccato sequence.  Do the computers have trouble recognizing Picard's accent...?  It would certainly track with the other user interface silliness that we've seen on this show, if Picard tried ordering "hot Earl Grey tea" a few times and ended up with otter gratiné or some nonsense like that.

 > **CRUSHER**: Penny?
 >
 > **PICARD**: What?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: For your thoughts. Penny for your thoughts.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Do you have one?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: I'm sure the replicator will have one on file.

That seems like a weird idiom to persist for centuries when they at least don't have cash and don't even know if the computer has enough data to create new pennies.

 > **PICARD**: Beverly, may I take off the uniform for a moment?
 >
 > **CRUSHER**: Captain...

Two points, here.

First, even figuratively, you *do not say that* to a colleague, ever.

Second, having breakfast with the boss, who needs to *act* as the boss during breakfast, seems like the absolute worst case for Crusher.

 > **PICARD**: It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and who she is changes the moment the next man comes into the room.  And I find myself hoping that the next man won't come in. But, of course, he does, and in a few hours, the ceremony will begin, and she will mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than he cares about her. And I can't help thinking how she will be with him. How she will change to accommodate him.

Notice that he stopped worrying about her welfare.  Now he worries about her *judgment*, that she has chosen the wrong mate, because he disagrees, as if he should have more of a say than she does.

 > **KAMALA**: I am for you, Alrik of Valt.

You'll notice "humanity has evolved" Picard seethes with jealousy over a quick kiss.  In a deleted scene, this goes along with a painfully extensive sequence where Picard fantasizes about breaking up the wedding to everybody's praise.  In other words, "ugh."

Unrelated, what the Hell happened, here?  They made such a big deal about brokering a peace, the complexity of the process, and the extensive preparations required, suggesting a massive undertaking.  But instead, we get a tiny wedding with no officiant or witnesses other than Picard, and apparently that seals the deal.  Have none of these people heard of e-mail...?

## Conclusions

The *Enterprise* apparently has secret dolphins on board.

### The Good

For the first time in the series, we've found cultures that respect and trust the Federation.

While they don't seem to apply it at all evenly, the Federation apparently protects certain fundamental rights to all individuals under their governance.

### The Bad

We see continued racism in the treatment of the Ferengi, not to mention accepting stereotypes including that you can't have Vulcans who ignore logic or Klingons who put aside violence.  And they still appear to have everyone learn English to communicate, or the translators don't handle idioms...though they also seem to retain idioms that they don't see as relevant.

Status remains important, with outsiders knowing that they can provoke people by implying that they have low-level jobs.  And if the Federation doesn't ban sex work outright, they definitely classify it in that same "menial" category that you subject the lower classes to.  And Picard makes a point that, in "friendly" off-duty association with members of his crew, he still has authority in that situation.

The episode mostly revolves around its sexual politics, however.  Picard and Riker both make it clear that they don't want to spend time with another man's prospective mate.  They can't handle a woman showing any autonomy.  Many people seem to think that encountering an attractive woman obliges her to have sex, or at least that the man deserves it.  They use horribly inappropriate metaphors.  Men seem to think that a woman's prior interest in them should give them some oversight on who she gets involved with later.  And they displace completely irrational jealousy.

We continue to need to suffer through the "Data has no emotions" dance.

Everybody's coffee tables shatter into dangerous shivs under almost any strain.

We see some evidence that people speaking in different accents need to approach instructing the computer differently, with some allowed a more relaxed diction and flow.

## Next

Come back next week, when a lonely kid gets help to destroy the *Enterprise*, in *Imaginary Friend*.
