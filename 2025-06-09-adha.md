Today, most of the Muslim, Druze, and Alawite world wraps up celebrating [Eid al-Adha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha), either today or tomorrow, depending on where you live.  The rest of the Muslim world starts on different days.  Formally, it honors Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to obey his god's orders.  Less formally, like many modern holidays, you probably see more social gatherings, big meals, gifts, and the like.

Anyway, let's check out the week's projects.

## Social Media

I don't know if this actually qualifies as social media, but I signed up for an [ORCID account](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0009-0003-1887-4873).  I haven't the foggiest idea if it does anything useful for me, but if I start writing and publishing something more formal than blog posts, it seems like I could do worse than using an identifier that seems to have open aspirations if not necessarily a current implementation.

## Stenotype Corner

This, the sixth week of the project, probably looks more like the sort of progress that we'd generally like to see.  Picking up where we left off last time, I moved to the third lesson---*One-Syllable Words with More Consonants*---and quickly moved to randomizing the words when my speed and accuracy didn't change, presumably because (almost) all the words come from prior lessons, but with the less-complex words removed.  After validating that idea, I moved to the lesson after that, *One-syllable Words with F as V or S*, which I similarly got through quickly with a random ordering.  That only took until Tuesday.

The lesson after that, though, *One-syllable words with unstressed vowels*, that actually had the expected hits to speed (roughly twenty-two words per minute) and accuracy (less than eighty percent), because it introduces more complicated words along the line of *trusted* (`TRUFTD`).  That not only requires remembering that early-coda[^1] /s/ sound uses the {% key F %} key, but also getting the right pinky to neatly straddle the {% key T %} and {% key D %} or {% key S %} and {% key Z %} keys.

[^1]:  Have I needed to talk about syllable structure before?  Each syllable, in almost any language, has three parts.  The *onset* of consonants, the *nucleus* vowel sound, and the *coda* of more consonants.  For various reasons, either the onset or coda might get dropped.  This has effects in natural-language processing, because it means that it takes a ton of effort to do almost anything useful *except* count syllables, because you only need to identify each nucleus.  But it also guides everything in machine stenography.  The seven keys on the left make the onsets, the four vowel keys the nuclei, and the eleven keys on the right the codas...except in cases along the lines of those described in the main post, where we "cheat" and throw in the second syllable because we don't stress the nucleus, such as an *-ed* or *-es* suffix.  This syllable structure gets at so-called "steno order," where we prioritize the consonants and coda in an up/down zigzag pattern, reading from left to right, because an /s/ sound in the onset will almost always come before a /k/ or /p/, but it'll generally come at the *end* of the coda.  When it comes earlier in the coda, the keyboard uses the {% key F %} key, instead, which will come up momentarily in the main post.

Wait, I can do better than trying to explain the keys.

{% steno TRUFTD %}

There.  To recap, on diagrams like the above, imagine your (scale-appropriate) left pointer finger on the boundary between {% key H %} and {% key R %} and your right between {% key F %} and {% key R %} opposite the key marked with an asterisk that acts more like a general utility key, and the rest of your fingers splay outward from there.  You can now see what I meant before, by comparing it to the image, instead of trying to visualize it based on random letters.  Again, that spells (sounds) out "trusted," with the right-pinky covering those two right-most keys.

Anyway, again, it took a couple of days---and *patience* instead of haste---to get back to and consistently exceed my previous speeds and accuracy, topping out at thirty-five words per minute and (once) an actual hundred-percent accuracy, though not quite at the same time.  For reference, on a QWERTY keyboard, I type around sixty words per minute with some errors, so six weeks has gotten me to roughly half my older typing speed, with decades-older brain and fingers.

By the weekend, I had started the next (sixth, I believe) lesson, *One-syllable words with inversion*, where---as the name suggests---the sounds don't appear in "steno order."  Take a quick example, since I went to the trouble of rigging that up...

{% steno WOFL %}

If you read that first footnote, you already understand the rough structure of the keyboard and ordering of the keys.  Here, while the keyboard assumes that a syllable with both an /f/ and /l/ sound on the same side of the vowel will happen in that order---think of flow, rifle, and so forth, the latter of which you can insert some ignorable vowel sound into, but probably don't---like everything else in English, we have a small fraction of exceptions.  Rather than try to accommodate those words directly, pretend to break the word up into two syllables (as in "wool-eff"), or concoct some weird abbreviation, the Plover "theory" (and probably most others) says to live with the exception and flip the sounds.

Anyway, I had to slow down again to make this work, but haven't lost accuracy, and speed started climbing back as usual.  This drill only has seven words in it---scarf, solve, twelfth, twelve, wolf, wolves, and worst---so I'll probably move on today.

### Study in General

In addition to the progress above, I have also almost finished reading [**Art of Chording**](https://www.artofchording.com/), getting in some extra practice along the way.

Actually, I should probably describe how that particular practice works, in case somebody needs to know about the tool.  In previous years, I tried to type the lessons in a text editor, which required tabbing back and forth to read and type, alternating between the programs, maybe even remembering the words from time to time...

This time through, on my laptop, I already run software called [uLauncher](https://ulauncher.io/), which gives me a pop-up command line to play with[^2].  It also makes a nice scratch-space to use a stenography keyboard without messing with the general workflow---provided that I don't accidentally throw in a carriage return, which kicks off a Google search, and which doesn't have a configuration option to at least direct it elsewhere---a big help for practice like that.

[^2]:  uLauncher also evaluates mathematical expressions, and has a wide variety of plugins.  As a result, I use it for things like unit conversions, grabbing the rare emoji, grabbing the even rarer non-emoji Unicode symbol for when I need to direct somebody to §5.9.4(c)(ii) of some complex formal document, copy a password from my password manager, and so forth.

Maybe I'll look at one of the other books during the week.

### Pardon the Digression

Also, I don't know if I mentioned this in the past six weeks, but I actually find myself enjoying the stenography exercise for its own sake.  The blog format of progress and problems---designed mainly for people interested in learning this for themselves, showing that even a fossil like myself can do it and where successors might want to deviate from my path---doesn't really show any enthusiasm except through the number of words that I write on the topic, but seeing progress in both speed and utility (judging the latter by the number of words available) as the task becomes more difficult, not to mention the fact that I'll almost certainly *use* the skill regularly, after a certain point[^3], makes this surprisingly entertaining.

[^3]:  I should note that, when I start using stenography more regularly, I'll probably need to supplement my SOFT/HRUF keyboard with something more portable.  In my usual spots for working, I either have or (with a stool and books or boxes) can make space for the extra keyboard.  But moving outside (the bane of my practicing in previous years) and smaller or other less formalized spots, I don't really see a comfortable position for the thing.  A small split keyboard, though, I could *probably* affix to the laptop near the hinge, one piece on each side, though, and that would probably suffice.  Mind you, I could also probably get a longer cord for between the two halves of my existing keyboard, and create sort of a supplemental lap-desk, too, something to thread under the laptop while keeping the keyboard-halves in position.  Maybe...

That probably accounts for the jump in speed as much as anything.  Because I enjoy it, I look for (and find) more excuses to get in some quick practice, especially as I polish off [**Art of Chording**](https://www.artofchording.com/).

## Library Updates

Take a deep breath, because I needed to bump library versions for [**AttaCard Generator**](https://github.com/jcolag/AttaCard-Generator), [**Bicker**](https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker), the (never really started) [**Bisheng Reader**](https://github.com/jcolag/bisheng), my [**Morning Dashboard**](https://github.com/jcolag/dash), [**Fýlakas Onomáton**](https://github.com/jcolag/fylakas-onomaton), [**Ham Newsletter**](https://github.com/jcolag/ham-newsletter), [**Little Scuttlers**](https://github.com/jcolag/LittleScuttlers), [**Renewals Database**](https://github.com/jcolag/RenewDB), [**Uxuyu**](https://github.com/jcolag/Uxuyu), and [**Zoea**](https://github.com/jcolag/zoea).

## Next

I found repositories where GitHub's "Dependabot" apparently stopped notifying me to fix things---hence the assortment of projects requiring library updates that I haven't talked about in years---so I'll try to keep slogging through those.  It buys me time to figure out how to resolve the library conflict that I mentioned [last week]({% post_url 2025-06-02-sex-workers %}#library-updates) for Jekyll's infrastructure.  Keen-eyed readers might also notice that, when I've finished that, I have things to check in, such as how I got those fancy stenography keyboards to drop into posts[^4]...

[^4]:  I wouldn't expect anybody to check the HTML or the Markdown version, but I created a `steno` plugin that creates an inline SVG image with the specified keys shaded darker to indicate that somebody "pressed" them.  And the image follows the browser light/dark preferences, too.
