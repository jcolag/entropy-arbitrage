Happy Valentine's Day, I suppose, to all who celebrate...

* Ignore for ToC

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "I hate Venn diagram memes, especially when they don't make any sense")

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

Seriously, you *absolutely* want to click through on this one.  They look amazing and underscore the hatred behind blackface caricatures by showing that, yes, everybody could absolutely see what Black people looked like.

I love this story, and it surprises me that nobody has adapted aspects of this for fiction...

It was the intended and foreseeable culmination of a carefully coordinated campaign to interfere with the legal process required to confirm the tally of votes cast in the Electoral College.

It never ceases to amaze me how often we need to re-learn that you can (only?) solve poverty by *giving poor people money*, not by moralizing at them or demanding that they jump through hoops.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

{% embed https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8992-1200x900.jpg|Lunar New Year decorations|false| %}

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [UNESCO is unwittingly contributing to the controversy surrounding the term ‚ÄòLunar New Year‚Äô](https://globalvoices.org/2025/02/04/unesco-is-unwittingly-contributing-to-the-controversy-surrounding-the-term-lunar-new-year/) from Global Voices

 > Some Chinese online patriots also turned to Taiwanese and Hongkongers ‚Äî where the term Lunar New Year is more common ‚Äî and said their translation preference showed separatist undertones. Hence, ¬†some embarked on a boycott against Chinese companies that used ‚ÄúLunar New Year‚Äù in their greeting posters. A Guangdong-based animation blogger, for example, [called out](https://weibo.com/1223812162/Pb5HYtSSe) five Chinese companies on Weibo:

This actually surprises me, considering that you'd imagine the United Nations and UNESCO would want to create solidarity instead of nationalism.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Economic inequality is bad for democracy](https://www.futurity.org/economic-inequality-democratic-erosion-3267292/) from Futurity

 > The researchers also traced the link between income inequality and democratic backsliding through increased partisan polarization, a widely identified cause of democratic backsliding. The more polarized the public is, the more willing a part of the public will be to turn a blind eye to presidents and prime ministers attacking the press, the courts, and other institutions.

We've seen study after study telling us this, not to mention first-hand evidence of somebody so wealthy that he seems to have bought himself the United States government.  Speaking of Apartheid Clyde...

 > The messages indicate that, under Elon Musk‚Äôs leadership, DOGE is actively taking steps to make sure its communications and records are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, a records transparency law commonly used by journalists and lawyers to hold government accountable. Instead, DOGE is asserting that rather than reporting up through the Office of Management and Budget as the United States Digital Service did for years, it is reporting through the Executive Office of the President and to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Under OMB, it was generally subject to FOIA. Under the White House Chief of Staff, records it creates are generally not subject to FOIA.

They want to do perfectly ordinary things...that they also need to keep secret, for some *definitely* legal reason.
