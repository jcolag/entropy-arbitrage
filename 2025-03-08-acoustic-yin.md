To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

There you go...

## What Works Well?

First, I appreciate that the songs center the lyrics, making this almost a series of spoken word pieces.  With a couple of exceptions, they all have something to literally say, including my favorite fragment of a line, here.

 > I got the used car salesman running the government blues.

I have no idea why that might have resonated with me so much.

Speaking of centering the lyrics, I should also mention that they often struck me as highly literate.  Some wear their inspirations on their sleeve, such as *O Henry Ending*, but others slip through in the middle of a stream-of-consciousness description.  Similarly, *さ​く​ら​さ​く​ら* rotates the lyrics through a variety of languages, but makes them feel part of a cohesive whole.

As a complement to that, we also hear quite a bit of experimental work in the instrumentation, including---unless I miss my guess---plucking at cello strings below the bridge.

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

Despite the importance of the lyrics, quite a few of the songs don't have lyrics attached to them, or they have the first couple of lines followed by some indication that the lyrics *should* continue, such as an ellipsis.  Especially concerning, this often goes with the tracks that have the worst production quality, making it difficult to follow the song.

Speaking of which, the tracks come from a variety of sources and venues, meaning that the aforementioned production quality definitely varies.  Some sound perfectly clear, while a couple bury themselves in surprisingly loud instrumentation, crowd conversation, and muddy vocals.

## Opportunities

You can buy the album digitally and on CD, some occasional merchandise in addition to albums, plus their entire (digital) collection.  I don't see any attempt to cultivate a community, however.

## What's Adaptable?

Nothing specific comes to mind, with most of the songs seeming to go more for describing a feeling of something than detailing specific things or events.

## Coming Attractions

Next time, we'll continue listening to fiff dimension, with **electric (yang)**.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the album?
