## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story, if you happen to have that [irrational fear](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists).

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## The First Duty

Prepare yourself.  We have a lot of Wesley ahead of us.

Also, for those who keep track of these things, while this story technically starts *much* further back---at least to [*The Child*]({% post_url 2022-11-24-child %}) when Wesley tells Guinan that he feels the need to always do what (higher-status) people expect of him---**Lower Decks** looks at this episode as the first domino falling over that leads to that series.  I've gone on record as finding the show disappointing, but for those who enjoy it, maybe that'll help you see the episode before us in a different light.

 > **PICARD**: We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Sounds like my superintendent. When I was at the Academy, we had a Vulcan Superintendent who had memorized the personnel files of every single cadet. He knew everything about them. It was like having your parents around all the time.
 >
 > **PICARD**: My superintendent was a Betazoid, a full telepath. When he sent for you to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done.

Bigotry all around, then...

 > **BRAND**: Hello, Captain. I know you're a close friend of the Crusher family.

You might recognize the admiral as [Jacqueline Brookes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Brookes), known more for her stage work, but a mainstay on screen for about thirty years.

 > **PICARD**: This is an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you require any assistance, then the *Enterprise* is at your disposal.

This seems rather self-important of Picard, doesn't it?  The Admiral presumably has the full resources of the entirety of Starfleet at her disposal---including his ship, since she outranks him---but his offer of help carries a clear conflict of interest.

 > **LOCARNO**: Captain, sir.

And you might recognize Locarno as [Robert Duncan McNeill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duncan_McNeill) for his then-future role as the nearly identical but inexplicably not the same Tom Paris on **Voyager**.  Both characters will make fairly brief appearances on the aforementioned **Lower Decks**.

 > **WESLEY**: Captain, Mom, will you excuse us please? Nick and I have some things we need to talk about.

Wow, they might as well have written that line as "we need to crime."

 > **BOOTHBY**: Hey! Can't you see that's a flower bed?

And you might recognize Boothby as [Ray Walston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Walston), who had an extensive career lasting more than fifty years.  But despite his work in film and musical comedy, most people---especially at the time---recognize him as the lead on [**My Favorite Martian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Martian).

 > **PICARD**: Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard, class of twenty-seven.

I suppose that we should do the math, here.  If the first season ends in 2364 in [*The Neutral Zone*]({% post_url 2022-11-10-neutral-zone %}), and we'll hit four years later in a few weeks, then this may take place in 2368.  If Picard graduated in 2327, that comes forty-one years earlier.  Patrick Stewart would have only hit his fifty-first or -second birthday, though, meaning that either his age doesn't match his character, Picard used the Academy as a junior high school, or the writers didn't bother to keep track of the numbers.

Since they allegedly discovered Data twenty-six years prior to [*Datalore*]({% post_url 2022-08-11-datalore %}), but he claimed to graduate from the Academy with the "class of '78" in [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-26-farpoint2 %}), you can probably guess which of the three theories I might agree with...

 > **BOOTHBY**: I know that. What happened to your hair?

This answers the question posed by [*Ensign Ro*]({% post_url 2024-05-30-ensign-ro %})---the episode, not the character---I suppose, asserting that Picard has gone bald as Stewart has.

 > **PICARD**: I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much I appreciate...

It took him decades to say *thank you* to someone who---we'll find out---saved his career?  Seriously, this man needs so much therapy.

 > **SITO**: No. Yes.

You probably won't recognize [Shannon Fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Fill) except for this role.  While she made a few contemporary appearances, she'll show up again in the back half of the final season---shortly before Wesley's own swan song[^1]---and revisits her character in the aforementioned **Lower Decks** flashback set around the time of this episode.

[^1]:  I mean, except for the fact that modern *Star Trek* seems to think that we craved more of the character, and so crams him into random shows that would work far better without some smug, all-powerful being explaining why he can't fix things himself.

 > **LOCARNO**: As we entered Titan's gravitational sphere, I gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation. Remaining in the diamond formation, we executed a low apogee turn around Titan then began a z-plus twenty-five degree climb in preparation for a Yeager loop. Approximately nine seconds later, Cadet Albert's ship collided with Cadet Hajar's. We had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the evac stations at Mimas. Everyone made it except Josh.

We discussed [Chuck Yeager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager) about two months ago while discussing [*New Ground*]({% post_url 2024-07-18-new-ground %}), this episode suggesting that his breaking the sound barrier inspired this loop stunt, somehow.

 > **HAJAR**: We had discussed changing our approach after I filed the flight plan. The final decision was made en route to Saturn. I didn't consider it significant enough to mention here. I apologize for the confusion, sir. I should have been more precise.

How does the hearing not stop right here?  They caught her in an outright lie, because they definitely didn't change their flight plan, but they also changed their flight plan so minimally that she didn't see it as worth mentioning when they directly asked her a yes-or-no question about it.

 > **LOCARNO**: Admiral, Josh was a good pilot, but lately, he'd been having difficulties. He'd get nervous during close flybys and pull away in the final seconds. His formation flying was a little erratic.

This team, remember, represents the best of the students, a group to take pride in even knowing somebody who joined.  And in a largely public forum, they either admit that they don't actually have any standards and don't watch out for each other at the most important moments *or* feel free to blame their dead friend for their problems.  Either way, this incident definitely destroys the institution's reputation beyond repair, and we'll never---oh, no, wait, they'll still exist for another Nova Squadron to become secondary characters in the second season of **Prodigy**, and everybody still considers them role-models for the other cadets.

 > **ALBERT**: Mister Crusher?

This should make the final introduction, even though he has brooded around the episode since the start of the episode.  You might recognize the elder Albert as [Ed Lauter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Lauter), a common character actor for decades, who would occasionally talk in interviews about how everybody recognized him, but nobody could actually identify him.  Oddly, he died about six months after Brookes.

 > **CRUSHER**: There must be something wrong with the satellite data. It might have been tampered with.

I need to stress that, while Brand and her flunky have served as decent and fair prosecutors, the *Enterprise* crew has decided to find any excuse that they can scrounge up to muddy the issue, rather than pursue some objective truth.

 > **BOOTHBY**: Do you remember the parrises squares tournament of 'twenty-four?
 >
 > **PICARD**: The final game against Minsk.

The show's signature imaginary sport, I believe, got its first appearance in [*11001001*]({% post_url 2022-08-25-11001001 %}), this presumably taking place in Picard's first or second years, depending on when the sport's season runs.

While I know the city of [Minsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk), I don't know if this refers to a specific institution that would have a natural rivalry with Starfleet Academy, except to the extent that the original series seemed to imply that the Soviet Union never joined the Federation.  And if they wanted to make that reference, then I find it highly objectionable that they didn't pair this exchange with some kid in a different uniform running by them screaming "[Minsk State Linguistic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_State_Linguistic_University) *invented* parrises squares, Herberts" in a thick pseudo-Russian accent.

 > **BOOTHBY**: Well the cadets today are just as proud of the Nova Squadron. The celebration they held after Nova won the Rigel Cup made 'twenty-four look like a dinner party. To the other cadets, the members of that team are gods, and that's a hard image to live up to. But Nick Locarno, he watches out for them. He keeps them together. Nick is what makes that team special. He's their coach, surrogate father and best friend all in one. A natural leader. The members of that team love him. If he asks them to do something, they do it, even if it means going right over a cliff.

Huh, weird, that sort of behavior doesn't appear *anywhere* else in Starfleet.  I mean, other than every time a captain feels like doing something illegal, and everybody risks their careers and lives to support their surrogate father.  I can't imagine where these kids would've picked that up... {% emoji eyeroll %}

Anyway, [Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel) has gotten many mentions since [*Mudd's Women*]({% post_url 2020-02-20-trek-m-women %}), as recently as [*Half a Life*]({% post_url 2024-04-04-half-life %}), so I feel like telling you about the star at this point would only come off as condescending...

 > **WESLEY**: It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir.

Best guess, the maneuver may refer to [Bob Kolvoord](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HDM8OZ8AAAAJ), newly-minted doctor of theoretical and applied mechanics at the time, and who two years later would publish *Velocity distributions among colliding asteroids*.  If one of the writers knew him personally, I could see them deciding that the quirky-looking name and the field made for a good fit.

 > **PICARD**: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew every control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the Bridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I was convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've never questioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wear that uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place, or I will.

Once again, I can't **imagine** where Wesley got the idea that Starfleet officers would lie to save their friends' reputations.  I mean, other than when he watches the *Enterprise* crew in episodes like [*The Icarus Factor*]({% post_url 2023-02-23-icarus-factor %}) where they cover up erratic readings at Starfleet's recommendation, Picard's shenanigans in [*Ménage à Troi*]({% post_url 2023-10-12-menage-troi %}), or the many times that Picard has cleared out a room so that he could do something blatantly illegal without any witnesses.

 > **LOCARNO**: You're going to tell them what happened? You? Alone? Are you going to decide what happens to me, to Sito, to Jean? You're going to decide that?

Interesting that he refers to everybody by given name except Sito, who I believe gets referred to as "Cadet Sito," suggesting that her "coach, surrogate father and best friend all in one" refuses to accept the Bajoran naming convention.

 > **BRAND**: Captain Satelk and I have gone over your testimony and the physical evidence from the crash. Your statements cannot be reconciled with the data collected from the NavCon satellite. Your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is disappointing, and raises suspicion. We cannot escape the conclusion that either the data is faulty in some way, or you have lied to us. However, suspicion is not proof and I have no proof that you have lied to this inquiry. Therefore, if no further evidence is presented, I have no choice but to close this investigation. For filing an inaccurate flight plan, and for allowing Cadet Albert to fly when you knew he was having difficulties, I am ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of your permanent records. I am also revoking your flight privileges. This inquiry is closed.

Except that she does have proof that at least two of them lied, because they contradicted their own testimony immediately after follow-up questions---Hajar had her "no changes except for the last-minute change" story, then Sito claimed to not know anything about Albert's location, but flew by instruments, but didn't remember anything---and one version does come closer to matching the data.  Add in Locarno claiming that he let a bad pilot onto his elite team and kept him despite (allegedly) increasing worries, and I don't see the indecision.  What happened here, that Brand has gone from an aggressive prosecutor to someone who can only accept full confessions as evidence?

 > **WESLEY**: Sir. I would like to add something to my testimony.

Notice that he waited until after Brand closed the inquiry, as if hoping that she'd tell him to shut up.

 > **PICARD**: You should feel bad, and you will pay for what you've done. Admiral Brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand, your academic credits for the past year will be cancelled, and you will not advance with your class.

Wow, actual consequences.  For an episode that strongly suggests a pervasive atmosphere of corruption, and came *so* close to drawing parallels between Locarno and Picard, that doesn't seem like much more than the prior vague reprimand, but at least gives us something.

That said, it bothers me that the consequences have absolutely nothing to do with the crime.  It looks like the Academy opted for retributive justice to make an example of them---that you might need to re-take a dozen classes, if you conspire to cover up manslaughter---rather than to have them fix anything.

## Conclusions

Other than some shady math, we get surprisingly little out of the episode past the big issue.

### The Good

I suppose that the Academy does hand out some mild disciplinary actions, which even Picard admits feel extremely week.

### The Bad

Reminiscing about the Academy gives our leads the opportunity to engage in naked racism and sexism.  Locarno also seems to exhibit some anti-Bajoran bias.

We seem to see end-to-end corruption, without anybody even noticing it.  The students cover up their part in a friend's death.  The *Enterprise* crew prioritizes their emotional attachments over the truth of the matter, with Picard offering to interfere in the investigation.  And despite catching the students in significant lies, the investigation ends with an assertion that they have no evidence of dishonesty and can't do anything until Wesley confesses.  And yet, they have the hypocrisy to claim that Starfleet always stands for the truth no matter the consequences.

Picard also shows his emotionally stunted nature by taking three or four decades to thank somebody for keeping him in Starfleet.

## Next

Come back in a week, when we find out that the ship tastes great and that the writers still have no respect for Lwaxana Troi in *Cost of Living*.
