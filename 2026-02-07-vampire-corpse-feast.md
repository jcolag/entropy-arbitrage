To give this series some sense of organization, check out some basic facts without much in the way of context.

This should go without saying---even though I plan to repeat it with every Book Club installment---but *Content Advisories* do not suggest any sort of judgment on my part, only topics that come up in the work that I noticed and might benefit from a particular mood or head space for certain audiences.  I provide it to help you make a decision, rather than a decision in and of itself.

## Vampire Corpse Feast

The game's Itch page says this about the game.

> As Butler 13 you are tasked with satisfying the Zamfir family, a group of quirky vampires, that need tasks done so they can all enjoy their feast. They are so happy to have you for dinner!
>
> Made in GB Studio in about 3 days.
>
> ### Credits:
>
> Ahria Nicholas - Programmer
>
> Hogan Coverdale - Writer and Designer
>
> Charlie Klever - Story and Level Designer
>
> Caitlin McBride - Level Programmer

We have that, plus controls, and you know what I know...

## What Works Well?

The game feels consistent, to me.  If you have nostalgia for the [fantasy console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console)'s inspiration, then you'll probably feel at home.  Nothing looked like a placeholder.

And while this might come down to taste, I *think* that the tone works well, openly absurd, but "toy ominous" moments.  The frogs, in particular, feel completely nonsensical but also almost work...

## What Works...Less Well?

{% include lesswell.md %}

As you might guess from the "Made...in about 3 days" comment, the game has some irregular moments.  For example, I "solved" each puzzle before even learning that the problem existed to solve.  And I eventually abandoned the game, not able to understand how to progress; looking at the source code on GitHub (see below) didn't illuminate anything, either, because [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) appears to not represent its logic as text, only long lists of comma-delimited values.

[^t18smw]:  A character has asked for vegetables.  A room allegedly full of thematically appropriate vegetables exist.  But I can't find anything that looks like a key to unlock the door.  And given that the game had already established a pattern of needing more work, I couldn't guess whether I overlooked something on multiple sweeps or they didn't implement the next step.

## Opportunities

It hasn't seen much attention in five years, but a quick search turned up the [game's GitHub repository](https://github.com/charlesklever/vampirecorpsefeast).

## What's Adaptable?

Apart from the Zamfir[^aY1ew9] family itself, we see a few books, **800 Years of European Family Trees**, **101 Vampire Jokes**, **How to Change Your Sleep Schedule in 5 Days**, **Cannibalism for Beginners**, and **The Melodramatic History of Gothic Culture**.  You'll also find the (I assume) band Loveless and the Blood Light beverage.  More might exist past the puzzle that I didn't solve.

[^aY1ew9]:  No pan-flutes seem to have harmed in the making of this game.

## Coming Attractions

Coming up next week, we'll read a sampling of theater projects created in conjunction with Wikimedia Italia.  I want to try to avoid the pieces about real people, and may---I hate to not have a plan ahead of time, but I haven't had the bandwidth to look at the plays themselves, like I normally would---need to run this across multiple weeks, but don't know at this time.

Anyway, while we wait for that, what did everybody else think about the game?
