## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Liaisons

Oh, dear.  Buckle in for this one...

Before we do, though, I should mention that, over on **DS9**, they kicked off their season in one of the strongest incidents of contrasting episodes, rescuing a prisoner of war and worrying about extremists taking over the local government in *The Homecoming*.

 > **WORF**: Klingons do not procrastinate. It is a...tactical delay.

I know that feeling.  I tactically delayed watching this clunker for at least a week...

Also, they apparently still don't make the dress uniforms custom, since tailored clothes don't take *nearly* that much work to adjust.

 > **RIKER**: You have spent about five minutes greeting the Iyaarans maybe an hour making small talk at this reception. I'm the one who has to escort them around the ship for the next three days.

What a whiner.

 > **RIKER**: That is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude. I'm surprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress.

Oh, and some toxic patriarchal garbage, both shaming Worf for his concerns about "feminine" clothing---a nonsense term, by the way, given how quickly clothing styles change---*and* shaming him for wearing the uniform.

 > **PICARD**: Well, Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wide experience in interspecies contact.

They shouldn't spring ideas on me like this.  Now I have to wipe down my laptop after the spit-take.  Really, I think that the closest that we've seen to Riker acting like a diplomat came in, what, [*Starship Mine*]({% post_url 2025-03-20-starship-mine %}), where he avoided and mocked everybody who he didn't come to the party with.

I suppose that he has punched a wide variety of people, and that qualifies as literal contact, but...

 > **PICARD**: Good luck.

Oh, so *none* of them enjoy diplomacy.  In past episodes, they've also shown that they find scientific research boring, and Picard insisted that they don't identify as military.  What, did they sign up with Starfleet to play poker and LARP on the holodeck for all this time?

 > **TROI**: Oh, well, actually, I was waiting until we got to the desserts.

The fact that she has all the discipline of a toddler probably explains a lot about her lack of professionalism.  Actually, skipping meals to scarf down sugar also sounds fairly self-destructive, too, maybe explaining why she keeps giving "avoid your problems to enjoy yourself" advice.

 > **TROI**: Oh, well, let me introduce you to some of my favorites. This is peach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake. And this is my favorite. Ktarian chocolate puff. I don't know exactly what's inside, but I think it's made with seventeen varieties of chocolate.

Wow, seventeen varieties of chocolate sounds...useless, maybe?  Or maybe it sounds unimpressive.  I mean, in our world, this has two possible interpretations.

First, and more commonly, this might refer to place of origin.  And do you know what we call chocolate that blends a wide variety of sources?  We call that the cheap stuff.  You buy a little from Cameroon, some from Peru, a bit from Indonesia, and so forth, and you get a product that evens out any unexpected flavors and automatically compensates for supply chain issues, making it consistent, less expensive, and unremarkable.

Alternatively and more technically, this could refer to [types of chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_chocolate) *products*.  And most of those products, if mixed, would largely serve to eliminate the interesting aspects of each individual product.  If you mix dark chocolate and white chocolate, then you get something that strongly resembles milk chocolate.  And the other forms have mostly physical attributes and tend to have less flavor than the alternatives.

Like [*The Loss*]({% post_url 2024-01-11-loss %}) helpfully informed us that Troi's pleasant demeanor comes from her not wanting to feel it if she makes somebody feel bad, this seems to suggest that she doesn't know more about chocolate than the broadest pedestrian tastes.

 > **TROI**: Ambassador, I think we're going to get along very well. Shall we?

She doesn't need to know anything more than that Loquel likes chocolate, and knows that they have a strong bond...like a toddler would.

 > **WORF**: Ambassador Byleth is demanding, temperamental and rude.
 >
 > **DATA**: You share all of those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you should try to build on your similarities.

I suppose that we should give thanks that Data didn't preface his temperamental and rude (but not demanding) comment with "as a Klingon..."  Worf considers stabbing Data, and I can't say that I don't sympathize.

 > **PICARD**: There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings about two kilometers south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Do you understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back as soon as I can.

I love the "try to stay conscious" bit.  He probably has a concussion, so let's make *him* do the work of taking care of him...

 > **TROI**: No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts last night.

...I have no words.

 > **LOQUEL**: May I give Eric some dessert?
 >
 > **TROI**: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Come on, Eric.

I mean, it sounds like a lazy kidnapping plot to me, but Troi made a big deal about only eating dessert and then "unexpectedly" felt sick after only eating dessert, so I guess somebody needs to get Loquel a windowless white van...

 > **PICARD**: How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you're certainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What's your name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer.

I've commented on Picard's use of ableist terms before, but joking about people losing limbs seems like an entirely new level.

 > **ANNA**: Stardate 40812.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Seven years!

It seems like it should feel more notable that their ship crashed at around the same time that Picard took command of the *Enterprise* prior to [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}).  Figure that episode started at stardate 41153, and assuming that every thousand dates makes a year as it does seasons, that comes to something like four months.

Ah, right.  The glimpse of the dedication plaque that we got in [*Silicon Avatar*]({% post_url 2024-06-06-silicon-avatar %}) tells us that Starfleet commissioned the *Enterprise* on 40759, which would map to something like three weeks before the crash, assuming that the other analysis holds.  This probably has more to do with the writing than anything that we care about in these posts, but why get into such specific dates *and* have them line up so nicely, if they didn't mean to blame Picard for this?

 > **TROI**: He seems preoccupied with recreation. I've spent more time in Ten Forward in the last two days than I have in the past two months. And he's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate.

Hm.  Preoccupied with recreation.  Where have I heard that before...?

Speaking of the sloppy writing, here, it feels like the resolution to this episode makes almost no sense, giving the ambassadors specific experiential goals like some awful video game, instead of taking advantage of the science fiction universe and having them amplify the tendencies of the people that they attach to for observation.  Weirdly, one of them will even voice this possibility, without anybody bothering to think that through for self-reflection.

 > **RIKER**: Maybe we should loosen things up a little bit, meet in a less official capacity. How about a friendly game of poker?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **RIKER**: Wait a minute. Calm down.

Yeah, who ever would've guessed that putting angry people into a competitive situation would make things worse?  I mean besides the jerk who has no sense of planning.

 > **PICARD**: Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! Over here! The door's over here!

Notice that Picard calls for help and...then hides with a weapon to attack his rescuer, I guess.

 > **PICARD**: No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. We humans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never too much, never too little, and it's very nice to find a culture that is willing to take an experience to its furthest extreme.

I'd take back so many bad things that I've said about this show over the years, if Picard and Voval started dating.  They *did* get their first kiss out of the way, and Picard didn't even engage in the show's usual trans-panic garbage...

## Conclusions

Once again, we don't get too much out of this mess, except for my gripes about the writing.

### The Bad

The Federation still doesn't seem to have learned about tailoring, seemingly preferring a one-size-fits-all approach to uniforms.  They do, however, have deep concerns over imagined gender-coding in their clothes, with a clear dislike of any association with femininity.

Everybody seems to loathe working in diplomacy.  They also all seem incredibly superficial, having seemingly uninformed preferences, shallow relationships, and poor impulse control, including digging for shoddy excuses to play games on the job, but also condemn others for their not acting sufficiently serious.  And that doesn't even touch on the anti-Klingon sentiment.

Picard has moved from ableist terminology to ableist jokes.  And he presumes that rescuers mean to attack him.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when La Forge illegally uses a bunch of resources for a family reunion, and the show wastes its biggest guest, in *Interface*.
