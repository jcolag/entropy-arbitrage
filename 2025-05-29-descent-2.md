## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Descent, part 2

Continuing from [the first part]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}) before the season break.

 > **PICARD**: He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you.

The goofy emotion chip plot device originated in [*Brothers*]({% post_url 2023-11-23-brothers %}).

 > **DATA**: Hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense of individuality to them. It nearly destroyed them.

This seems to describe the immediate aftermath of [*I, Borg*]({% post_url 2024-10-17-i-borg %}).

 > Acting Captain's log, supplemental. The skeleton crew left on board the Enterprise is unable to help in the search for Commander Data. The planet's unusual EM field is interfering with the ship's sensors, severely limiting their effectiveness.

Oh, they *did* leave Crusher with some people to help out.  [Part 1]({% post_url 2025-05-15-descent-1 %}) gave the impression that they took everybody down to the planet except her.

 > **SALAZAR**: Forty seven, sir.

You might recognize Salazar as an up-and-coming [Benito Martinez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Martinez_%28actor%29), who'd eventually go on significant parts on shows like **The Shield** and **Sons of Anarchy**, neither of which I've watched, but certainly had their fan bases.

 > **CRUSHER**: Right. Stand by to trigger the conduit. Taitt. I want you to stay on the Bridge. I'll need a Science Officer at the aft station.

Notice Crusher's more modern approach to management, getting to know her people, and refusing to oust them when a white guy comes along.

 > **BARNABY**: Sensors detect no vessels.

I imagine that you'll *probably* recognize Barnaby, or at least his voice, as [James Horan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horan_%28actor%29), who we saw a few weeks ago in [*Suspicions*]({% post_url 2025-04-17-suspicions %}) as Jo'Bril.

 > **HUGH**: You probably can't imagine what it is like to be so lost and frightened that you will listen to any voice which promises change.
 >
 > **WORF**: Even if that voice insists on controlling you.
 >
 > **HUGH**: That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. In the beginning, he seemed like a savior. The promise of becoming a superior race, of becoming fully artificial was compelling. We gladly did everything he asked of us. But after a while, it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before we realized it, this was the result.

Did...

Wait.

Did this show---**this show**---actually engage in progressive social satire and get the metaphor right?  It took them six years (and a summer break), but you'll notice how Lore models every authoritarian, in this story.  He took advantage of a mild problem, promising some variation of "only I can fix it," utterly failed, and began making things worse and blaming the people for not doing enough for him.

However, you'll notice that none of our main cast has an *opinion* on this, other than their personal distaste for Lore.

 > **CRUSHER**: The data-banks should contain information about a process called metaphasic shielding.

Speaking of *Suspicions*...

 > **DATA**: Yes. Please, I want more.

Emotions work like...drugs, I guess?

 > **BARNABY**: Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the Academy. And a student thesis is a long way from a workable plan.

Another creep, you notice, dismissing the ideas of a Black woman because she had an education, I think.

 > **DATA**: Lore is no longer functioning, sir. He must be disassembled so that he is no longer a threat.

Apparently, the Federation doesn't mind a little extrajudicial execution, as a treat.

 > **LAFORGE**: Pleased? Data, you've wanted emotions all your life.

Also, pleasure (and relief before it) sounds like an e...oh, never mind.

 > **LAFORGE**: Data, I wouldn't be very much of a friend if I let you give up on a life-long dream, would I? Maybe someday, when you're ready.

We'll follow up on *this* sometime around the end of the year, I believe.  I don't know why, but we will.  Hugh and his independent Borg will go on to have a small role in **Picard**, as will Lore, later.  Apparently, this episode sits at the crossroads of the entire series.

## Conclusions

We get little to nothing from this one, with even my comments here *maybe* stretching a bit.

### The Good

We see an alternate view of management from the usual screaming and bullying, and it works fairly well.

### The Bad

Even among the lower-ranked members of the crew, we see the dismissive-but-aggressive jockeying for position on projects, in this case insisting that schoolwork has no applicability in the outside world.  This might have racist and sexist aspects to it.

And speaking of bigotries, at least for artificial creatures, anybody has the right to execute them, even if they act outside Federation space, assuming that they believe that suspect might otherwise cause future problems.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when the crew makes the case for us that their pointless slacking actually represents Federation culture, while a concussed Picard tries to play detective in *Liaisons*.
