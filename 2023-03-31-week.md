As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

Also, I don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

I considered writing a full post on this topic, and may still do so.  But honestly, this sums it all up.  And I mean thirty years *fairly* literally, by the way.  In the early-to-mid '90s, at least one company---I've forgotten the name, but it sounded a lot like the description---that had a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)-based system along the lines of but not *quite* an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system).

Much like [Microsoft promoting OpenAI in a research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712), this week, that prior company insisted that they had their system *so close* ü§å to "real" intelligence.  They would assign it comparative descriptors, reporting that it had the reasoning ability of a rat or a human infant or whatever they wanted, because those comparisons don't mean anything, and insisted that their system would only improve as they fed facts and relationships into their database, which would replace the information that people learn through experience.

You can see how well that worked out for them:  I don't remember their name, and you probably don't remember ever hearing about such a thing.  Likewise, Microsoft's attempt to push this narrative falls apart on even the slightest scrutiny.  They can't tell you how to identify intelligence, and wouldn't if they could, because such a revelation would affect animal rights and other fields.  They can only tell you that products feel like *they expect* humans to feel, which tells you what you need to know about them...

I should note that I don't consider artificial intelligence impossible, but I certainly don't think that some company will stumble on it by pouring resources into technologies that we've had and studied since the 1960s.  Instead of "sparks of intelligence," they actually most likely see confirmation bias.

I don't suppose that anybody will find this at all surprising.  Many companies operate on a cult of machismo, where you prove that you "belong" by showing your willingness to work long hours, and everybody suffers for it, because work quality drops *long* before any of us clocks eight hours in the day.  But they'd rather feel like they've gotten free labor than optimize for productivity.

At one point, I actually walked out of an interview, because the hiring manager kept asking me how I prevented my teaching---all night courses, I should point out---from getting in the way of meeting deadlines.  After dancing around the issue for a while, I pointed out that, if his team worked late, then he dramatically mismanaged the project, and packed my things while he fumed.

I don't know that it ever occurred to me how much we collectively waste on holidays, but I've always had some awareness that *I* have celebrated them by going overboard for no reason.  It makes sense, though, since holiday traditions typically have their roots in either celebrating transitory abundance (such as harvest festivals) or using extravagance as a pretext to get people together.  I like that we can see some organized efforts to fix that.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, I drop any additional articles that didn't fit into the one-article-per-day week, but too weird or important to not mention, here.

 > Chronic pain complicates our understanding of health and illness --- we expect pain to be a sign of something being wrong, an example of cause and effect, and imagine that once we are better, it will stop hurting. As the title of this zine, ‚ÄòWhen Language Runs Dry‚Äô, suggests, chronic pain is an experience that is sometimes hard to communicate.

I never had much interest in 'zines, even though you'd think that it would fit neatly with a lot of my other interests, but I think that this does a nice job of showing what fans of the form love.
