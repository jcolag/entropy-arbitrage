As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), this is my weekly Twitter roundup.  Note that tweets of articles generally include header images from the articles, which are not included here unless they *happen* to be available under a free license.  Most are not.  But I now add most of my commentary here, where I'm not restricted by the message length.

![diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week](/blog/assets/CLM_14456_71r_detail.png "diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week")

I also don't generally attach pictures to posts with quotations.

 > If you do plan to vote by mail, voting early can help ensure that the USPS is not overwhelmed at the last minute.

It shouldn't have ever come to this---no other government agency is expected to turn a profit, and it's difficult to even imagine a scenario where we'd need to stand up for the Air Force or CIA---but since it has, here we are.

Yet another reason to [rethink policing]({% post_url 2020-05-31-police %}), not that this is new information.

 > Self-reliance was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms, but emotional control was not.

Just...be careful, everyone.  Our culture tries to imagine men---especially men of color---as outside of society and never in need of anything, and we all suffer for it.  When you need help, **get help**.  You're not alone.

 > ...a close Trump ally, tweeted that she was “a lock em up and throw away the key prosecutor,” while...Pence called her “soft on crime.”

Oddly, the article (like many progressives) seems to forget that Harris has also been a Senator for several years, which means a public voting record.  A fairly easy way of finding out what policies she really supports is to literally look up what policies she has recently supported.

 > Lately, he’s thanked himself for unilaterally sending troops into American cities.

I think of him as the sort of person who never realized that "you're not chosen for teams, because they're jealous; you're so good that you'll make everyone look bad" in school was a lie.

## Bonus

Because it accidentally became a tradition early on in the life of the blog, here's a sixth and seventh article that didn't fit into the week, but too weird to not mention.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Dear White Vegans, Stop Appropriating Food](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv833z/dear-white-vegans-stop-appropriating-food) from VICE World News

 > ...people of colour, especially Black people, are more likely to give up meat than white people.

I still eat meat, but like vegetable-based meals a lot, and it's often uncomfortable to find what's obviously a traditional recipe with no context beyond a continent.  Coming from a part of the United States where the owner of an Italian restaurant can expect to be interrogated over what part of Italy their establishment represents, I know we can do better than just calling something "African."  And that's a bare minimum.

<i class="fas fa-square"></i> [Stay-at-home orders worked to slow COVID’s spread](https://www.futurity.org/stay-at-home-orders-covid-19-2422172/) from Futurity

 > ...the number of cases doubled in less than three days before mitigation measures were put into place. In contrast, after mitigation measures, the number of cases took more than two weeks to double.

This should be the most obvious thing in the world, but we somehow keep needing to constantly prove that the most rudimentary science works.
