## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Timescape

Checking in on the other show, since last time, **DS9** had energy-creatures possess some of the crew to take control of the station in *Dramatis Personae*, and they fight over what to do about an alleged war criminal in *Duet*.

Meanwhile, this episode mostly focuses on its plot, so don't expect too much.

 > **RIKER**: I told him I'd feed him while he was gone. I was just putting down the bowl of food. The next thing I know there's a hissing ball of fur coming at my face. I hate cats.

Yeah, it tracks that Riker can't deal with cats.  If he treats cats the way that we've seen him treat people, he should count himself lucky that Spot didn't do far worse in retaliation...

 > **WORF**: We are picking up a distress call on long range sensors. It is Romulan, sir.
 >
 > **RIKER**: Romulan?

I'll skip most of the conversation, here, because "paranoia" covers almost all of it.  They assume that the Romulans must have faked their emergency to lure them into some ambush and destroy them...because they asked for help.

 > **TROI**: I was just leaving the reception when this Ktarian walks up to me and says, hello, Diane. I understand you're an empath. I'm a very sensitive man myself. I'm doing a thesis on interspecies mating rituals. Would you care to join me in some empirical research?

Oh, good, let's make fun of people's accents.  Picard will do the same in a bit.

Also, she tells them about sexual harassment as a cute anecdote, and not a formal report of exclusionary and dangerous misbehavior.

 > **TROI**: To be honest, I was bored. I spent most of my time at Professor Wagner's phylobiology seminar. I thought the idea of the seminar was that we would all participate, bring different points of views to the discussion. He gathered two hundred scientists from all over the Federation, and all he did was put us to sleep.
 >
 > **DATA**: I have a memory record of the entire lecture, Counselor. I can repeat the portions you missed, if you---
 >
 > **TROI**: No, thank you, Data.

...I hate these people.  My parents used to say that "only boring people get bored."  And yet, they can't seem to do anything else, half the time.  If they wanted entertainment, maybe they should've gone to a circus instead of an academic conference, or locked themselves in their bedrooms to sulk.

 > **PICARD**: Well, we have to find some way of staying unfrozen. Mister La Forge, what about a subspace force field like the one we used on Devidia Two? Could something like that protect us from the effects of the temporal fragment?

We visited Devidia II in [*Time's Arrow*]({% post_url 2024-11-07-time-s-arrow-1 %}).

 > **PICARD**: There are three Romulans, all of them with disruptors. One at conn. There are none of our security officers on the Bridge. They must have taken us by surprise. It appears that we can move objects in this time frame.

That sounds plausible, except for all the people who we see doing their jobs normally.

I should note that, as Troi makes her way to sickbay, she nearly plows into an officer, because she didn't bother to look ahead.

 > **TROI**: Whatever happened, this is beginning to look less and less like a Romulan attack.

Other than zapping Crusher, nothing remotely looked like a Romulan attack except for their assertions...

 > **TROI**: He's in neural shock.

Did she take some actual medical classes at some point?  And she has taken her counseling job more seriously over the past few weeks.  That uniform has done wonders for her.

 > **DATA**: Captain, I believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity, which the Romulans use in their engine, for a natural one. A black hole. They tried to use it as a nest.

Data has apparently taken to rephrasing what other people say, to claim it as his idea, because I didn't find him insufferable enough before this.

 > **ALIEN 2**: You must stop!

We saw her briefly earlier, but now that she had a line, I should mention that [Pat Tallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Tallman) plays her.  We've seen her before as unnamed members of the crew in episodes such as [*Power Play*]({% post_url 2024-08-22-power-play %}) and [*Starship Mine*]({% post_url 2025-03-20-starship-mine %}), plus some stunt work where we might not identify her at a glance.

 > Captain's log, stardate 46945.3. We successfully evacuated the crew of the Romulan ship, and we're on course to the Neutral Zone to bring them home.

Did a second Romulan ship show up at some point?  I thought they only had one, which vanished, presumably along with an unconscious La Forge.

 > **DATA**: I have been testing the aphorism, 'a watched pot never boils'. I have boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty-two times. In some cases, I have ignored the kettle. In others, I have watched it intently. In every instance, the water reaches its boiling point in precisely fifty-one point seven seconds. It would appear that I am not capable of perceiving time any differently than my internal chronometer.

I've said this so many times before, but why does Data not have a dictionary?  Even Wiktionary indicates that [a watched pot never boils](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_watched_pot_never_boils) refers to the **appearance** of the passage of time, not a literal change.  Instead, though, he decides to waste our time with this overly literal nonsense.

 > **RIKER**: Data, people do not have internal chronometers. Why don't you see what happens if you turn yours off?

...Don't we have internal chronometers?  Granted, we don't have discrete hardware clocks, but we definitely have a [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock), not to mention all the biological processes that change with age and general metabolism.  We might not have convenient time-stamps imprinted on every thought, but we can generally estimate how long things take without too many external cues.

## Conclusions

As mentioned, this episode focuses mostly on its plot, and Riker's unappealing hatred of cats.  Still...

### The Good

With some missteps, Troi seems to finally want to take her job seriously, even acknowledging and using some medical training.

### The Bad

As with many episodes, this one centers the irrational paranoia about Romulan attacks, concocting an entire fictional story about why they might have asked for help, then refuse to acknowledge evidence that a frozen tableau shows cooperation and not an invasion.  And when a Romulan ship vanishes, they don't bother to question what happened to the people aboard.

People find two things extremely funny, apparently, sexual harassment and making fun of foreign accents.  They also seem to need constant stimulation, or they object to experiences where they don't get it.

Apparently, they can lightly paraphrase what everybody heard a foreigner say and claim it as their own analysis, with everybody treating it as an original idea.

We also see the anti-intellectual trend, with Data continuing to not look words up, and Riker seeming to think that we can only tell time with physical clocks.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when we wonder how the attempted genocide of the Borg panned out, in *Descent*, part 1.
