{:toc}

As [discussed previously]({% post_url 2019-12-31-new-year %}), on Fridays, I present my weekly social media roundups.  Note that toots of articles generally include header images from the articles, which I don't include here unless their creators *happen* to have released them for use under a free license, and I notice.  Most have not, or I don't notice.  But I now add my commentary here, where I don't feel restricted by message length.

![Three angles on a cyberpunk mastodon](/blog/assets/cyberdon-color.png "While these posts do eventually deserve a new header image, I don't think that this will do it in the long term...")

This post doesn't *actually* do that, because events conspired this week to keep me from getting my act together on the daily posts.  Instead, especially since the blog's sixth anniversary passed this week, this seemed like a good time to talk about how these specific posts came about.

## Twitter

You probably can guess where the format of these posts originated, by the subheading, if nothing else.

I don't recall when I signed up for a Twitter account, but I immediately didn't care for it, other than---starting almost exactly this time of year in 2011, it appears---occasionally reaching out to quasi-celebrities[^5GoP7A], I guess imagining that I'd make friends or something.  I mostly read posts from people who I follow, rarely even posting in that context, and starting to see Twitter like I do Facebook or LinkedIn:  I have an account there in case somebody looking for me starts there, but otherwise don't engage with it.

[^5GoP7A]:  As I look at the tweets now, quite a few of those attempted connections have absolutely not aged well, and the same goes for the early Mastodon toots that I'll mention later.  I preserved the entire archive, so feel free to click the "Older" links on the archived posts that I link to later if you want, but I'd as soon forget that I tried to associate with such people.  [Sydney Padua](https://sydneypadua.com/) looks like the only exception.

A couple of years later, Twitter started to seem more indispensable in the general discourse, so it seemed (at the time) worth making sure that I at least had *some* active presence there.

It looks like I stumbled across the format of a link to some interesting article and a quote in April 2014, posting a [Napoleon quote](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/twitter/453201052712849408/) (with annotation) on the seventh of the month, followed the next morning by a Wired story on [drug cartels abducting engineers to run their radio networks](https://jcolag.codeberg.page/twitter/453517652284411905/).

## Adjustments

While I can't recall if I had any specific process for any of this, I didn't have a day-job for most of 2014---paying the bills with small consulting gigs until I could find a more permanent position of interest---so process also didn't matter.  I also spent [a lot of time on Quora]({% post_url 2020-01-12-quora %}) and started [adding projects to GitHub](https://github.com/jcolag?tab=overview&from=2014-12-01&to=2014-12-31) at around the same time, for context, and for similar reasons of wanting something like an Internet presence beyond a single-page, static website at the time.

### Scheduling

In 2015, though, I started heavily looking for and found that then-permanent position, and so needed to think more about processes.  I couldn't, for example, bring myself to use company resources for my social media use (though plenty of people assured me that had become "normal"), and couldn't take time every day to look for the next thing.  Those constraints brought me to pre-scheduling the tweets over the weekend, using a service that also (if I ever bothered to check) would give me metrics on how many people clicked the link.

As I have probably mentioned before, deciding to schedule the links for shortly after nine o'clock came from planning for the case[^UHymSA] where colleagues questioned my Twitter usage.  That project started every day with a daily standup meeting in the office, where everybody could see that I didn't have a computer or phone in front of me, making it clear that I didn't do it on company time.  Scheduling the quotes for around noon probably had similar motivation of people seeing me at that time, though I didn't generally have two meetings per day.

[^UHymSA]:  This never arose, by the way.  None of my colleagues have *ever* mentioned my online presence, other than rare projects on GitHub.

### Theming

Oh, and at some point, I decided that I wanted to at least mostly restrict quotes to sources in the public domain or (more rarely) from Free Culture works.  I took a freer hand in the early days, often using quotes from relatively recent figures, but realized that even though a quote that fits in a tweet certainly qualifies as Fair Use (primarily educational, using a tiny portion of the work, and probably not impacting the market), it feels inappropriate to not have consent.  And it makes the search more interesting.

After that, I started trying to lean into the [history, heritage, and pride months](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/2022/07/03/reading.html), paying tribute as well as I can to ten disadvantaged groups[^IZpPFD] across nine months, so that I don't find myself always going to the same wells of people who *coincidentally* look like me.

[^IZpPFD]:  Specifically, as the post calls out, I try to celebrate Black History in February, Women's History in March, Arab American Heritage in April, alternating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage with Jewish American Heritage in May, LGBT Pride in June, Disability Pride in July, Hispanic Heritage in late September and early October, Filipino American History in (later) October, and Native American and Alaskan Native Heritage in December.

I should note that these two principles do *not* play well together.  Because the United States [doesn't have the best track record]({% post_url 2025-11-30-locally-sourced-hate %}) in dealing with anybody other than heterosexual, cisgender, white, Christian men with no history of disabilities, we often don't do a great job of recording and preserving their thoughts.  Celebrating Arab American Heritage and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage often feel especially galling, because some of our first representatives from those groups worked as writers, whether journalists, novelists, or poets.  But it takes a lot of effort to dig up any leads on getting access to works by the [Pen League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjar#The_Pen_League), let alone translations, leaving me sometimes to both draw on the same handful of writers, but also to use optical character recognition to convert individual pages to Arabic text, to then translate into English to see if I can find anything that concisely captures a thought.  And in some cases, if I can't find anything new there *or* a United States federal official speaking in their role, I abandon the "American" part of those celebrations, to broaden the celebration to people from their regions of origin.

## Entropy Arbitrage

The other big change---sometime between setting the posting schedule and changing the thematic aspects of the quotes---came with the blog; this blog, in fact, if you found that confusing.  Somewhat concerned that I might have some trouble keeping the blog active, these [social media roundup](/blog/tag/link-dump) posts provided at least one point during the week when (by definition) I would already have the material to post.

In addition, I don't actually *like* social media---I value the handful of relationships that I have made there, but wish that we had a better system that didn't feel like performance---and assume that most of my readers don't, either, so a home for "I posted this, and you don't need to go anywhere to follow me" makes sense.  After all, unless you *only* do that (as I did for a decade or so), it doesn't make much sense to have a personal website, only to tell people to go visit a bunch of different websites to read what you've written.  These Friday posts ensure that, if you take an interest in my writing, you can get it here.

Finally, collecting the posts provides me the opportunity and excuse to provide more of an opinion and perspective than "you might want to read this."

## Mastodon

I signed up for Mastodon in late 2017---it launched in early 2016, so I had some sense of the value early on---and walked a similar path as I did with Twitter, occasionally reaching out to people but otherwise ignoring it.

When it became clear that I wouldn't want to stay on Twitter, though, at the end of 2022, I started [cross-posting the daily posts](https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/109603007441946889) from almost-{% x %} to Mastodon.  That paved the way for changing the cross-posting direction a couple of weeks later, and eventually cutting Twitter off entirely at the end of January 2023 during that first exodus.

Mastodon also gave me the opportunity to drop all third-party scheduling services, because you can schedule toots from the API[^HRTaCl], allowing me to write a [script to set the schedule](https://codeberg.org/jcolag/tool-trunk/src/branch/main/schedule.rb), based on parsing the usual structure of these posts (`parse.rb` in the same repository).  That, and using my RSS feed reader in smarter ways, has made the scheduling more consistent and a function of the server, rather than some random third-party.

[^HRTaCl]:  For reasons that continue to elude me, they still haven't made those options part of the core user interface, but they absolutely exist.

At this point, I really only have three pieces missing that I'd like to find some way to automate away:

- Currently, I need to manually find the published post ID to back-fill in the blog post, because the Mastodon API doesn't provide any apparent way to get the information in advance[^ZOx4YK].
- In a busy news week, I can collect around a thousand "important" articles in a week, meaning that it can take hours to pare the list down to the six-to-eight most interesting that I want to mention[^Wa2dU3]; I need to find some way of at least hacking out the duplicates, the stories that'll show up again next week, the sources that might already get too much attention, and so forth.
- Something that I don't even bother thinking about, I should probably @-mention the sources that publish on the Fediverse, since they support the ecosystem to some extent and deserve recognition for that.

[^ZOx4YK]:  The API does return a URL where you can look at the draft of the toot in case you need to edit it, but not the final "permalink."

[^Wa2dU3]:  That had a lot to do with posts not going out this week, in fact.  I had a lot to do over the weekend and a long list of articles to sift through, and then the days started flying by.  How did I have time to write two thousand words for *this*, then?  I forced myself to do it first thing this morning, when I realized that Friday had come with nothing to fill the post, which probably explains why it feels so scattered...

Other than those items, I have finally gotten this process as close to foolproof as I can make it, given that I use news from the prior week.

## The Future

At least for the moment, I have no specific plans to change how these posts---the toots or the Friday collection of them---but I do feel like the time has come for *some* change.  If anybody has suggestions, I'll probably at least consider anything other than "put much more time into this every week" or suggesting a different editorial policy on which articles and quotes that I pick...

In the immediate future, though, I hope {% emoji crossed fingers %} to get back to a normal schedule for next week.  And I'll try to make use of the new post labels[^Y9n0S-] to indicate the article topics, hopefully making it less trouble to find something that you remember.

[^Y9n0S-]:  For those of you who don't read the [developer diary](/blog/tag/dev-journal) posts, the blog posts' *tags* do double-duty, both trying to aid navigation around the blog and going out as hashtags to social media announcements, so I use them sparingly.  As of a couple of weeks ago, I introduced the similar *labels* behind the scenes, which only operate on the blog side, so I don't need to worry as much about using too many.

## Bonus

I might as well at least try to uphold the tradition of a bonus article, right?

 > Not only were progressives and leftists writing crime fiction, but it was seen as an appropriate and respectable use of their time. And far from posing an intractable conflict, the genre seemed tailor-made to their worldview. Raymond Chandler’s politics were less firmly established than Dashiell Hammett’s, but the themes he returned to again and again were corruption, class conflict, and the social origins of crime. His detective Philip Marlowe is perpetually suspicious of the powerful and the guardians of so-called order. Marlowe gets knocked around by the actual cops plenty in Chandler’s stories.

Honestly, while I hate the term "leftist," almost all genres seem ripe for reinvention by liberals and progressives.  Fantasy can tell more stories than racial determinism and Chosen One arcs.  Space opera can interrogate the colonial structures that led to the vision of the future.  Two-fisted archaeologists can point out that, no, it does **not** belong in a museum, in fact; it belongs in a sensitively managed UNESCO World Heritage Site, loaned out when the country can get back some of the artifacts stolen from its tombs over the last couple of centuries.

 > The researchers assessed mild cognitive impairment through three types of cognition: memory (participants’ recall of 10 words immediately after hearing them and again after five minutes), working memory (subtracting seven from 100 over five trials), and attention and processing speed (counting backward from 20 to 10 over two trials).

I hate that I've had to become something of a health advocate, but if you have it within your power---I know that some people don't---eating well, exercising, and getting good sleep pays off *so* much better than almost anything else that you can do for yourself.
