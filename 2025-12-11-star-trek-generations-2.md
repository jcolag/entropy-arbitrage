## Disclaimer

In these posts, we discuss a non-"Free as in Freedom" popular culture franchise property, including occasional references to part of that franchise behind a paywall.  My discussion and conclusions carry a Free Culture license, but nothing about the discussion or conclusions should imply any attack on the ownership of the properties.  All the big names serve as trademarks of the owners, and so forth, and everything here relies on sitting squarely within the bounds of [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), as criticism that uses tiny parts of each show to extrapolate the world that the characters live in.

## Previously...

I initially outlined the project [in this post]({% post_url 2020-01-02-trek-00 %}), for those falling into this from somewhere else.  In short, we attempt to use the details presented in *Star Trek* to assemble a view of what life looks like in the Federation.  This "phase" of the project changes from previous posts, however.  **The Next Generation** takes place long after the original series, so we shouldn't expect similar politics and socialization.  Maybe more importantly, I enjoy the series less.

In plain language, you shouldn't read this expecting a recap or review of an episode.  Many people have done both endlessly over nearly sixty years.  You *will* find a catalog of information that we learn from each episode, though, so expect everything to potentially "spoil" a story for a series that ended decades ago.

Rather than list every post in the series here, you can quickly find them all on [the *Star Trek* tag page](/blog/tag/star-trek/).

## Star Trek Generations

Picking up where we left off [last time]({% post_url 2025-12-04-star-trek-generations-1 %}), more or less.

 > **DATA**: I am sorry I let you down. I have not been behaving like myself lately.

I mean...he wastes everybody's time with semantic nonsense, fails to act[^z9QNBp] in any meaningful way, and insists on making himself the center of attention.  Nothing has really changed, here.

[^z9QNBp]:  No pun intended.

 > **PICARD**: It's our mortality that defines us, Soran. It's part of the truth of our existence.

The franchise really loves the creepy idea that death gives life meaning.

 > **B'ETOR**: He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship. He must be the only engineer who doesn't go to engineering.

And so begins the franchise's obsession with appropriating jokes that fans tell each other and shoving them into the script, while congratulating themselves for the uncompensated collaboration...

 > **RIKER**: Lock phasers and return fire! Deanna, take the helm. Get us out of orbit.

After her showing in [*Thine Own Self*]({% post_url 2025-09-11-thine-own-self %}), giving her any actual work feels like a bold move.  Or maybe this works like big Silicon Valley companies, where when the company goes into free-fall, they name a woman as the CEO and pat themselves on the back for social progress while they start selling off stock...

 > **DATA**: Perhaps. Yes! Yes, if we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and trigger the cloaking device. Excellent idea, sir!

Add "still toadying" to the list of things that haven't changed about his personality.

 > **DATA**: Yes! Mmph!

Yes, killing dozens in self-defense really brings that warm, fuzzy feeling deep in everybody's heart.

 > **LAFORGE**: Farrell!
 >
 > **FARRELL**: Yes.
 >
 > **LAFORGE**: There's no one with these kids. Let's get them to the W-tube. We'll find the parents later.

Did he...hand off a bunch of kids to the first woman he saw, as if he can't take responsibility for them?  He doesn't *do* anything other than escape.

 > **RIKER**: All hands, brace for impact!

When I talk about how much of this franchise has become "live readings of the technical references," this sequence makes an excellent case study, because the exterior shots of the crash come right out of **The Star Trek:  The Next Generation Technical Manual** (1991), a multipart diagram showing a crash landing for the saucer.

Yes, I have a copy that has somehow survived several moves when other books have vanished.  No I won't pull it off the tightly packed shelf to get you a page number...

Anyway, elsewhere, Picard makes his way through the force field to get into a poorly choreographed fist fight.  Soran launches the missile, pulling he and Picard into the Nexus, and destroying the rest of the solar system, as we fade to black.

When I saw this in the theater with friends, a relatively quiet crowd, I couldn't help myself, so asked aloud "well *now* what are we supposed to watch...?"  I take pride in the fact that my off-the-cuff joke got more laughs in the theater than any of Data's antics.

 > **PICARD**: René! Come here. Go and help your aunt.

Not a relevant line, but we see that, assuming that Picard didn't waste all his fantasy on literal set-dressing, Christmas tree ornaments now have little star pulses in them.

 > **THOMAS PICARD**: Papa, help me build my castle.
 >
 > **PICARD**: Yes I will, in a few minutes.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > **PICARD**: Go on. Go on without me.

You know, I complain about the writing more often than I'd like, but it feels almost perfect for Picard to whine about his lack of family, get dumped into his immersive fantasy with exactly that family, and he blows off his kids as soon as they want to spend time with him.  Cat, cradle, spoon, etc.

 > **KIRK**: I don't know. I was aboard the Enterprise-B in the deflector control room. Stir these, will you?
 >
 > **PICARD**: Ow!

Ha!  Yes, the cerebral Jean-Luc Picard grabbed the metal part of a hot pan.

 > **PICARD**: You are a Starfleet Officer. You have a duty...
 >
 > **KIRK**: I don't need you to lecture me. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was in diapers. Besides which, I think the galaxy owes me one. All right, I was like you once, so completely blinded by duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? An empty house. Not this time. This time I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia that I want to marry her. This time it's going to be different.

I don't care about Kirk's specific issues, here, but I like that, especially following on from [*All Good Things...*]({% post_url 2025-11-20-all-good-things-2 %}), that he calls Picard out on his moralizing manipulation.

And Picard, for the record, planned to walk in on a couple about to get engaged in their bedroom.

 > **KIRK**: I must have jumped that fifty times. Scared the hell out of me. Except this time. Because it isn't real.

Again, not the line itself, but while certain working-class people need to do it routinely for survival or work, can you think of a more wealth-coded hobby than horseback riding?  And don't forget that, before these two, Pike rambled about the joys of horse ownership in [*The Menagerie*]({% post_url 2020-03-26-trek-menagerie-1 %}), too.

 > **KIRK**: You know if Spock were here, he'd say I was an irrational, illogical human being for taking on a mission like that. Sounds like fun.

By the way, since he brings it up, do you know what probably could've convinced Kirk to help even faster?  Picard could've mentioned that he has met McCoy[^mgY6uX] during [*Encounter at Farpoint*]({% post_url 2022-05-19-farpoint1 %}), Spock in [*Unification*]({% post_url 2024-07-04-unification-part-2 %}), and Scott in [*Relics*]({% post_url 2024-12-12-relics %}).  More than half the main cast surviving into the next century seems like a potentially big draw for returning to life.

[^mgY6uX]:  Yes, technically, we only know that "the admiral" visited the ship, but we all know who they meant, and this would've made a decent time to admit it...

 > **KIRK**: It's the least I could do for the Captain of the Enterprise. It was fun. Oh, my.

Again, you'd think that they'd connect this scene---Kirk's death---with the deaths of Robert and René, or pretty much anything else...

 > Captain's log, stardate 48650.1. Three Starfleet vessels have arrived in orbit and have begun to beam up the Enterprise survivors. Our casualties are light but unfortunately the *Enterprise* herself cannot be salvaged.

Well, they can't salvage the ship, until La Forge decides to do it as a hobby project, as we discover in the final season of **Picard**.  This gives yet another hint that Starfleet and the Federation have budgetary constraints.  If they didn't, then they would almost certainly collect or destroy the debris.  I mean, they presumably wouldn't want that pre-industrial society developing enough to travel their solar system only to find half an interstellar warship.

 > **RIKER**: Speak for yourself, sir. I plan to live forever. I always thought I'd get a shot at this chair one day.

To this day, it infuriates me that Picard doesn't respond by telling him to take the chair with him.  Nobody needs it in the wreckage, certainly, and this film loves nothing so much as winking at the audience.

 > **PICARD**: You may still, Will. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name *Enterprise*. Picard to *Farragut*. Two to beam up.

We know from [*Obsession*]({% post_url 2020-11-05-obsess %}) that Kirk originally served on a presumably earlier *Farragut*, so maybe they chose the ship trying to bring the story full-circle...but given how this has gone, probably not.

## Quick Commentary

Can I step away from the project of deciphering the Federation's culture, for a moment, and point out how, in a lot of ways, this story somehow feels worse than [**The Final Frontier**]({% post_url 2022-04-14-tff %})?  And it seems strange, because the first act or prologue sets feels like it wants to set up an interesting run.  Then---a lot like **The Final Frontier**, as I think about it, which similarly started out light but interesting---everything lurches between unspeakably dire and goofy shtick.

And that doesn't even get to the narrative weirdness, like the loose threads that feel like somebody forgot to tie together that I mentioned, but also *the entire plot*.  Soren can't use a ship to get into the Nexus, because a ship can't survive, OK.  But Kirk got in from the damaged ship, as did part of Guinan, so the ship only needs to survive long enough for whatever transubstantiation nonsense the metaphor thinks it wants.  And speaking of all that, if that doesn't really mean that Soran can't torpedo himself into the ribbon, then not to repeat an argument that fans have had for decades, but did Picard even get out?

Guinan says that time doesn't matter in the fantasies, so Picard can explore any part of his imaginary family life that he pleases, but that doesn't necessarily map to the outside world.  And Picard's fantasy world producing Guinan, Kirk, and a rewrite of his big failure feels like it also better fits the (ham-fisted) theme of Picard taking his family for granted to go on grand adventures, if he even does that in his afterlife paradise.  It would also explain why no Soran-in-paradise shows up to try to stop the captains from leaving.  And---to finally get to the "use a torpedo" part---it explains why something so dangerous to enter has a convenient exit.  I don't point this out to have the tired "do the next three movies even exist" argument, but rather to point out how shoddy the story feels.

On top of everything else, Picard also *never* has the big moment where any of this helps him deal with his loss.  I suppose that this goes back to the loose threads, but why make such a big deal about killing his family and his inability to deal with the grief, if that doesn't figure into the story?  Kirk, you notice, actually has a full arc, so the writers know how to do it.  He starts the episode feeling lost, especially when confronted with his friends having adult children, sacrifices his life instead of succumbing to the temptation to Peter Pan his career again, gets his fantasy second chance at a private life, and walks away from it, because he realizes that all matters less to him than "making a difference" to the galaxy at large, even if that means an anonymous grave somewhere.  Picard, though, mopes about his loss for a couple of scenes, has a fantasy sequence undoing at least one death, gets into an ill-advised fist-fight, and commits to...covering up that he failed to save millions of lives the first time, I guess?

I do love the music, though.  That may explain my warm feelings for the film over the years, since I definitely haven't re-watched it since the theatrical run.

## Conclusions

This part of the film has less for us than the first, but we can still squeeze a bit out of it.

### The Bad

We have had the return of the idea that life has no real meaning without death.  But they turn killing in self-defense into an impromptu celebration.

People casually assume that women should take responsibility for any errant children in an emergency.

Picard, at least, views himself directly as some sort of moral arbiter.  He lectures a dead colleague who once outranked him on duty.  He tries to walk in on an engaged couple in their bedroom.

And maybe related, the film reinforces the idea that Starfleet officers largely come from privileged backgrounds.  And likewise, we see that organizations such as Starfleet weigh the expected return on investment when presented with the possibility of salvaging a ship.

### The Weird

While technically only seen in fantasy, celebrations of Christmas seem to have turned to some late-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century form.  They have added minor technical flourishes, but not much else.

## Stay Tuned...

Come back in a week, when Picard tries to get a piece of the zombie craze, in the first half of **First Contact**...the film, not [the episode]({% post_url 2024-02-15-first-contact %}).
